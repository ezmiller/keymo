Getting Spliced: Modernism and Sexual Difference,"p.099-100 Modernism def'n in poetry cannot explain Women writers 

such as Stein, Marianne Moore, H.D., Mina Loy, Djuna Barnes, Laura Riding.    This is Perloff's critique in The Dance of Intellect.  Esp. those defn's that have adopted the language of Pound for instance.  Focus on parataxis/juxtaposition and the idea  that as ""the constellation of 'luminous details' in a pattern of generges that Kenner has described at length (for example, in his claim that in Pound's <i>Homage to Sextus Propertius, 'the words lie flat like the forms on a Cubist surface.')."" (98)  Also Poundian modenrism defined acc. to Perloff in terms of ""the break with lyric, the use of collage poetics, and the logopoeic 'attitude of mind'..."" (100)  

BUT Burke points out that Pound's early theoretical writing on logopoeia mentioned M. Moore and M. Loy as examples even though Pound ignored their gender.  And Burke argues the point is precisely that Pound ignored their gender.  ""Genius"" was ""coded"" masculine for him. (100) So it seems Burke says that he assumed, as opposed to the ""sentimental poetesses of the nineteenth century, intelligent modern women like Moore and Loy wrote just like men."" (100)  But Pound's masculinism prevented him from seeing something important about Loy and Moore's writing: ""...because of Pound's self-imposed limitations of thought about the links between gender and creativity (which will be explored briefly in a later section), he could not see that logopoeia in the hands of a female poet might produce a different kind of cultural critique, one that focused on issues of gender.""

"""The Foundations of All Future Researches"": Franz Boas, George Hunt, Native American Texts, and the Construction of Modernity","p. 483 - 484 Existing Lit on Hunt-Boas collaboration.

They  note a wealth of sources by Ira Jacknis and Judith Berman about the Hunt-Boas partnerhips and correspondence, and they think this material makes possible a detailed examination of discursive practices and language ideology.  They disagree with treatment by others (Jacknis & Berman also?) in that this correspondence is treated as a fragment or special dimension of Boas' work that ""esceaped some of the positivist trappings of Boas's historical particularism.""  (484)  They want to see these texts as continguous with Boas's larger project and as providing ""revealing windows on the manner in which Boas sought to construct anthropology and to locate its practitioners--and the objects of their inquiries--within North American society and within a master narrative of modernity.""

The Making of a Feminine Professional Identity: Social Workers in the 1920s,"p. 1073- 4 Professional Worker

The Professional Worker, Walkowitz says, was an image that emerged at the end of the 20s, when issues of lack of adequate salary became first and foremost on the minds of social workers.  They were no longer in a ""'professional' conciliatory mode ,but [had] ended the decade of the 1920s talking about proletarian issues.  The limits of their professional equality and autonomy, of being consulted but lacking authority in fundamental ways..."" (1074)  So he puts forward the Professesional Worker as a ""trade unionist"" who was explicitly subordiante to men and a ""neutered construction."""
A category of the human mind: the notion of person; the notion of self,"p. 13 - 17 The Latin ""persona""

He introduces the idea: ""...the Latin <i>persona</i>: a mask, a tragic mask, a ritual mask, and the ancestral mask."" (13)

India

This seems to him to be the oldest ""civilization"" that was ""aware of the notion of the individual, of his consciousness -- may I say, of the 'self' (moi).  He examine terminology from this period.  But there is discussion about wheter the self is whole or composite.  Aham = I and is the same as Indo-European ""ego"".  There is a school samkhya which argues (like Buddhism) that the self is illusory thta it is really composite.  (13)

China

The indiviudal and esp. ""his social status"" here is ""rigorously categorized."" (14)  Here the term is ming.  But he says that ""[w]henever they philosophized about it, whenever certain metaphysical schools they have attempted to explain waht it is, they have said of the individual that he is a compose, made up of <i>shen</i> adn <i>kwei</i> -- two ther collective nouns -- in this life.  Taoism and Buddhism also went down this road, and the notion of the 'person' (<i>personne</i>) ceased to evolve."" (14)

---

But it was the Romans or Latins he think that really developed the idea of person, persona, personne in which the 'person'..is more than an organisaitonal fact, more than a name or  right to assume a role and a ritual mask.  It is a basic fact of law."" (14)

He notes the basic division between personae, res and actiones in modern law is related to this basic development in Roman law.  (14) 

Original meanig of persona?  Latin etymologists say persona -- is per/sonare ""the mask through which (per) resounds the voice (of the actor)""...but he htinks this is a ""derivation invented afterwards."" (14)  He roots it in the Etruscans who had many many masks, has a mask civilizaiton in fact.  (15) 

But the Romans gave the word the meaning.  They had the same ""institutions of the same kind as ceremonies of clans, masks, and paints with which the actors bedeck themselves according to the names they bear."" (15)  He points to the Hirpi Sorani, the wolves of Soracte, which is connected to the founding myth of the Roman She-Wolf and the Romulus and Remus.  (15)  

He says that the Latins, Etruscans, and Amnites, all stil lived in an ""an environment [in which one moved] from <i>personae</i>, masks and names, and individual rights to ritual and privileges."" (16)  From this he says one single step took to move to the 'person' (personne) --> for the plebs to get the right to full citizenship so that ""All freemen of Rome were Roman citizens, all had a civile persona; some became religious <i>personae</i>; some masks, names and ritual remained attached to some privileged famlies of religious <i>collegia</i>"" (16) Along with this roman citizens had a right to forenames, surnames an dpseudonyms.  (16)  

He tracks the developmen then in Roman law of the notion of the ""persona"" as ""synonymous with the true nature of the individual."" (17) -- but before it was this it was also associated with ""an artificial 'character' (<i>personaage</i), the mask and the role of comoedy and tragedy, of trickery an dhypocrisy -- a strangeer to the 'self' (moi)... "" (17)   So the laaw stablished this ""right to the <i>persona</i>"" (17) and only slaves were excluded.  (17)"
The Theory of Professions: State of the Art,"00 Summary Note 00

In the simplest sense, Freidson is joining the ranks of those that are going against the Parsonian definition of the professions as ""honoured servants of  public need.""  (E.g. see Parsons' ""The Professions and the Social STructure"")  Freidson's ideas is actually
that one has to go beyond the notion of the profession by understanding that it is a historically rooted concept.  For instance, he suggests that it is a particularly anglo-saxon construct, or at least that it has a particular meaning in that context, connected to the fact that in England and the United States as opposed to Europe ""each occupation [tended] to have to mount its own movement for recognition and protection. Its members loyalties and identities were attached to their indivdiual occupation and its institutions.""  (24-25)  In Europe, the state was more active. (25)  Thus he argues that in the Aglo-Americna context the professions gain distinction ""less from the prestige of the institutions in which they were educated than from their training and identity as particular, corporately-organised occupations to which specializsed knowledge, ethicality and importance to society are imputed, and for which privilege is claimed."" ""(25)   Thus he thinks it is true that ""professionalism"" is the ""British disease"" or Anglo-American disease as he prefers. (25-26).  He adds, however, that this is not to say that the idea that profession is a ""folk concept"" is satisfactory, because the work of sociologists in defining professions is part of the definition that takes hold and helps to set the standards that professionals themselves attempt to meet.  (27-31)  What he wants to do then is develop a 
theory of occupations, within which ""professions"" can fit.  (32)"

"Creating a Female Dominion in American Reform, 1890-1935","0 p.xiii-xiv Female Dominion and Work on Women's Experience of Professions

The literature on women's professional experience she notes has observed that women faced a paradox: ""Prescriptions for female behavior directly contradicted the solidifying requirements of professional conduct: lingering nineteenth-century feminine ideals urged women toward passivity , humility, and self-sacrifice, while professionalism demanded activity, confidence, and self-assertion.  By validating behaviors traditionally associated iwth men, professionalization put aspiring women into perpetual conflict.  If they donned the behavioral garb appropriate to professional life, they invited criticism for being unfeminine.  If they refused to wear the suit, they lost the aura of professional authority."" (xiii)

She notes then that there were different experiences for women in the professions depending on whether they entered male-dominated or female-dominated professions, allso something established by the literature.  (xiii)  

Her female dominion is a study of ""female professionalism."" (xiv)  in which women had more freedom than in the male-dominated professions.  Specifically they were freer to ""reconcile professional ideals with values from female culture, which produced uniquely female ways of being professional."" (xiv)"
The Oversocialized Conception of Man,"<p>Notes on ""2. The Oversocialized Conception of Man in Modern Sociology"" (8/17/10):</p>
<p>(Note this is a reprinting of Wrong's famous and influential article published with the same name in 1961 in the American Sociological Review)</p>
<p>-- In his introductionary comments, Wrong indicates his belief that sociology should be built up around tangible ""questions"" (he doesn't like the phrase problems b/c it is too reformist).  He dislikes what he describes as a general tendency to develop sociological theory ""as the creation of a formal body of knowledge satisfying the logical criteria of scientific theory set up by philosophers and methodologists of natural science."" (32)  What he prefers isthe approach of the ""historicist conception of sociological knowledge"" (32) tha is represnted by Weber, Barrington Moor, Jr., C. Wright Mills (who he says in the forewardto this 1999  ed. book was his teacher).</p>
<p>-- The point here is not to get at laws of development he is careful to point out, but instead how and why can humans form socieities.  He sees these as existential questions on the one hand and questions stemming from Hobbes' basic question--""how men are capable of regulation by social norms and goals that make possible an enduring society"" (33)--on the other. The Marxist form of this same question focuses instead on how how ""complex societies manage to control and restrain destructive conflicts between social groups."" (33)</p>
<p>-- His opinion is that <strong>""[m]uch of our theory offers an oversocialized view of man in answering the Hobbesian question and overintegrated view of society in answering the Marxist question."" </strong>(33) This view he says has been challenged by several writers who he lists in f.n. #3.</p>
<p>-- He starts his critique with T. Parsons who he credits with acknowledging Hobbes as the first to answer the basic question which  Parsons describes as the ""problem of order"" in his first book, <em>The STructure of Social Action. </em>(33)  Then he states Hobbes construction of the problem (33-34).</p>
<p>-- Modern sociology he says gives two main answers to Hobbes' problem that together ""constitute a model of human nature, sometimes clearly stated, more often implicit in accepted concepts,t hat pervades modern sociology."" (35)  #1: the idea of ""internalization of social norms""; #2: ""the view that man is essentially motivated by the desire to achieve a postiive image of self by winning acceptance or status in the eyes of others."" (35)  He gives the following quote as an excellent example of hwat he describes as ""probably the most influential contemporary sociological conception--and dismissal--of the Hobbesian problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To a modern sociologist imbued with the conception that action follows institutionalized patterns, opposition of individual and common interests has only a very limited relevance or is thoroughly unsound. (35, from Francis X. Sutton, <em>The American Business Creed</em>, Cambridge U. Press, 1956, p.304)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His distase for this argument is that it totally erases the original Hobbesian question or ""destroys the awareness of rival possibiltiies suggested by the question which accounts for it having been asked in the first place."" (35)  It sets up the reverse question, in fact, which is ""How it is that vioelnce, conflict, revolution, and the individual's sense of coercion by society manage to exist at all, if this view is correct?"" (35) This ways of phrasing things reveals a dialetic but rejects any awareness of it.</p>
<p>-- W shows how Parsons develops this model by his assimilation of Durkheim, wherein he empahsizes Durkheim's alter finding that society's don't so much regulate as ""they enter directly into the constitutions of the actors' ends in themselves."" (36)  So from this Parsons develops his conception of social norms as ""constitutive"" (36).  W notes that the original idea of ""internalization"" that Parsons sets up may well have come from Freud, but emphasizes something totally apart from what Freud did.  His analysis of freud here is interesting, p.36-37.  Freud's view is that when a norm has been internalized it means ""no more than that a person will suffer guilt feelings if he fails to live up to it, not that he will in fact live up to it in his behavior."" (36)  The person who does conform might in fact be ven more racked with guilt...  He note discussion of deviance as getting closer to what Freud thought on bottomof 37.  ""The main explantory fucntion ofthe ocncept [of the superego] is to show how people repress themselves, imposing checks on their own desires and thus <strong>turning their inner life into a battlefield of conflicting motives, not matter which side 'wins' by dictating overt action</strong>."" (37)  So the psychoanalytica view W says is less ""deterministic"" than the sociological because it is focused on the inner life and not on ""overt behavior."" (37)</p>
<p><em>[Note: this would seem to relate to some of my analysis in both chs.3&amp;4.  This idea of internalization is what I have Sapir hitting on when he says that the goals of cutlure became ""what the individaul wants"" in his more cosnervatie turn  in ch.3.  Similarly, the classificatory discssuion of pschiatric and sociological coneptions of personality used in both chs, plus Mead and Benedict's discussions of deviance, and Benedict's idea of then ""normal deviant,"" plus just in geneal my sense of the relationship of Freud to what they were doing, which from this seems as though it could be drastically enahcned, but I'd need to dip deeper into Freud and also the personality and culture school...]</em></p>
<p>-- What sociologists have done W notes is to separate the superego from any id concept.  If people are well socialized,then there is no Hobbesian problem at all he says.  And they treat deviant behavior as a consequence of ""special circumstances: ambiguous norms, anomie, role conflict, or greater cultural stress on goals than on the approved means ofor attaining them."" (38)  They have also, he says, rejected the idea that there coudl be a variety of ""motives"" for conformity.  ""Either someone ihas internalized the norm, or he is 'unsocialized,' a feral or socially isolated child, or a psychoapth."" (38)  Freud by contast realied that some people hadn't formed superegos because and therefore could perform ""bad deeds"" without guilt as long as they were sure they wouldn't be punished. (38)</p>
<p>-- Now he begins a more detailed critique of contemporary sociological developments.  He has an intersting analysis of Reisman, who criticized oversocialized man, but without recognizing that thse types were conceptions rooted in his own profession, and not in fact actual types of human character.  But boht he and Guffman appareantly noted that Riesman's idea of human nature was closer to Freud's thna Parsons' in that ""character is defined by superego mechanisms and, like Freud in <em>Civilization and Its Discontents</em>, the socialized individual is defined by what is fobeidden him rather than what society stimulates him to do...[so that] implicit in his typology is a view of society as the enemy both of individuality and of basic drive gratification, a view that contrasts with the at least poentially benign role assigned it by neo-Freudian thinkers oike Fromm and Horney."" (40)  <em>[Note: This analysis I think fits with what Mead was hinting at in her review of Reisman and Whyte's book.</em>]</p>
<p>-- He then moves on to othe rlesser-known contemporary sociologists, Hans Zetterberg and RAlf DDahrendorm, where he finds oversocialization acknowledged as a conceptual proposition, not true, but rather in the manner of the abstract idea of <em>homo economicus</em> in economics, an abstractiont that if taken seriously offers up powerful tools.  But here W objecst that sociology was partly born out of a respond in his undersanding to the oversimpliified and exagerated assumptions of nineteenth century theorists, 41-42.  W likes better Veblen, who criticized classical economics.  (42, bottom).</p>
<p>-- He acknowledged the rising interest in man as ""role-player"" and similarly dislieks it as overly simplistic and a kind of ""ad-hoc"" sociology.  (43).</p>
<p>-- IN a way that is vaguely similar to Sklansky (though only vaguely) he notes that in this idea of internalized values, there has been a total rejection of ""material"" and ""sensual"" satisfication.  ""That material interests, sexual drives, and the quest for power have often been overestimated as human motives is not reason to deny their reality.  To do so its to suppress one term of the dialectic beteen conformity and rebellion, social norms and their violation, man and social order, as completely as th eother term is supressed by thos who deny the reality of an's 'normative orientation' or reduce it to the effect of coercion, rational calculation, or mechanical conditioning. ""(44)</p>
<p>-- What W wants is a recognition that ""in the beginning there is the body."" This is nto a return to biological essentialism he says but a recognition of its impact.  He quotes JOhn Dollard on the fact that Freud did not see the ""instincts as having a fixed social goal..."" (45)  [<em>Note: This Dolalrd quote may be good as a try to go back and tighten the relationship of Freud to my people...</em>]</p>
<p>-- For Freud W says ""man is a <em>social </em>animal without being entirely a <em>socialized </em>animal.  His social nature is itself the source of conflicts and antagonisms that create resistance to socailization by the norms of any of the socieites which have existed in the course of human history."" (45)</p>
<p>-- W ends the essay nicely...callling essentially for a more complex psychology in sociology..and recognizing the way contemporary sociology and humans in general seek to  covered over the violence that society does to the humans' ""drives"":  ""We must do better if we really wish to win credit outside of our ranks for special understanding of man, that plausible creature whose wagging tongue so often hides the despair and darkness in the heart.""

The Naturalized Female Intellect,"<p>p.214-216 Characterizing the female mind...</p>
<p>The earliest polemics against women focused on womens' moral qualities.  But Daston writes ""because moral and intellectual virtues overlapped in early modern philosophy, debates over women's moral soften widened willy-nilly into debates over their intellect as well."" (214)</p>
<p>Daston says that the ""<em>locus classicus</em> for sex differences in all species during this period remained a passage from Aristotle's <em>Historia animalum</em>..."" which she quotes at length on p.214-5.  She says that this passage ""reverberated through centuries, indeed millennia, of European debate about the differences between male and female.""  (215)  It set up a ""polar opposition between complementary male and female intellect"" that was not dissolved until the late nineteenth century (here she cites a 1989 paper of hers entitled: ""Weibliche Intelligenz: Geschicthe Einer Idee..."") The complementarity of thinking about male/female in Aristotle's though ""structured early modern views about sex differences, even with respect to moral injuctions purportedly binding on all Christians.  Thus to vioalte the passive virtues, chief among them chastity, was the cardinal sin for women but merely a pecadillo for men; conversely, timidity was the most easily excused fault in women and the least in men."" (215)</p>
<p>But besides this kind of polarity, there were also certain traits taht early-modern authors attributed to feminine intellect again drawing on Aristotle's claims in <em>Historia animalium</em>: <strong>""early modern philsopohers, jurists, theologians, and physicians generally agreed that women excelled in memory, ability to learn (where 'learning' was understood in the context of taming and therefore strongly assocaited with docility and pliability of character), cunning, and all aspects of mental mutability, including a quicksilver imagination and hair-trigger emotions.  Just as women were alleged to have less aptitude for the active virtues, such as courage, so they were also branded inferior to men in active intellect, including the exercise of speculative reason."" (216)</strong></p>
<p>These traits were ""corporeally grounded"" in ""women's allegedly cold, moist bodily complexion.  Sensory impressions, stamped upon the brain as a seal upon wax, therefore ahered more easily, distinctly, and durably in the soft, humed female matter thanin that of the hot, dry male.  Hence women excelled in memory and also in imagination, for the same complexion was linked to mutalbe mental impressions--as well as to levity, capriciousness, deception, and more intense passions.""

This was the case with Arendt's work and also a critique by Gehlen &nbsp;that was ""conservatively tinted"" and based on his own anthropological work. (39) also Habermas took an empirical account of basic human interests as e basis for his critique of the technologization of the social world in order to give it a ""universal foundation."" (39) The common thrust of these accounts was that the ""acceleration of industrial growth threatens a functionalrequirement of society that belongs to the most essential preconditions of all human life."" (39) &nbsp;but then from here Arendt, Gehlen, and Habermas draw different conclusions as to the specific social pathology produced. None of these accounts however refer to an originally state of humanity. He thinks they must have been shocked and challenged by Foucault's form of social philosophy that like Nietzsche's focused on power and expressed a distaste for universalism. (39)</span></p>

And this ultimately poses a problem to social philospohy as H has traced it in the article: ""if, in accordance with its theoretical aim, social philosophy is dependent upon universal criteria whose validity can no longer be indirectly proven by a presupossed anthropology, then its continued existence is wholly contingent upon whether a formal ethics can be justified or not...The future of social philosophy today consequently depends on the possibility of giving a convincing justification of our ethical judgements concerning the necessary requirements of a good and well-lived human life.""

Coming otu of Habermas this is the idea that one should view the problem of answering ethical questions as a ""task of practical discourses..."" i.e. as in law/justice. (41) This is a model the relies on the finding of consensus inside democratically organized contexts. 2) A second possiblity also laid out by Habermas in this Theory of Communicative Action is to use a striped-down anthropology--a ""merely formal anthropology"" not anchored in ""universal pragmatics""--in order to establish a ""critical threshold"" for claims of social pathology. In Habermas' work just mentioned that has to do with establishing a point behyond which the ""penetration of social systemtic imperatives into the social life-world must be regard as a social pathology."" (41) Other examples can be found in Martha Nussbaum's writings&nbsp; such as ""human Actiuon and Social Justice"" etc... see f.n. 70, and in Charles Taylor's wwork, esp. The Ethics of Authenticity and the Sources of the Self. 3) The third option which also comes out of an other approach laid out by Taylor (other than the #2 formal anthropology that is sparse) is a ""historically relativized jsutification of ethics."" (42) This involves a ""hermeneutic reflection on the ethical values guiding modernity's understanding of itself...[that might lead to a ] insight into which social developmans are to be regarded as social pathologies."" (42)&nbsp; This approach he notes is most consistent with Foucault's intentions. </span></p>

"Friedrich Albert Lange on Neo-Kantianism, Socialist Darwinism, and a Psychology Without a Soul","<p>General Notes 10/2012</p>
<p>#Thomas Teo, ""Friedrich Albert Lange on Neo-Kantianism, Socialist Darwinism, and a Psychology Without a Soul"" <em>Journal of History of the Behavioral Sciences,</em> v. 38, no.3 (Summer 2002): 285-301.</p>
<p>* Lange's bio: He was born 1828 and died 1875. Received his doctorate in phi8losphy in 1851 and finished his Habilitation in 1855 in philosophy and pedagogy at U. Bonn. He was active in the labor movement and was ""reprimanded"" for publishing pro-labor ideas in 1866, whereupon he moved to Switzerland. He bcame professor at the Univ. of Zuerich in 1870. He then reisgned during the Franco-German war due to the pro-French sympathies of the Swiss. He then returned to Germany and took a professorship at Marburg, where he staid until his death.(285-286)</p>
<p>* He published his most famous work, <em>The History of Materialism and Criticsim of its Present Importance</em> in 1866. It was translated into English and introduced by Bertrand Russell who called it a ""monumental work of the highest value"" (286) This was primarily a philosophical text but also did lay out his notion of ""psychology without a soul"" in the third section entitled <em>Man and the Soul</em>. He challenged ""philosphical psychology"" (metaphysics?) and tried to offer an alternative framework. Teo argues taht he had ""outlined a program for an objective psychology nearly half a century before John B. Watson"" and this was something that for exampl eTitchener (1914) acknowleded about Waton's point of view. (286) G. Stanley Hall also knew Lange's work and so did J.M. Baldwin.</p>
<p><strong>* Teo argues that Lange's ""programmatic ideas"" ""ammalgamated"" ""some of the most important worldviews of the ninteenth century..."" (287) They were hesays ""a sophisticated combiantion of Kantianism, Darwinism, and socialism"" each of which helpd form waht Teo describres as his ""antiphilosphical natural scientific pscyhology."" (287) </strong></p>
<p>* The first section of the article links Lange with Neo-Kantianism and the idea of psycho-physiological foundations. He starts with a description of Neo-Kantianism, which was he says an ""enormously influential and yet divided intellectual movmeent of the ninteenth century"". He cites a book by Koehnke (1991) called <em>The Rise of Neo-Kantianism</em>. He says it incouded a variety of exponents: ""from natural scientists such as Hermann Helmholtz (1821-1894) or Ernst Mach (1838-1916) to cutlural scientist such as Wilhelm Windelband (1848-1915) or Wilhelm Dilthey (1833-1911). He suggests that the movement was ar esponse to ""the fact that philosophers struggling with traditional philosophical topics required a firmer standing than what was provided by the speculative reasoning of Hegel's absolute idealism and systematic philosophical science."" (287)</p>
<p>[But didn't Mach reject the subject/object distinction that was important for Kant!! Hacohen for example describes Mach as doing that in his bioraphy of Popper, p. 56.]</p>
<p>* Lange, he says, was the ""father"" of the Marbrug school of neo-Kantianism, which was generally very influential. Lange's successor at Marburg was Herman Cohen (1842-1918) ""who outlined a philosphical justiifcation for Immanuel Kant's transcendental program..."" in his <em>Kants Theorie der Erfahrung</em> (1871). Also Paul Natorp who published introdcutory works to neo-Kantianism and provided a specific interpreation of Plato. This ""school"" came to end when its ""leading member"" Ernst Casirer lost his professorship in 1933 and emigrated to the United States.</p>
<p>* Lange was among a grup of early neo-Kantians who ""introduced a psycho-physiological foundatino for Kant's epistemology."" (288) The idea here was that they believed that Kant's idea that came from his <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em> ""suggested that human knowledge does not mirror external objects and events but that external events are modeled according to the human mind..."", i.e. that ""<em>things-in-themselves</em> are essentially unknowable butthat the human mind can nknow and under thier lawfull appearances""--they belived that this could be verified by scienc. E.g. physiologist Johnesses Mueller (1801-1858) ""formulated that the mindis not cognizatn of objects and events inthe external world but of states of the nervous system."" (288)</p>
<p>* Lange drew on Mueller but more on hermann Helmholtz. In 1855, Helmholtz gave a talk ""on visual perception in Koenigsberg, where he provided a physiolgoical interpreation of Kant's theory fo knowledge."" (288) Helmholtz concluded that kant's ideas were ""still alive"" and he denied that there was a difference between philosophy and natural science, ie that that difference only existed if one viewed philosophy as rooted in metaphysics, ie in the kinds of systems that were assocaited with Hegel and SChelling. (288) The essay was ""On Human Visison"" PUBLISHED IN (1903) IN <em>Vortraege und Reden: Erster Band, </em>pp.81-117.</p>
<p>* Lange believed that Helmholtz's research on the physiology of senses and perception refuted ""spistemological materialism and supported a Kantian inspired epistemology."" (288) But that epistemology did not rest on kant's intutiion and teh categories, but on the physiological mind that determines what people know. He wrote in 1887 that the ""qualities that we perceive do not belong to the things but to our own organization..."" (quoted on 288). He did not go so far as to doubt external reality or draw the conclusion that reality did not conform to natural laws. ""The senses give us, as Helmholtz says, <em>effects</em> of things, not true picture nor things in themseles."" (quoted on 288).</p>
<p>&gt; What is the Body? What is Matter? What is the Physical? And modern physiology, just as much as philosophy, must answer that they are all only our ideas: necessary ideas, ideas resulting according to natural laws, but still never the things themselves."" (Quoted on 289, from <em>History of Materialism</em>)</p>
<p>* There are then three more sections in this article. One deals with his critiques of other psychologists--the point here being mostly that he suspects various thinkers--especially phrenologists--as being seduced by a kind of metaphyics, whathe calls in a quote on p. 290 a ""metaphysical whirlpool, which in our country at that time mastered even him wh ostruggled against it..."" (290) He liked Wundt and Fechner a bit more.</p>
<p>* He himself put forward a notion of a ""psychology without a soul"" that Teo describes from 291-294. It's here that Lange is contributing to a push toward what Teo&nbsp; earlier called an ""objective psychology"" -- or somethign moving toward Watson's behaviroims. Lange was here militating against the psychologicalmethod of using ""introspection"" -- and one can see here too the hostility to metaphyics. He advocatedinstead the ""observation of others"" (and I wondered here if Boas might have moved from this to his participant observation). (292). And he thought that human psychology could draw much from animal pscyhology. (293).</p>
<p>* Finally, in the last two section Teo looks at Lange's response to Darwin. He liked Darwina nd thought it would produce interesting lines of psychological research. He accepted that humans had devleoped from animal origins. And he accepted notions of race, and even higher and lower civilizations, but he was opposed to readings of race and darwin that justified European colonialism. He also didn't believe that competition for resources defined human existince. He believed that humans at some poitn --and this sounds like Kroeber -- suspended the laws of selection that Darwin described. So there was bascially here the kernel of a kind of progressive and socialist reading of Darwin that Lange and according to a study by Weingart, Kroll, and Bayertz (1988) was developed&nbsp; in the 1860s...

Narratives of enlightenment: cosmopolitan history from Voltaire to Gibbon,"<p>Notes Feb 2011:</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>* The work examines five 18th century historians whose goal O'Brien says was to ""tranform their reader's sense of national self-awareness through the writing of narrative history."" The historians are Voltaire, David Hume, Gibbon, often grouped together she says; and then also William Robertson, a Scottish hsitorian of Scotland, and David Ramsay, a skeptical patriot hsitorian of the Am. Revoluition. (1)</p>
<p>* Her argument does not present a teleological examination of the rise of ""an Enlightenment meta-narrative of progress.""&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; And it is not a study of ""authorial influence.""&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; What she wants to do she says is examine ""the play of a cosmopolitan sensibility in each of these works across the political certainties, cultural self-understandings and national prejudices which structured contemporary readings of the past.""&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* The cosmopotitan sensibility that these authors shared she says represented a ""cosmopolitan (rather than universalist) recognition that all nations are endowed with valid histories and identities which intersect with, and complete, each other, but that individual states or nations are not, in themselves, intelligible units of historical study."" (1-2).&nbsp; All of the authors she says were commited to ""an ideal of Europe as a harmonious system of balancing states."" (2)</p>
<p>* She thinks (but is she right in 1997) that the term cosmopolitanism has gone out of favor among intellectual historians because ""as an idea, it seems to lack intellectual content; as a category of political thought, it has no referent."" (2)&nbsp; She says that Schlereth's <em>The Cosmpolitan Ideal in Enlightenment Thought </em>(1977) was the last examination of the idea.&nbsp; (But where is the engagement with all the new writing on cosmopoltianism in the 1990s???)</p>
<p>*&nbsp; She says she is ""reviving"" the term because of ""it simultaneously encapsulates an attitude of detachment towards national prejudice..., and an intellectual investment in the idea of a common European civilisation."" (2)&nbsp; (But why is this interesting???&nbsp; Does seh see this useful vv the EU projcet or what??)</p>
<p>* She says that her thinkers exhibit something like what Rorty taked about in refutation of Lyotard's accusation that cosmpolitanism containned the embedded wish for domination of the Europe, namely a ""cosmopolitanism without emancipation.""&nbsp; In the works of her writers, this involves a ""philosophically informed and politically principled skepticism twoards the grand narratives of their..."" (10)&nbsp; So rather than containing a teleology of European domination in history what she thinks her thinkers have in common is a ""descriptive model for the history of Europe through separately periodized, ancient, medieval, and dearelz modern and enlightened modern stages.""&nbsp; (10-11)&nbsp;</p>"

"""How Common Culture Shapes the Separate Lives"": Sexuality, Race, and Mid-Twentieth-Century Social Constructionist Thought","<p>Meyerwotiz examines what she sees as the ""conjuncture of race and sex in the culture-and-personality vision..."" (1058)  She puts this in a historiographical context--noting that there are two standard ""metanarratives"" of race and sex that ""disregard the significant overlap in the mid-twentieth-century intellectual histories or race and sexuality."" (1060)  The history of race tends to highlight the work of the Boasians; the examination of sexuality and specificially homosexuality tends to focus around the history of psychology.  The history of cultural relativism vis-a-vis race tends to have a ""liberal"" political valuence, empahsizing tolerance, but the history of pscyhology shows a different political valence--a tendnecy to see homosexuality as a kind of pathology.  Meyerowitz sees a lot more overlap and the culture-and-personality school is a nexus in which this occurred: Freudian thought was brought together with the cultural relativism of the Boasians.</p>
<p>Meyerowtiz then traces the tension between openness to sexual variation esp w/ regard to homosexuality in the work of Mead and Benedict, and then Otto Klineberg, Ashley Montagu, Abram Kardiner, and the looks at the resurrection of Bendict's ideas in the postwar era...   I</p>
<p>At the end, she has a section ""Rethinking the Histories or Race and Sexuality.""  She makes a good point here.. She asserts acccurately that if you look at the intellectual history of sexuality and race you see ""the ongoing tension between a cultural relativism that situated socially constructed difference primarily as variance and a concept of abnormality that situated socially constructed difference primarily as pathology."" (1083)  Then of course she restates her point that the histories of race and sexaulity are not separate.  ""The culture-and-personality scholars used Freudian psychoanalysis to understand race as well as sex, and they used Boasian relativism to understand sex as well as race."" (1083)  Then also she thinks this helps to see how social constructivism helped generate new ""regimes for managing populations.""  Continuining, she say:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">The now-standard histories of race and seuxality in the mid-twentieth-century United States suggest that social scientists promoted racial integration and intergroup cooperation (whcih some of them indeed did).  But the history of the cutlure-and-personality nexus highlights a larger biopolitical agenda.  The live-and-let-live, let's-be-tolerant message of cultural relativism came conjoined fromthe start with prescriptions for change at home and abroad.  Most of the culture-and-personality scholars called unabashedly for 'social engineering,' some of them reinscribed conventional boundaries dividing 'normal' from 'pathalogical,' and others turned toward a functionalist vision in which they repudiated biologism but nonetheless endorsed adjustement to the mainstream satus quo.  On issues of race, sexuality, and more, the culture-and-personality schlars often translated social and economic injustice into issues of mental health.  Most ambitiously they sometimes imagined the wholesale restructuring of the personalities, behavior, and traits of various groups, subgroups, communiteis, and nations. (1084)</p>
<p>Then she ends the artcile by suggesting that these ideas were put to practical use in multiple domain, which she lists... on 1084.</p>
<p>This article is good; it is pointing in exactly the right direction I think.  I brought together the histories of race and sexaulity in my last chapter, but I did so in order to draw out a more specific model of selfhood and liberal agency in Mead and Benedcit's thought.  My analysis is more complex but lacks the historiographical awareness that Meyerowitz has laid out here and which is excellent.  Her point that there was this tension between the impulse to reimpose conventional boudnaries and the openning up implied by cultural relativism is apt and it is borne out in my analysis of Sapir in particular...if not also Mead...</p>
<p>Does this article make the point I was making in ch.4 but better, or how woudl I position myself in realtion to the points Meyerowitz has made?  Well, for one I haven't really looked deeply into the culture-and-personality school in ch.4.  That is really about a moment that ocmes before, so the question would be what would I find if I look at the culture-and-personality stuff, keeping in mind the questions I have about the fate of the concern for individaul agency that I claim to exist in my dissertation up through the discussion of sexuality... One important point that this article raises is that I need to make a much bigger point of the profession's shift toward pscyhology in the late 20s early 30s.  See p.1061 where she describes this shift...esp re.  Sapir's articles... ACtually, she doesn't really describe it very thoroughly within the context of the proefssions' shifting focus...</p>
<p>The problem w/ Meyerowitz article is that her definitions of the political alternatives on either side is a bit shallow.  The liberalism of cultural relativism is simply the ""live-and-let-live, let's-be-tolerant message of cultural relativism"" and on the other side it's just ""adjustment to the mainstream status quo.""  (1083-4)  I can provide a more rigorous definition of the political stakes here vis-a-vis the categories of selfhood and agency esp. if I define these categories well and tie them into modern liberal political theory...</p>

"Franz Boas, Geographer, and the Problem of Disciplinary Identity","Summarial Note:  

Koelsch's overall argument here is that Boas's dedication to geography in the Humboldtian-Ritterian tradition which he got from Theodore Fischer among others has been underestimated in asessing Boas's professional ""identity."" 

Koelsch's argument is that Boas turned to ethnography b/c he lost the battle to define ethnography in terms of ""his own German-derived, neo-Kantian 'cosmographical' reinterpretation of human geography"" to the physiographic approach of other geographers such as Davis.  Koelsch writes that ""Davis won the geography wars, but in so doing left Boas a clear field.  As he repackaged his background and recent research studies into a new human sicnece, Boas was both to draw on the German human geographic tradition and to profit from the fact that American geographers did not."" (19)

Koelsch's argument in convincing.  He gathers a lot of evidence from archives and from existing accounts, esp. by Cole, that suggests that boas' commitments to geogrpahy were stronger than has been previously noted.  But Koelsch does not really draw out within Boas' thinking and writing the tension between this empahsis on geography and the specific meaning of a turn toward anthropology/ethnography.  That part lies beyond his paper chronologically speaking, so he never really explains what then happened to Boas's cosmographic approach.  How for instance did this merge into Boas's diffusionism?"
"With science as his shield: Teaching race and culture in American public schools, 1900--1954","p. 003-4  On the way ""culture"" was translated into curriculum

""With the help of anthropological texts like <i>Races of Mankind</i>,
racial discourse in American schools underwent a paradigm shift 
during the brief span of the Second World War.  The most significant
part of this transformation was the introduction of the scientific concept of race, as delineated by anthropologists Franz Boas, into American teachers' everyday language.  This anthropological definition of human raqce not only narrowed the boundaries of who was identified as a racial minority, but also introduced a new concept--culture--to explain the diversity of human life on Earth.  However, as this dissertation shows, public  school teachers modified the anthropological concepts of race and culture as they translated these ideas into practice in American schools.  The results of this modification were themselves multifaceted and complex.  For exmaple, some teachers employed the anthropological definition of human race to challenge racism and social inequality in America, thereby creating some of the most critical antiracist pedagogy o f the twentieth century.  Unfortunately, this critical antiracist pedagogy was more the exceptoin than the rule.  Most teachers simply translated an essentialist understanding of human 'race' into a softer language of 'culture' that continued to stigmatize minority individuals according to the supposedly natural or inherent characteristics of their group.  Throughout this dissertation, I show how educators constructed culture as a foil to race that recase the most damaging aspects of early twentieth century racialisti thinking into a more acceptable, but equally reductionist, discourse of cultural diversity.""

Object Lessons and Ethnographic Displays: Museum Exhibitions and the Making of American Anthropology,"00 Summary Note

Jenkens basically critiques museum exhiition practices of US anthropologists, accusing both Boas' predecessors at the BAE and Boas of relying upon a form
of presentation that relied upon techniques of objectification and classification that acted as a subsitution for the object's original context.  His critique of Boas relies heavily upon a theoretical langauge that he takes from an essay but Eugenio Donato called ""The Museum's Furnace: Notes toward a Contetual REading of Bouvard and Pecuchet"".  and this critique is on pp. 168-170.  Intreestingly, Jenkens critique of the exhibitions of the Washington antropologists is rooted in a connection he sees between the emergence of bureaucratic hierarchies and the systematic way in which they attempted to organize materials. Jenkins notes that massive proliferation of natural history museum in the latter half of the ninteenth-century (244) Then he links these to professionalization: E.g.: 

""The late-nineteenth-century museum exhibition thus defined a new physical space devoted to display, a space in which objects, facts, and images could be arranged and rearranged into pattterns and classificatory shcemes and in which th epublic could be entertained and educated by means of the world's specimens....Although museum collections genreateda a new and increasingly cumbersome body of knowledge, they simultaneously genreated new experts to colect, interpret organize, and display that knowledge."" (248)

Then in a section on th emuseum practices of BAE anthropologsts (249-256) he really tries to give a sense of the systematizing and bureaucratic practices of the anthropologists, and more deeply to describe the homogenizing effects of their systematizing techniques as ""semiotic homogeneity"" i.e. allowing a wookd cut or lithograph to stand in for an object , say a Kachina doll.  Eveyrthing then reduced to the same size.  (see 254).  Notes also that Between 1894 and 1895 15,000 objects were catalogued and 650 labels prepared.  (255)  These homogenized object then to be presented behind the ""clearest of glass"".  249.   The purpose of these displays also was to provide a broady survey of evolutionary social processes see e.g. quote about Dorse on 249 and 256-7.  

When it ocmes to Boas, though, he asserts a continuum and not a break as Boas thought it was.  Boas emphasizes ""life-world"" models but Jenkins sees this as just another form of classification that asserts the object as a stand-in for a ""whole"" culture.  What's more Jenkins' notes that Boas wanted to subordinate objects to the extensive labels and texts that would accompany them.  ""By thus assigning priority to discursive langauge, to labels and texts, Boas was already caught up in a classificatory scheme which, as part of the emergence of late nineteenth-century collections world-wide, 'challenged the preminence of emotive, nonverbal forms of experiencing objects, as was the case with the wonder cabinets, and favored the more disciplinary langauges concerned with authenticity, connoisseurship, provenance and patronage that drew some closure on knowledge.'"" (267, he's quoteing an article by Carol Breckenridge on ""The Aesthetics and Politics of Colonial Collecting..."" here.)"

"A History of Philosophy in America, 1720-2000","<p>General Notes</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pt. 1 Speculative Thought in America, 1720-1868</p>
<p>* Three ""components"" of dialogue that was participated in by ""philosphers"" in America:</p>
<p>1) The parish ministers, esp. in New England, who dominated and were part of a conversation among religious elites in Scotland, England, and Germany.&nbsp; They were not connected to institutiosn of higher education, so he has ""sometimes"" called them ""amateurs."" (1)&nbsp; They exponded a variety of Calivinist Protestantism.&nbsp; Jonathan Edwards was key, but also Horace Bushnell and Ralph Waldo Emerson, though he and Bushnesll were opearting at ""a time whe such thinekrs were deserting their congregations and turning away from traditional Protestant doctrine."" (1)&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) The seminaries in the Northeast and the old Midwest and South.&nbsp; These were institutions training a professional ministry and unconnected to colleges.&nbsp; Key figures were Leoanrd Wood of Andover Theological Seminary, Henry Ware of Harvard Diviinity School, Nathaniel William Tay.or of the Yale Divinity School, Chalres Hodge of the Princeton Theological Seminary, and Edwards Amasa Park of Andover... (1) These theologians ""controlled the major power bases in the nineteenth century.&nbsp; They trained the ministers and determined much of what was published.&nbsp; Their outlook tended to be more narrow and sectarian than taht of those speculative thinkers who were not professors of diviningn..."" (2)</p>
<p>3) The ""philosphers"": these were men who held chairs in mental, moral, or intellectual philosophy at the American colleges of the ninteenth century, colleges which were """"small, sleepy institutions, peripheral to the life of the nation."" (2) These philosophers were also ministers and committed Protestants.&nbsp; ""but in addition to showing that reason was congruent with faith they also studied the grounds of the social order and politics, and commented on the affairs of the world.&nbsp; Their libraries were inadequate, their education mediocre, and the literary culture in which they lived sentimental and unsophisticated.""&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; They were men like Francis Bowen of Harvard, James McCosh of the College of New Jersey (Princeton), and NOah Porter of Yale.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. <strong>Calvinism and JOnathan Edwards</strong></p>
<p>* In the 17th century and into the 18th, ministers dominated<strong> </strong>New England and some of the New Hampshire towns.&nbsp; They followed the Calvinist ""federal"" or ""convenant"" theology.&nbsp; The idea behidn this theology was that God had created two convenants with humans: the first was that that Adam and Eve violated, and the second, represented by the coming of Christ, revelaed taht ""if individuals had faith in Jesus, they would be redeemed.&nbsp; God knew, the Calvinists argued, that people would continue to sin and would never merit salvation.&nbsp; They would never be obedient as they could have been before teh Fall, but they could recognize their wickedness,and could be saved by God's grace, his mercy or goodness.&nbsp; The central event in the Christian life was the gift of grace.&nbsp; by a supernatural act, God infused sinners with a consciousneess of his glory and love, and enabled tem to turn from the idolatry of self.&nbsp; Grace mysteriously transformed human selfishness and overwhelmed and humbled Christians."" (6)</p>
<p>* Within this tradition the American ""federal"" theology was a variant of the version of Calvinism as defined by the Dutch Synod of Dort (1618-1619).&nbsp; The synod defined the heresy of Arminianism, after Jacob Arminius: this was the idea that the sinner could respond to the giving of grace ""to do good or eviil as they chose."" (6) The synod declared that humans were depaved and could not merit salvation voluntarily.&nbsp; So they rejected the idea that the sinner could ""regulate grace."" (6)&nbsp; But, in New England, in America, the ministers emphasized that the dsinner had to ""prepare"" to receive grace--an issue that was ""entangled with issues of clerical authority and church membership."" (6)&nbsp; Kuklick briefly traces that discussion on 6-8. He sums it up: ""From the mid-eighteenth until the end of the nineteenth century the central issue for American thinkers was the connection of God's supremacy to human freedom.&nbsp; God did not author sin and was not to be blamed for the failure of the covenant of works.&nbsp; He was still almighty and causally sovereign.&nbsp; Although God gave faith and was to be praised for the covenant of Grace, people were answerable for their own salvation."" (8)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Then he introduces Jonathan Edwards who he says ""came of age in this speculative world."" (8) Edwareds born in 1703 in East Windsor Connecticut, son of&nbsp; an important minister and grandson on his mom's side of the revivalist preacher Soloman Stoddard.&nbsp; Edwards spent time at Yale College wehre a library acquired from Jeremiah Dummer, the Dummer Collection, contained important books of European 17th century thought that he absorbed including Newton, and Locke's <em>Essay concerning Human Understanding</em> (1690).</p>
<p>* Summarizing Locke v Descartes: Conventional idea is that Locke successfully challenged Descartes.&nbsp; Both were metaphysical dualists: ie believed in two sorts of substances: mind and matter.&nbsp; And both were ""representational realists"" ""form whom knowledge3 of material substances was mediated through the mind."" (9)&nbsp; But for Descartes there were certain innate ideas, whereas Locked believed that the mindlacked andy innate ability to ""cogitate, a priori, on the nature of things and could not arrive at truths about the world by itself.&nbsp; The mind for Locke was only the medium in which the momentarily given presented itself.&nbsp; Knowledge came from the immediate contents of the mind, called phneomena, experience, or discrete ideas."" (9)&nbsp; Locke, then, was an empiricist and urged ""Newtonian-like observations as the basis of knowledge,"" whereas Descartes the mind itself could serve as the basis of knowledge. (8-9)</p>
<p>* Locke's ideas ultimately have ultimately come to signify for us an anti-absolutist position.&nbsp; This was so for contextual reason and because of how Locke was read.&nbsp; Kuklick point to two interpretations by Bishop George Berkeley and David Hume.&nbsp; Berkeley argued against the idea of underlying matter or material substance by 1) arguign that Locke could not distinguish between primary and secondary qualities (ie between primary qualities like solidity and extension and secondary like taste and color) and 2) he modified Locke's notions of two sorts of ideas sensation and reflection, stating that sensations of the outer world were God's ideas that were imposed on humans and over which they had no control; they could only control reflections which were just weaker copies of God's ideas.&nbsp; The latter ""emanated"" from humans and were finite.&nbsp; Berekely thus became known as an ""idealist"" for his focus on minds and their contents, and his denial that sensation reflected an outside material wrold.&nbsp; On the flip side, David Hume aruge dthat all innate wideas, both human and divine, were illegitimate.&nbsp; ""he contrued the mind itself as a seires of ideas""&nbsp; cobbled together from the disjointed phonemana of experience. Ie ""Practical belief was based on subjective impressions and good only so far as we could comfortably act on it."" (10)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* <strong>But</strong> in the world of the 18th century Edwards would have encountered Locke's ideas in a discourse dominated by philosohpers in the Cartesian tradition and the writings of English ""idealists"" who were reacting to Locke and Descarte's dualism.&nbsp; Such thinkers were not blind to the developments of science but even Newton had suggested that ""physica described the immaterial structure of God's will working incessantly."" (10) <strong>Therefore the new science did not need to be read as ""implying materialism, uncertainty, or skpeticism but rather as asserting the primacy of midn."" (10)&nbsp; In this context, Kuklick argues, that Locke could be read as not comforting rationalists but many of his ideas could be ""controverted, redefined, or given a religious interpretatino."" (10)&nbsp; He was important to Edwards.</strong></p>
<p>* Indeed, Edwards built from Locke and anti-materialist philosophy.&nbsp; At first he accepted Locke's primary and secondary distinction.&nbsp; He found in Locke's belief that ""the primarcy qualities of matter inhered in the small, hard atomic particles of the Newtonian universe"", god.&nbsp; He conceived such particlesa s centers of energy that were an exertion of God's power.&nbsp; Edwards wrote: ""[T]he substance of bodies as last becoming either nothing, or nothing but the deity acting in that particular manner in those parts of space where he thinks fit.&nbsp; So that, speaking most strictly, there is no proper substance but God himself..."" (quoted on 11).&nbsp; So in the idea of ""solidity"" (what Locke saw as a primary quality in the material world) Edwards found an external world, outside the midn's of humans, which was a manifestation of God's power and will.&nbsp; At first, he accepted the dualist world and the represenational theory, seeing secondary qualities of things as existing only in the mind, but then he moved beyodn this position to argue that both existed outside the mind and were part of the structure of the world created by God's mind.&nbsp; People directly knew these qualities. (11-12)&nbsp; Unlike Berkeley, he treated reflective ideas not as ""finite"" or weak, but as simply fragments of god's ideas.&nbsp; (12)&nbsp; Thus essentially Edwards denied both dualisms: the dualism of Locke's between sensation and reflection, and the dualism of Berekeley between God's ideas and it's weaker finite versions in human ideas.&nbsp; He didn't reject the ""felt"" difference, but said that the difference was based on two ways of knowing ""One way was the world minds knew,; the other way was the minds knowing the world."" (13) ??&nbsp;</p>
<p>* In his sectionon Edward's book <em>Religious Affections</em>, Kuklick makes some of this more clear.&nbsp; In particular, he describes Edwards as an empiricist who beleived that experience coveyed the supernatural: e.g. an ""experimental Calvinist."" (18)&nbsp; Here too it becomes easier to understand, how Edwards thought connected to the New England Calvinist emphasis on preparation for grace and the way that Edwards handled dualism.&nbsp; In his account of how God gave grace, Edwards saw Grace as God allowing humans to have a new simple idea, ie a new way of knowing.&nbsp; (17)&nbsp; There was a degree of salvation available in reading the Bible.&nbsp; The Bible provided somethign like a ""notional"" knowledge of god's plan, but this was different than the more full, simple, and complete form of knowing that one attained after having received God's grace.&nbsp; Kuklick describes the difference as that between ""knowing that honey was sweet and actually experiiencing honey's sweet taste..."" (18)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Edward's notion of Freedom is laid out 21-24.&nbsp; Basically, Edward's says that humans have freedom, but that that freedom has no real efficacy.&nbsp; Volitional activity for Edwards was simply an impulse to act based on a momentary perception of the way the world was.&nbsp; He distinguished between extternal will and internal will.&nbsp; Human will never caused anything to happen in the world, only God's effcient will, which was part of the external world, did that.&nbsp; Sometimes, however, God linked internal human will/volition to external behavior.&nbsp; It was up to God, i other words, to connect the will with what followed.&nbsp; Kuklick explains: ""If one billiard ball hit as econd, the second moved away from the first.&nbsp; God established a regular order that licenced the inference that the first caused the movement of the second.&nbsp; But the only efficient cause was God's will in action, cause the second to move after it contacted the first."" (24)&nbsp; In relation to human morality, it could be said that a selfish will would sin, but that tthat was true, did not mean that a selfish will <em>would</em> sin; that was determined by God's efficient cause. Ie It was up to god to poruce ""a given wolitionon the occasion of a preceding volition."" (24)</p>
<p><strong>2. Philosophy and Politics</strong></p>
<p>* This chapter is an attempt to take stock of the relationship between philosophy and philosophers and political theory and political statesmen in U.S. history.&nbsp; Kuklick's claims are very broad (!) and I think problematic.&nbsp; His basic ideas is that there wasn't&nbsp; much of a relationship at all.&nbsp; So he says: ""The central point of this chapter is that whatever the substantive connection, the sensibility of the theologians of Edwards's lineage differed fundamentally from that of the politicians."" (27) And again a bit later: <strong>""</strong>The fact is that the scholar has to look for explicit theological, and sometimes even religious, ideas in the work of the Found Fathers and their political opponents, and has to look for distinctive Calvinist expressions of support for, or opposition to, the new politics.""&nbsp; Ie. the idea is that these two worlds were mostly separate (which I find hard to believe!).&nbsp; To support for example he points to the statement by Franklin at the General Congress in Philadelphia in 1787 where the Coinstituion was framed, which he has introduced as a high point in Enlightenment philosophizing from the point of view of natural rights philosophy, that the idea of starting each session with prayer was ruled out because ""The Convention, except for three or four persons, thought Prayers unnecessary."" (33)&nbsp; Similarly, he quotes John Addams, saying that no good ""effect"" could come of mixing the ""sacred character with that of the Statesman."" (quoted on 34).&nbsp; And also then his account of the theologians/philosophers tendency to establish a hierarchy of goals, onklty trying their hand at political problems when they'd solved general philsophical dabates (34-35).&nbsp;</p>
<p>* A key point of difference here was the way the statesmen, due to their enlightenment views, viewed the relationship of God to the world.&nbsp; They were Desists, they believed that God had made the world according to a certain design, and then had retreated.&nbsp; Unlike in the theology/philosophy of Edwards, where God was the sole and ongoing efficient cause in the world, the Deists did not think that God was involved in the world and what happened in it. (29-29)</p>
<p>* An interesting point of analysis here, however, is his brief summary of Benjamin Franklin's early <em>Dissertation on Liberty and Necessity, Pleasure and Pain</em>, which he notes deploys an argumentt about moral determination that has a similar structure to Edwards's, but which Franklin rejected entirely later in his life, finding that it did not account for his own moral feelings... (35-37).&nbsp;</p>
<p>* The broadest historiographical claim that Kuklick makes here is to say that this separation in philosophy and politics had a an enduring mark on philosophy generally in the United States, i.e. that American philosophy has always been marked by deep interest in mwetaphysics and priorities of ""speculative reason"" above political theory. He event says that Dewey, Marcuse, and Rorty exhibit this tendency!&nbsp; He describes these thinekrs as influenced by German organicism and begrudgingly admits that they have some ""claims"" to being seen as political theorists: ""Even in the political evaluations of those philosophers later guided by German organicism--the St Louis Hegelians, Josiah Royce, John Dewey, Herbert Marcuse, and Richard Rorty--the prorities of speculative reason were substantial, although this group had claims to be considered, in my usage, political theorists and not political philosophers."" (35)</p>
<p><strong>3. Theological Disputes</strong></p>
<p>*&nbsp; This chapter is dealing with disputes in theological/philosophical circles after Edwards' death.&nbsp; There was the ""New Divininity""--a body of thought developed by Joseph Bellamy, Samuel Hopkins, Nathaniel Emmons, Jonathan Edwards (the younger), and timothy Dwight that refined Edwards' theology.&nbsp; The New Divinity influenced liberal religious thought in Boston in the early 1800s, and this liberal thoguht overthrew the old Calvinism at Harvard in the early 1800s.&nbsp; Kuklick sketches the ""social context"" on 39-40.&nbsp; The new movement he summarizes on 40 arose int he aftermath of the Great Awakening as American Calvinism ""factionalized"".&nbsp; Liberals in Boston drifted away from the old Calvinism toward Unitarianism, causing controversy.&nbsp; But the main opposition to the New Divinity came from the ""Old Calvinists"" who were known for a lack of interest in theological doctrine, and thus had little interest in philosophy.&nbsp; They though tthe New Divinity elevated theory above ""strong orthodox community.""&nbsp; (41)&nbsp; This resistance achieved its greatest success in the Second Great Awakening.&nbsp; (40-41).</p>
<p><strong>4. Collegiate Philosophy, 1800-1868</strong></p>
<p>* This chapter is about the development of a philosophical tradition after the decline of the dominance of theology -- ie the development of philosophy as something independent from philosophy, as opposed to a tool used to resolve theological disputes (cf Edwards notion of the relationship between philosophy and theology...which was that theology proposed the design, and philosophy a way to resolve certain theological problems...Kuklick explains this somewhere in his section on Edwards...)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Philosophy as its own thing got it's start ""as the Princeton divines struggled to free themselves from New Divinity, and examined epistemology as means to support their ideas of religioius virtue."" (58)&nbsp; Here by the early 19th century, the growing number of colleges provided a venue for this development.&nbsp; To the old colleges in the east, there were added new colleges in the south and midwest.&nbsp; The first philosophy was written by professors whose primary goal was to provide ""their pupils&nbsp; with a moral sense of their place in the world."" (58)&nbsp; They attempted to do so in textbooks for their students and it is in these textbooks that philosophy as an indepednent thing had its start. (58).&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Meanwhile, the tehologians did not like writing textbooks; thus it was the ""[d]ivines and not the metaphysicians that wrote the scholarlly monographic literature in the nineteenth century."" (58).&nbsp; Essentially, at the American ""ivory towers"" the divines/theologians ""catered more and mroe to advanced ministerial students and said little to peple outside graduate classrooms."" (59)&nbsp; And they were more and more contemptous of the changes in European thought...thus gradually lost vigour. (59)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Ultimately then Philosophy was more recognizably ""modern"".&nbsp; -- dealing openly with Hegel and Mill...and not Calvin alone.&nbsp; So ""As colleges gradually claimed the guardianship of the character of the upper-class youth, seminaries became more elevated above, and thus isolated from, ordinary life.&nbsp; the college philosophers, frequently also the presidents of their institutions, gained recognition as intellectual spokesmen in their communities.&nbsp; These men inculcated into their pupils the domianavt values of the various local collegiate cultures. ...""</p>
<p>* Scottish philosophy of Thomas Reid and Duglad Steward was influential and processed in one set of textbooks that the philosphers produced.&nbsp; These textbooks abbreviated for their students the arguments contained with Thomas Reid's <em>Essay on the Intellectua...and Active Powers</em>, and Dugald Stewart's <em>Philosophy of the Human Mind</em> and <em>The Active Moral Powers</em>.&nbsp; The philosophers divided philosophical questions into two categories: intellectual or mental philosophy and moral philosophy.&nbsp; The former included epistemology, metaphysics, and logic; the latter included ethics and social science viewed normatively and dealt with the ""active"" faculties of emotions and the will.&nbsp; (60)&nbsp; In the first categorty is where Scottish realism came in.&nbsp; Reid and Stewart critiqued classicial empricism (see 8-9), arguing that the ""date of experience were not the ideas of classical empiricism but judgements accompanying sensations."" (60).&nbsp; The idea of this ""common sense"" realism of Stewart's was that our mind was so constituted that in ""sense perception"" our minds actually contacted the external world and provided real knowleddge of the world.&nbsp; Ie ""Sensation implied the qualities of objects; perception of the world accompanied sensory experience.""&nbsp; (60)&nbsp; American philosophers, Kuklick says, tied the Scottish realist view to a ""belief in Locke's greatness and the poverty of 'metaphysical' speculation."" (60) They thought that Locke's empiricism, use of an inductive method, and rliance on sensory evidencew as good, but critiqued his ""representational realism"" -- ie the idea that knowledge of the world is mediated by the mind, see 9, top.&nbsp; By restricting knowledge to the mind int his way, they thought (in some ways like Reid and Stewart) that Locke's thought led to either the ""idealism"" of Berkeley or the skepticism of Hume.&nbsp; Kuklick says the Americans read Locke as someone who meant to adopt presentationalism, i.e. presumably the idea that there can be direct unmediated knowledge of the world.&nbsp; They believed that the Scottish realists had corrected Locke and clarified the tradition of British empiricism.&nbsp; (60)&nbsp; In other words, for Locke sensations--like smell, color, etc--were in the mind in response of the nervous system to external sensory input (see p.8).&nbsp; For the Scottish realists, these qualities that were perceived were not solely in the mind; rather the mind perceived these qualities in the objects more or less accurately.&nbsp; Kuklick explains the American variants on this by Witherspoon, Levi Frisbie, and Francis Bown on 60-61.&nbsp;</p>
<p>* In addition to this ""presentational theory of knowledge,"" the Americans also developed a theory of science based in the scientific thought of Francis Bacon.&nbsp; Before the dominance of Edwards' thought had allowed ""theorizing to dominate science,"" but now the idea of learning about the world through careful observation and carefully forming laws became dominant.&nbsp; But these laws ony sought to explain the observed.&nbsp; ie science int his way ""codified ordinary experience. (62)&nbsp; This science could provide an argument for God: ie the existence of design in the observed world. So Baconian scientists believed that science led to religious understanding. (62)lt</p>
<p>* Then in the 19th century also, Kuklick says it was ""understood"" that empiricism had led to skepticism (ie not in the Us but elsewhere).&nbsp; This is where Kant comes in.&nbsp; He tried to settle ""competing claims about knowledge intended to secure knowledge in the world of experience but simultaneously to avoid dogmatism about any supra-experiential realm."" (62)&nbsp; Kuklick summarizes his argument on 62-63.&nbsp;</p>
<p>* He then explains that Kant and the Scottish realists had something in common, namely their critique of Hume's skepticism (and nihilism).&nbsp; For this link see 64.&nbsp;</p>
<p>* By the 1830s, Kuklick says ""German thought"" ie metaphysical thought was making inroads into the United States.&nbsp; So then it also becomes important to emphaszie that there were disagreements between Kant and the Scottish realists, despite their shared distaste for Humean skepticism.&nbsp; The Scottish realists believed that what Kant called the noumenal world of things in themselves could be known, but for Kant the answer was no.&nbsp; Hamilton adjuticated this quarrel Kuklick says ont he British side and was influential in the US.&nbsp; He fused Kant and Locke in a way.&nbsp; (64-65).&nbsp; Through Hamilton, moroever, the Americans philosphers essentially began to shift toward metaphysics, to lose their certainty about the real world. Kuklick explains this on 65-72.&nbsp; One example, that relied on the thought of Hamilton is the thought of Yale Porter at Harvard that Kuklick explains on 66-67.&nbsp; Then also the American philosophers move also beyond Hamilton.&nbsp; By 1840s, Kiklick says they begin to accept Kant's transcendental ideas but without noting the limits that Kant had placed on thought.&nbsp; (70).&nbsp; The argumenta bout this tendency is key to Kuklick's larger point that American philosophers have been heavily influenced by metaphysics coming from Germany.&nbsp; But he qualifiees the claim in an interesting way when he says: ""The Americans were not extravagantly metaphysical.&nbsp; Scottish realism protected them from skepticism and allowed them to enter the world of spirit.""&nbsp; He points out that as the challenges of materialism increased, the philosophers turned toward metaphysics, drawing on Hamilton's putting of ""matter beyond deity.""&nbsp; (72)&nbsp; But they were not willing, he says, to ""embrace another metaphysics"" and defend it. (72)&nbsp; He uses Porter again to say that he insisted that the univer ""was thoe thought of an individual thinker, fraught with design and including the originaation of forces (matter) and their laws.""&nbsp; (72)&nbsp; <strong>Thus he ""stumbled into absolute idealism"" and also ""pressed Scottish thought to its limits."" (72)&nbsp; Kuklikc says that he's a key example of the ""growing discomfort among academic philosophers with the ability of realism to reconcile science and theology."" (72) </strong></p>
<p><br /><strong>5.&nbsp; Innovative Amateurs, 1829-1867<br /></strong></p>
<p>* Kuklick argues that the really creative thought ""that would preserve nineteenth-century speculation"" was done by what he calls ""amateurs"" people ""at the periphery of the educational system."" (75) These thinkers, K says, searched for a vision of the world ""less constricted"" than what the philosophers and theologians were developing.&nbsp; He traces five of their strategies: James Marsh, President of Univ. of Vermont's use of Kant to ground a new ""philosophy of religion"" that would push ""New England Theology"" in a lesss ""intellectualist"" direction; Emerson's Transcendetnalism; Horace Bushnell's (Connecticut) grappling with German ideas in a way that moved twoard Hegel; John Williamson Nevein's appropriation of Hegel in Mercesrsburg, in a German reformed seminary in W. Pennsylvania; and finally a group of Hegelians in St. Louis.&nbsp; (75)</p>
<p>(Not taking as detailed notes here... for the moment)</p>
<p>* Summing up the relationship of the different strategies on 82, K writes: ""March applied German speculation to American theology.&nbsp; Emerson and his followers concentrated on the distinction between nature and spirit and the symbolic aspect of spiritual language.&nbsp; This focus, along with Emerson's disdain for systematic thought, led him, unlike Marsh, to chart a new career as an American man of letters....""&nbsp; (82)&nbsp; This difference meant that ultimately Emerson transcendentalism came to be dominant mostly in academic literary life and also was convincing in ways that Marsh's reasoning wasn't.&nbsp; Kuklick says that in philosophy of religion, Trascendentalism ""contributed to a new avant-garde culture in which relgigion was a matter of symbol and feeling."" (82)&nbsp; But the ideas did not penetrate so much into the ""instituationalized"" philosophical and theological discussion. (82)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Bushnell's thought K says worked more closely with language vv the idea that he felt that there was a split between nature and spirit, see 84 on the split and 85 on the piont about language.&nbsp;</p>
<p>* K says that eventually in the middle third of the nineteenth century, the thought of these ""amateurs"" ""slowly impressed thinkers in the colleges and seminaries."" (94)&nbsp; German ideas thus slowly gained credibility after the Civil War.&nbsp; They were also significant because they carved out careers outside of the academies, but that success was short-lived and swept aside after the Civil War.

History: Professional Scholarship in America,"p.016 - Professionals Take Control

After H. Baxter Adams professional move to take control of the AHA.  Began in form of rebellsion of group of professors in 1895  who thought the meeting was dull and Washington not an adequate location or center of literary and academic life.  What htey got was a ""new policy of rotation that would bring the Association each year to one of the major university communities."" (16) 

American Historical Review foundedinitially as an indepdnedent paper , strictly professional. by several ivy league professors.  And J. Franklin Jameson as its managing editor.  In 1915 AHA took formal control after Bancroft and some other accused the editors of fraud and favoritism.  (16-17)

New leadership after 1895 also realized that they coul dnot rely upon the government for support.  AHA appointd its own Historical Manuscripts Commission.  . Alsof formed a Public Archives Commission in 1899.  Did not ignore amateurs, welcomed mebership from anyone interested. Not always a great deal of cooperation between professionals and amateurs but in some cases yes, as in formation of the Mississippi Vally Historicl Ass.  a produced of collaobraiton of proffessional histoirans and state-supported historical agencies. (18-19) 

AHA had also by 1899 gained control of historical instruction below the collegiate level.  The AHA's committe of Seven proposed sweeping revision in 1899, ""called for a four-year history requirement in the college preparatory program, encompassing ancient history, medieval and modern Europe, English history, and American history."" (19) 

1907 end of an epoch Higham says: 26 volume ""american Nation Series"" published between 1904 and 1907. It represnted the """"the first great professional synthesis of American history."" (20) 

By and large, the AHA stopped choosing patricians as presidents.  Only occasionally (20) . John Franklin Jameson the first professional president. (20)"
"With science as his shield: Teaching race and culture in American public schools, 1900--1954","p.007  Timeline

Covers 50-year period.  Initial context is the attempt to ""Americanize""
newcomers, which involved speaking of ""'racial' gits and deficits of vairous
European ethnic, national, and religious groups."" (5)   Rise of Nazi Germany in
the 1930s provoked shift toward focusing on ""the 'cultural' gifts of various 'racial' groups--again typically white ethnics."" (5)  Question is at this point raised about how to fight racial prejudcie (5). War in 1939 provokes need to get rid of white racism.  ""In fact, for many educators snuffing out racial discrimination was equated with forging national unity."" (5)  At this point anthropologists and other socia-scientists enter debate in the 1940s.  they succeed in forcing a shift in how teachers ""taught about theconcept of race itself..."" (5) The result she says is that teacehrs ""stopped refering to white ethnics as 'racial' minorities and reserved the term--and its destructive imploications--for people of African and Asian descent (including Native Americans)."" (6)  By 1948, antiracist education is receding.  Here she tries to offer a new analysis -- where others attribute thes hift to the Rise of the ColdWar.  She thinks instead that it was due to the confusion of teachers, faced with ""competing versions of tolerance and pedagogy and disillusion by sustaianed evidence of racism in the classroom.""

A Social History of Anthropology in the United States,"p.072 Post-WWI Private Initiatives Shape Research 

Patterson say sthree initiatives most important.  

1) The Rockefeller philanthropies, esp. the Social Science Research Council (founded 1923), the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial (LSRM) and the Rockefeller Foundation.  These focused on ""porlbem-oriented, interdisciplinary social science."" (72)  

2) The National Research Council's ""effor tto promote the study o fracial groups and race mixture in the United States."" (72)

3) The American Council of Learned Societie's Committee on Research in American Native Language funded by $80,000 grant from Carnegie Co. in 1927 aimed at a salvage operation of native languages.  (72) 

Sapir and ""to a lesser extent"" Boas were involved in all three Patterson ssays, see 72 bottom.  Sapir was the chair of the NRC's Division of Psych. and Anth. when the his SSRC proposals on acculturation and psychology o fculture (culture and personality) were accepted.  (72)

Patterson says Rockefeller phil. had greatest affect through building of U. Chicago (Sapir also involved b/c he was hired their)  (73)  Rock. phil. very interested in ""making the social sciences more sccientific in order to promote social and economic stability, to eliminate subjective studies of social phenomena, and to develop more effective methods of social control."" (73)  This interest led to Community studies first of which was Yankee City (73-74)

Meanwhile NRC prompted focus on race beginning in 1920 under direction of Clark Wissler as refelctedin a confidential report of that year.  And this came with dominance of Boas point of view on race.  But both biological and cultural determinism flourished under NRC initiative. (75). Herskovits did his work with NRC grant.

Another Liberalism: Romanticism and the Reconstruction of Liberal Thought,"<p>Random Note 1: Rosenblum's Discussion of Lliberalism and Feminism</p>
<p>Rosenblum thinks that liberalism is less likely to exclude women.  In a section where she describes liberal individualism as potentially including the same sort of ""extraordinary action"" implied by heroic individidualism, she then describes Liberal individualism as definitely not so focused on such herocism as Romanticism.  IN the process, she notes that it is also less ""masculine.""</p>
<p> </p>
<p>""...Liberal individualism does not always have this ethos of being for the strong, nor does it always have quite the same masculine aura."" (21)</p>
<p>She then also states that liberal indvidualism is more likely to grant rights to women as well as men: ""Although liberal individualism historically attributes rights and liberty to men, there is no conceptual barrier to extending them to women.  At least the obstacles to considering women as person are more likely to break down when independence means pursuit of happiness and not militarism.  Plainly, part of the attraction of romantic militarism is its elitism, at twhose heart is exclusion of women.  Women embody the mundane.  They are responsible for the breakfast odors and air of domesticity Chateaubriand despised."" (21)</p>
<p>Then later she continues this theme talking about the poet Vigny who had romanticized the army while denigrating the actual army, calling it a ""convent.""  Rosenblum writes: ""once again, exclusion of women, even if unspoken, is central to the rejection of civil society."" (23)</p>
<p>This makes sense in lieu of the comment that follows the quote from page 21 just above.  The rejection of women she seems to think is the rejection of civil society itself, something that liberalism basically cannot abide.</p>
<p>""...no matter how much liberal though may identiify individualism with the strong, with self-won independence and the emancipation of desires, it entials respect for others.  It entails a minimum of utilitarian attention to the general happiness.  Liberal individualism is inseparable from calculation and self-control.  These are missing from romantic heroism.  Missing too is the recognition that every action comes up against the action of others.  In liberal thought, neither civil society nor war could ever be a scene of pure self-assertion, because whereever there is more than one person, there is external resistance and constraint.  Action in the world means acknowledging the limits of one's powers and the impossiblity of self-sufficiency.  Recognition of these limits impels men and women to give up natural freedom in the first place; it is what makes consent to government possible.""

"The Pre-Freudian Georges Devereux, the Post-Freudian Alfred Kroeber, and Mohave Sexuality","<p>Quick Notes 7/5/10:</p>
<p>This is an interesting article with several implications.</p>
<p>1) it's usefult to me because it is an instance in which Murray does a critique of the ""ethnographic present"", see pp. 17, 21.  His basic point is that Devereux seemed to assume, without any basis for doing so, that Mohave sexual practices had always been the same without there being any historical change, despite the radical changese that these poeple had undergone since European contact!  More than that though there are some instances as on p.21 when Devereux seems to interpret the Mohave as a ""modern"" people!  Now, Murray seems to think this is wrong, and he's write from the point of view of historical epistemology, but then on the other hand as a historian, how interesting that Devereux does this!!</p>
<p>2) The other things going on here is the discussion of sexuality among anthropologist also.  Now Murray doesn't, as he should, place this alongside analyses going on with Benedict and Mead and others. ACtually, he leaves it to Kroeber, whose forward to Devereeux's dissertation he includes here, to mention Mead.  But of course Kroeber never like Mead's text.  Kroeber approves of Devereux's analysis, which in his ""Note on Methods"" is a ""highly abstract reflection [b/c Murray notes that D has very little fieldowrk experience], with allusions to theoretical physics, about th epossiblity of turning cultural materials that are not consistent or rational, and that contain several patterns, into rational (structural) models.  He asserted that 'social science will needd to evolve a symolic logic of their own, little related to mathetmical logic,' and mentioned (Edward) Sapir and (Paul) Radin..."" (18)  After this, then, D becomes an orthosdox Freudian and eventually tries to publish abook on Mohave SExuality (and Murray talks about trying to get it published, though he doesn't say why, but notes that the problem was always the fear that it would offend and that D's method was not satisfactory...)</p>
<p>This article made me wonder more about what's not here then what is here.  There's a lot of absences and evasions in Kroeber's introduction.  It deserves a closer read... There's something more to be found in all of this and I would love to look at D's diss and the ms. of the Mohave Sexuality text.</p>"

The Cultural Return,"<p>Notes 3/2012</p>
<p>Hegeman begins the book with a very frank statement of her own contextual relationship to the project:&nbsp; The book she says is an attempt to make sense of her own ""local context as an academic trained in the latter part of one century and yet living in another.""&nbsp; (ix)&nbsp; She contrasts the earlier period as one in which she was faced with a ""host of exciting possibilities broad about by the intellectual challenges of theory and interdisciplinarity"" with the latter where she is ""reckoning with forces that still evade comprehension: globalization, financiliation, neoliberlaism, and (perhaps most peronally undirgirding it all) what often feel like the final days of the American century's grand experiment in public higher education.""&nbsp; (ix)</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>* Being more specific she states that the ""historical context"" of the book is the ""apparent exhaustion of cultural studies as a central intellectual formation of the the interpretive social sciences, adn the concomittant struggle to identify the terms and methods by which to key these fields to an interpretation of our current global, social, political, economic, and geographical sitaution."" (3)</p>
<p>* She says ""globalization"" is then just a keyword for a ""general experience of historical change"" within which there are certain key events that are relevant: the post-1989 breakup of the Soviet Union and the ""global supremacy"" of neoliberal doctrine.&nbsp; (3)</p>
<p>* She sees as a consequence of these developments a ""backlash against the identitarian politics of the 1960s, including both theoretical and state-sanctioned multiculturalism."" (3) This involves a turn away from a politics of ""recognition"" of cultural minorities to a new emphasis on ""race-blind"" policies and civic integration of minorities. (3) But these shifts are not often linked to reactionary right-wing developments but ""buttressed with high-minded reference to state-security, the rights of women and sexual minorities, and the core values of Western liberalism."" (3)</p>
<p>* That roll-back of multiculturalism has been accompanied by an unseating of poststructuralist critiques of totalizing theories.&nbsp; Only, the turn has mostly seen a return of grand narratives of Enlightenment and the West, and not capitalism or socialism.&nbsp; (4)</p>
<p>* Most interestingly, she says that in the academy this return of master narratives has produced a ""renewal of interests in aesthetics, ethics, and even theology."" (4) There's a return she says to ""literary formalism"" and in general a rejection of interdisciplinary muddiness and a demand for disciplinarity clarity.&nbsp; These demands come along with polemics against ""culturalism"" and historicism and ""content analysis."" (3)&nbsp; She notes that ""cultural studies"" is usually labeled as the ""imperialist"" disciplinary villian.&nbsp; And ""[t]othis overreaching, relativistic, anarchic, and hypocritically market-oriented cultural studies is opposed a newly sober, properly disciplined study of the good, the true, and the beautiful."" (5) Hence aesthetics...</p>
<p>(Key here I tihnk is that I think for Hegeman aesthetics is understood as a particular ideology of justification of the liberal-bourgeois order... as in Eagleton's article on the subject...?&nbsp;</p>
<p>* She traces this return to aesthetics on 5-6 /&nbsp; Alexander Alberro sees it as a response to a contemporary moment defined by a series of ""catastrophes"" in the face of which it is somehow unsurprising that there has been a call by writers for a ""pathos-infused, humanist aesthetics."" (5) Alan Badiou sees it as a failure of the left after teh collapse of revolutionary marxism, where the left has adopted the ""principles of the established 'Western' order"" instead of seeking out ""terms of new politics of collective liberation..."" (5)</p>
<p>* The reaction to a sense of crisis that is propelling a return to aesthetics she think si also evident in ""calls for the return to the aesthetic, where beauty is aligned with a realm of pleasure neglected by the modernist (and political) emphasis on the sublime."" (5) She cites Wendy Steiner's <em>Venus in Exile</em>.&nbsp; But also ""more complexly"" she points to an arguemnt by Chris Castiglia and Ross Castronovo about how cultural studies ""debunked"" traditional essentialized identities but did so ""without supplying in their stead grounds for collective life that are affectively satisfying as well as theoretically plausible."" (quoted on 5)&nbsp; Castiglia and Castronovo see the tIntroductionurn to aesthetics as a respond to this ""putative failure"" in that it ""traffics in affective sensations that promise--without necessarily providing--post-identity or non-normative forms of collectivism."" (quoted on 5)&nbsp; Castiglia and Castronovo Hegeman points out are interested in ""resolving the individualism of aesthetic experience with collectivity: that is, in renegotiating the relationship between aesthetics and politics."" (5-6)&nbsp; She thinks this is pretty typical of the new calls for a consideration of aesthetics, much as she says those (e.g. Nussbaum) calling for a return to ethics are interested in ""bridging the gap between humanist universals and the particularities of identity and subjectivity."" (6)</p>
<p>* She is not against these kinds of projects that seek to find an ""intersection between aesthetics and politics, collective identity and private pleasure, universal and local values, or form and content"", but and she sees the present book as involved in such a ""dialetical"" project. But she is suspicious of these calls. She seems to think that they are anti-dialetical or against the kind of ""mediation"" that she would assume such a project of finding intersections would entail. She sees these poeple calling for a turn against interdisciplinary studies tha tmarks cutlural studies, and a limitiation of literary to the Literary, film studies to the ""Filmic"" etc.&nbsp; And ""humanitiesp edagogy in general to either an affective or an ethical encounter with beauty or pleasure."" (6) So she suspects these calls are reactionary and that they seek to ""carry us back grouhd the various sea changes of the last fifty years."" (6)</p>
<p>* So what she wants to do is investigate ""why such calls for renovation feel necessary at this particular moment and--perhaps even more centrally--why they even feel like a change or a break at all."" (6)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* The culture concept is ideal for this because within cutlural criticism as she understands it as does Frederic Jameson culture has stood for (quoting Jameson) ""the space of mediation betwee society or everday life and art as such."" (quoted on 6) .&nbsp; This is a key ""space"" for Jameson because it is a domain in which art has the real possiblity of ""redeeming"" or ""transfiguring"" a ""fallen society."" (6)&nbsp; Jameson further noted that for those who feel a ""malaise"" about the blurring of boundaries that such criticism involved it ""becomes crucial to break the link, to challenge an dphilosophically discredit the conept of culture, in order to protect the space of art against further incursions of contamination."" (7)&nbsp; So culture is for the people that Hegeman is looking at and those making this ""call"" for a return to clear disciplinary lines&nbsp; and and a humanist aesthetics and ethics because it is the sign of the ""degredation of art"" and of hte blurring of disciplinary boudnaries. (7)</p>
<p>[Note: But this does not account for the critique on the left that Nancy for example has made that culture distracted from concerns of resource distribution, ie materialist concerns, political economy etc...&nbsp; Does Hegeman address these concerns anywhere? ]</p>
<p>* She sees the ""repudiation of the concept of culture"" as a the ""transdiscipolinary phoneomenon that best represents our current perceived movement of intellectual rupture with the recent past."" (7) It involves renewed attention she says to aesthetics in art history, literature and film studies, but also certain straings of argumetnation in ""historical studies, philosophy political science, and especially anthropology..."" (7)</p>
<p>* She notes that a key part of the 1980s and 1990s cultural turn was in fact a full on critique of culture, which was portrayed as ""overly rigid, ahistorical, reifying, sneakily polemical or evaluative, racist, normativizing, and elitist."" (7) These critiques led to a redefinition of the term as ""hybrid, multivocal, migratory, and endlessly contested..."" and this shift she notes was only possible after the ground-clearing of the concept that took place int he cultural turn. (7) That is, the cultural turn was marked by a constant discussion about what culture was. (7-8) A lot of that work took place in the field of history of anthropology and was about the Boasians, see 7-8 for her summary.</p>
<p>* Lately, she ntoes Richard Fox and Barbara J. King have argued that anthropologist should get ""beyond culture"". The discipline they think does not need a consensus on this term. She thinks this turn may then be a sign of the end of the cultural turn, i.e. ""[w]hen the worry is over, then indeed it seems that a&nbsp; new moment int he discourse has emerged that does what so many of its polemicists have proposed: 'forget culture,' get 'beyond culture.'"" (8) She notes that Victoria E. bonnel and Lynn Hunt (who was a key figure int he new cultural hsitory) have recently proposed to get beyond culture in a 1999 volume.</p>
<p>* And then there is Michael Denning's book which she describes as being ""inflected by world systems analysis"" and ""exemplary of the disciplinary context of the turn away from the cultural turn."" (8) She thinks Denning's book is interesting b/c it highlights how the moment of the turn away also can be understood as a shift in the interdisciplinary relationship between the humanities and the social sciences. Much fo the cultural turn involved an exchange between anthropologya nd the humanities, at the center of which was Geertz's work and the Interpreation of Cultures book which inspired the new historicism and the new cutlural history. Cultural studies also turned toward anthropology, and then also anthropology itself had its own ""reflexive turn"" in whcih it accepted much fo the poststructural thoery then cutting edge in the humanities. Set against all this, the current repudiation of the cultural turn suggests a end of this interdisciplinary exchange, or better a shift toward a new orientation toward geography and world-systems analysis, as is the case with Denning's book. (8-9)</p>
<p>* BUT <strong>Hegeman thinks all this sense of the end of culture is a bit false</strong>. She notes that the term is not yet ""vanquished."" (9) She thinks that the calls to get rid of culture ""presuppose a fantasy of purely transparent communication or, worse, an idealism in which concepts somehow operate independently of the contexts in which they are deployed."" (9) And she thinsk that culture has not so much gone away as it ""has diffused into the woodwork of myriad discursive sites."" (9) She goes through a series of example: law (she enters the word culture into Lexis-Nexis) where it is used in case-law in a number of ways; the ""culture wars"" e.g. Bill O'Reilly etc; the use of culture to describe ""corproate culture"" for example or national cultures in public; its use by conservatives (11-12).&nbsp;</p>
<p>* What then does it mean that culture has becmoe avaialble for so many uses? And here she notes the critique (in this case coming from Rorty in <em>Achieving Our Country</em> and from Walter Benn Micahels) that the cultural turn involved a neglect of inequality and problems of distribution. And that those who were impressed with it were either dupes or never interested in issues of economic disparity in the first place. (13) But she says: ""To those impressed by arguemtns such as Rorty's, I would ask whetherwe&nbsp; msut really see the cutlural field as rigidly distinct from isseus of economic inequality. Is the separation, it it exists, really as final and fatal as he suggets.? Analytically, I don't believe it is: When are interethnic conflicts not also inflected with issues of economic exploation and subordination? but rhetorically, I believe we are in danger of ceding the domain of culture to those who we arleady known have a deliberately limiting understanding of it. In other words, we need not only to take back the terms of the public debate, of which I believe 'culture' remains an indisputable part, but to do an overall better job even among ourselves in defining and defending the ground of culture."" Here she agrees with Peter Richerson and Robert Boyd who have argued that those on the left have ceded ground on culture's definition. (13)</p>
<p>* IN the interest of regaining control, then, she wants to know what it would mean to develop a ""socially progressive"" idea of culture. (14) She says that she is here very interested in the ""Boasians"" use of culture and that of Raymond Williams. Boas and his students she says ""theorized 'cutlure' in the context of a very important and in its day quite challenging point that went to the heart of both nineteenth-century racial theory and romatnic nationalism: that there is no necessary relationship or spatial contiguity between natiuon-states, languages, races, and cultures."" (14) This she notes seems commonsense now but it was a powerful critique at the time. Similarly, culture was powerful in breaking people out of notions of biological destiny, and she uses Mead's Coming of Age in Samoa example. All this leads her to this sense that culture is -- as she quoted Jameson earlier -- a sign of alternative possibilites: ""The cultural was the site of that which was malleable, subject to the processes of history and contact, but most of all subject to change through education--to enlightenment...."" (15) And against this one finds a series of actors: conservative cultural warriors [I think of Shannon!!], as well as academic ritics of culture, defenders of ""Enlightenmetn"", and even popular users of culture. All she says hold a hostility to the ""transofrmative possibilities for and through culture..."" -- i.e. Jameson's sense of culture as that thing that could redeem a fallsen society. (15)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* The irony, though, is that although academics today acknowledge the transformative dimension of culture, most often it is sued in precisely the opposite sense, as a term that refers to fixity. It is sued popularlly in a way that hues closely to the word ""heritage."" Academics are wary of the idea that culture could be used for social engineering. And phrases like drug culture or corporate culture, etc, it is used to indicate ""a more or less intractable apttern of group behavior."" (15) And even more ironically while ""'culture' thus seems increasingly <em>less</em> connotative of alteration, the <em>biological</em> seems, in an odd reversal, increasingly to be a site of plasticity and change."" (15)</p>
<p>* That said she thinks there may also ahve been some victories. She notes that few in the U.S. would ""acceded to the idea that the United States as a nation is coextensive with <em>one</em> culture, <em>one </em>race, <em></em>or even one language."" (16) She also sees a broader delinking of race, language, and nationality in for example ""the international trend in immigration law, which which citizenship is increasingly assigned according to the location of one's birth rather than based on citizenship of one's parents."" (16) This breakdown of the link of race, language, and culture to nation is also evident she thinks in the vernacular use of culture to describe drug culture or corporate culture. And it also explains she says the ""elaboration of theological, environmentalist, and other usages of the idea of culture that transcend locality and particularity."" (16) And she says ""culture"" is now ensosnced in human rights law, as she shows in her final chapter.</p>

The Development of Ethnological Theory as Illustrated by Studies of the Plains and Sun Dance,"[Summary Note]
This article traces the shifts in theory in relation to the study of the Plains Sun Dance.  It must be taken with a grain of salt because Bennett may want to see a development toward a funcionalist anthropological method because that is what dominates in his era (1944).  There are several moments where he rephrases the insights of the people he is talking about in what seems to be a funcitonalist idiom....eg. 165 ""Or rephrased in contemporary terminology...""  
This was first studied by Lowie in the his Sun Dance of the Shoshoni, Ute, and Hidatsa (1919); then by Leslie Spier in his dissertation, The Sun Dance of the PLains Indians (1921); then used by Wissler as an important phase of his proof of the age and culture-area system in The Relation of the nature to Man in Aboriginal America; then Dixon in 1928 in The Building of Cultures and then Kroeber in 1929 criticized Wissler's use of Spier's analysis...  Kroeber publishes on this in The Culture Area-Age Area Concepts of Clark Wissler, criticizing Wissler for misusing Spier, who he represented as sorking toward a more historical picture rather than toward a kind of law of cultural transmission... 
Bennett goes in depth into Spier's analysis essentially arguing that the difference between Speir's account and Lowie's is that Spier was beginning to move away from the conservative Boasian model of historical distribuiton-reconstruction analysis and towards a ""more or less funcitonal analysis of orgnaization, mythology, processes of diffusion and modification.""  (168)  
Thus for Bennett, Spier is moving away from the historical approach of distribution-reconstruction typical of the 20s that grew from Boas' rigidly empirical brand of anthropology.  (See 162.)
A rereading of this may be in order for what it may reveal about the typica llogic of 20s anthropology..."
Urbanizing Frontiers: Indigenous Peoples and Settlers in 19th-Century Pacific Rim Cities,"<p>General Notes 7/2012</p>
<p><strong>Intro: </strong></p>
<p>* Book starts with a Boas quote about what he saw in Victoria in 1886. Victoria was the provincial capital of British Columbia. It had been founded in 1843 ""on the territory of the Lekwammen peoples as a for for the Hudson's Bay Company."" Edmonds says that by the late ningteenth century the city ""was heralded as one fo the future lights of the British Empire on the Pacific Rim."" (3)&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Boas quote is this: ""The stranger coming for the first time to Victoria is startled byt he great number of Indians living in this town...we met them everywhere. They dress mostly in European fashion. the men are dock workers, craftsmen or fish vendors; the women are washerwomen or working women...certain Indian tribes have become indispensable to the labour market and without them the province would suffer great economic damage."" (quoted on 3, from John Lutz, ""After the Fur Trade: The Aboriginal Labouring class of British Columbia, 1849-1890"" <em>Journal of the Canadian Historical Association </em>3, 1 (1992): 82.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>* Edmonds is making a comparative study of pacific rim urbanizing centers as frontier spaces of hybridity and diversity, primarily Victoria and Melbourne.&nbsp; She wants to look at the history of ""disposession and displacement"" in these urbanizing centers. She asks: ""How should we understrand the story of urban dispossession in these settler colonies, wihch were marked by differing but related sequences of change? And how shold we understand the shifiting constructions of race and segregation in these two urbanizing port cities at the far reaches of Britain's empire?"" (5)</p>
<p>* She is making a critique of the way colonial spaces and empire have been studied. ""Colonial frontiers did not exist only in the bush, backwoods, or borderlands; they clearly sat at the heart of early town and city building, a process crucial to the settler-colonial project."" (5) Then letter in the section ""Reiminaing the Colonial Frontier"" she describes the description of the frontier she is trying to get away from : ""Settler colonialism's nineteenth-century frontier has been routinely conceptualized as a dsitinctly non-urban geogrpahical sapce that sits somewhere out int he country or borderlands. The frontier is frequently portrayed as a liminal zone without rules, a zone that was characterized by violence, forced removal, and disposesion for Indigenous peoples. The frontier has also been inaccurate conceptualized by some historians as a linear phenomenon that marked civilization from savagery, as a site where they can record 'official,' martial-style engagements between males as&nbsp; areflection of colonial relations.&nbsp; Instead, I wondered about early cities and towns as developing frontiers, as equally cahrged and often-violent sites of racialized spatial contestations. These frontiers were mosaic-like -- mercurial, transactional, and, importantly, intimate and gendered."" (6)</p>
<p>* The point here, which goes to the first paragraph of her book and teh Boas quote, is that natives were present in these cities, and not just on the edge of the ""linear"" frontier. And the presence of Indians in these frontier cities, she says, has often been erased from memory (6-7) Whereas she says ""early towns and cities were often the greatest sites of contesation, as many newspapers and settler reports of the time attested."" (7)</p>
<p>* So she will look closely at ""race, segregatioin, and Indigenous and non-Indigenous lives int hese two Pacific Rim cities, which were fashioned by British settler colonialism between the years 1835 and 1871, a period that began with the first European settlement at Port Phillip and ended with British Columbia beecoming a province of the Dominion of Candada."" (5)</p>
<p>* She sees her self also as taking a ""postcolonial perspective"" focusing on the ""racialized politics of these two settler-colonial landscapes at the spatial, imaginative, social and legal levels and in a comparative context."" (5)</p>
<p>* Language gets complex here but what she sees the book as doing also in looking at these sites is that she's looking at these cities and their ""racialized transformations"" as ""formative sites"" wehre ""bodies and spaces were rapidly transofrmed and mutually imbricated"" (confusing sentence) -- but all this in a way that created ""plural cultural modernities."" (5)</p>
<p>* She wants to look at space as a site of active construction of contested meanings, in combination with race. She notes that a lot more work these days looks at the constructured nature of space and race, seeing them as historically generated, and she cites Henry Lefebvre's book on the <em>The Production of Space</em> (1974) as a major origin of htis line of thinking. (10)</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>* The narrative here is about the completion of a settler-colonial project of organizing bodies and space. One fo the first sentences of the Conclusion is: ""By the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the reorganization and regulation of bodies and spaces in the desire foramtion of white settle-colonial polities was thoroughgoing. An overt and bigorous transnational discourse of whiteness, white man's land, and white labour had formed through the British settler colonies."" (230)</p>
<p>* There was she says a ""sharing of restrictive immigration policies among (fomer) British colonies."" (230)</p>
<p>*&nbsp; A major question was what to do about chinese immigrants and the colonies shared anti-Asian policies too. (230-231) Australia, Canada, and New Zealand had by 1885 a ""dual-immigrant policy"" consisting fo the Immigration Act and Chinese Immigration Act, which was designed to encourage high Euroepan immigrantion and to lower Chinese Immigration. (231)</p>
<p>* She says that notions of Aboriginality became narrower and narrower as ""thinking about race become bureaucratized and systemaized."" (231) ""Indian affairs"" became an internal issue after 1871 when British Columbia joined ""Confederation"" Then the Indian Act of 1876, enacted by Parliament, ""provided Canada's federal government excuslive authority to legislate in realtion to 'Indians and Lands Reserved for Indians.'"" (231)</p>
<p>* Followiong the Indian Act of 1876, the ""most pressing issues"" were how Aboriginal land was amnaged. ""First Nations wer eplaced under increased pressure to use reserve lands in ways demeed to be civilizerd and in line with the dominant society's expectations; when this did not happen, it was argued that they did not deserve the land.' (232) In general, their is a weakening of claims to native lands in B.C. in the 1870s. Then between 1903 and 1915 the premier Ricahrd McBride asserted that the province had ""reversionary rights to both Crown and First Nations lands."" (232) There were then significant dislocations of Indian peoples. in 1911, the province bought the Lekwammen Reserve on Victorian's Inner Harbour. The Lekwammen were then ""relocated"" to a reserve called Maplebank in Esquimalt. The <em>Victoria Daily Colonist</em> wrote the athe ""leave taken by the Songhees of their home and that of their fatehrs was marked by dignity, goohed feelin and restraint."" (232) Apparently the Lekwammen had on good clothes and the newspaper reproted that onlookers had seen the Lekwammen ""driving about the city with their own autos!"" (quoted on 232) Then in 1913 the Suamish and Musqueam, who lived in what is now around Burard Street Bridge, lost their land in a similar way. She writes ""As they rowed away on the appointed day, with their payments sured by bank books given out to them, their shacks were burned to the ground."" (232)</p>
<p>* Similar lines of change with more control in the (australian) colony of Victoria.&nbsp; Also what she describes as ""disicplianry measure and sptatial regimes."" (233) These were designed to ""reorder notions of gender and class among Aboriginal peoples to align them with modern settler society."" (233) Most important bill in this direction was the 1885 Half-Caste Act, passed in the same year as Boas had noted teh presence of Indians in Victoria, Vancouver Island. It reinforced notions of racial purity by banning all mixed-descent indians from livign on the reserves. ""The effects of the Act were devestating. It broke up families and forced many Aboriginal people out of missions, where they eked out a difficutl existence ont he outskirs of towns among a white population that generally did not accept them."" (234)&nbsp; Then two years later Thomas Avoca, his wife, and two unrelated children were ""placed on display in an ethnographic-style tableeau vivant."" (234) -- a point that Edmonds started the book with. Avoca had been actively protesting ""infrigngements of his rights at Coranderrk STation..."" (234) But here he and his wife were presented preformatively. (Where are their voices in all of this??) When Melbourne joined ""Federation"" in 1901 the census counted on 36 aboriginal peoples., and only 652 were counted in the whole state, and those were differentiated according to being ""pure"" or half-caste, the numbers being 217 and 381 repsectively. (235)</p>
<p>* She has this sentence again where she refers to ""modernity"" -- without defining it it seems. On the end of this section about the laws that solidified notions of racial purity, implemented in the urban sapce of thsi settler-colonial cities she writes: ""Internally and extrenally, these former British colonis in the Pacific Rim, in the pursuti of a transcolonial polity&nbsp; of Anglo-Saxon colonies, had reordered bodies and spaces and, by doing so, systematically made new spaces of modernity."" (235)</p>
<p>* She then switches to present day. Her point is that, say, in Melbourne the street names have been given Aboriginal names. But these invocation in fact she thinks reinforces the ""epic trajectory of settler-colonial history."" (236) But there are ongoing contestations. In March 2006, the Blac GST group ""<br />""(stop genocied, recognize soverity and make treaty)"" camped out in King's Domaint to protest, and this drew renewed attention to a problem that never went away, See 236-7. Against this backgorund she points out that the</p>
<blockquote>
<p>settler-colonial city should ve biewed as a <em>process</em> rather than as a site of colonial modernity. Close study of Melbourne and Victoria reveal s a key process of settler colonialism: the crucial and rapid transformations of commually owned Indigenous land into private property, which underpinened the colonial order. Inherent in this transformation was the vioelnt and coercive reorganization and production of bodies and spaces to shape white, British, imperial urban landscapes. Inherently racialized processes increaingly sought to regulate and remove Indigenous people fromt he urban frontier and were bolstered by stadial theory; a driving Western historicizing narrative of Anglo-Saxon expansionism; and bourgeois metropolitanism. In the idealized narrative of historical development, the settler city represented the highest and most progressive stage of empire, and its precondition was the absnece of Indigenous peoples. By the mid- to late nineteenth century,a ttempts to shape a white or Anglo-Saxon colonial polity and assocaited struggles over bodies and spaces in the urbanizing frontier were paramount to the success of the settler-colonial enterprise and to each colony's imagined self. that the ity was viewed as&nbsp; reflection fo the state and as a metaphor for the territory and how to govern reveal s just how deeply ideas about the city as the consummation of empire were entrenched in the imperial imagination. (239)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>* Then she also begins to talk about not the creation of <strong>a modernity</strong>--which was perhaps the goal of the settler-colonial process--but rather the creation plural different ""colonial modernities."" (240) As such these cities ""became anxious sites, nervous terrains"" where ""increasingly stratified and bureaucratizedideas about race were marked out recursively on bodies and spaces alike."" (240&nbsp; THERE IS A FAIR AMOUNT OF REPETITION IN THIS BOOK!!</p>
<p>* Now she begins some more comparative analysis. A key different was that in B.C. the extractive industries, ie forestry, fishign, etc ""required"" First Nations people to work, whereas in Melbourne where there was more pastorlaism there was no need for Aboriginal workers and required instead the remove of Aborigines from the land. Also in B.C,. mixed-race relationships that were the legacy of the fur trade were much more common. (240-1)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Another interesting comparative note is that although the spaces were linked by common processes of colonization, immmigration,a nd indigenonization in the northwest ""notions of whiteness were highly expansive and fugitive.""&nbsp; So ""In the city of Victoria, Indigenous peoples and families of mixed descent, the legacy of the fur trade, represented an inidgenized polity."" But as settlement in creased and race notions hardened the some mixed-race families tried to ""Anglicize"" themselves as race lines hardened. In Melbourne, mixed relations had ""always been viewed as marginal to middle-calss European mores"". As a resutl European mean tried to ""disavow or hide"" their relations with Aboriginal women. (242)</p>
<p><strong>Some notes on Ch. 8: ""Nervous Hybridity: Bodies, Spaces, and the Displacements of Empire [Victoria, British Columbia, 1858-71]</strong></p>
<p>* Chapter starts with a pretty great quote from a British Colonist in 1860: ""We will not amalgamate with them. Our race sweeps on, our civilisation knows no halt; and as fast as we cut down the trees the red man disappears."" <strong>(206)</strong></p>
<p>* What this chapter more or less traces is the somehow impossible but deliberate attempt to eliminate the mixed-race mosaic of races in Victoria, which was the legacy of the fur trade. It was impossible in part because the fur trade had created so many mixed-race families and the intertwining of race as a result was difficult to undo.</p>
<p>* Edmonds traces the growth of settler hostiltiy to racial hybrids especially in relationship to Indian women, who were viewed as prostitutes and dangerous to the white colonial state. Prostitution was seen as vice; Indians were prostitues because of their racial status. And Victoria was feared in particular because it was a port city. Edmonds reads that quote that she heads the chapter with, and which she puts in the text on 222, as the ""putting on"" of a ""brave face"" in the face of a very real reality of a mixed-race society in Victoria. (221-222)</p>
<p>* The stakes were raised and the discourse about race and sexual vice in relation to Indigenous peoples was developed in relation to what Edmonds calls the ""great Victorian santiary idea"" and the fear of sexually transmitted diseases, which she ddeals with in a section starting on 222. She notes taht scholars have ""written about santiation as a featur eof urbanizing bourgeois modernity in the colonies, particular how it was harnessed to manage colonized peoples and regulate both urban bodies and spaces."" (222) She cites Harriet Deacon, ""Racial Segregation and Medical Discourse in Nineteenth-Century Cape Twon,"" <em>Journal of Southern African Studies</em> 22, 2 (1996): 287-308, and Vivieenne Bickford-Smith<em>, Ethnic and Racial Prejudice in Victorian Cape Town: Group Identity and Social Practice</em> (Cambridge,1988).</p>
<p>* This movmeents comes to Victoria, B.C. in&nbsp; June 1862 when for the firs time there is an Act discussed ""For the appointemnt of&nbsp; Sanitary Commission for the town of Victoria, and to define the powers thereof."" (quotedon on 223). The target was ""squaw dancing houses"", often owned by white elites in the city, which were noted as ""placeds ofmixed-race licentiousness"" Edmonds says, but then were ultimately given a kind of ""legal ambialence"" in regards to the prostituiton that sometimes went on within. Edmonds writes; ""This legal ambivalence was also related to the discretionary power in herent in policing. First Nations women were increasingly pushed out of cities and towns, but the continued existence of certain immoral spaces in which they maintained a presence served a purpose -- it secured the 'respectability of white urban cities' and maintained white men's access to First Nations women. We see this in Victoria's streetscape The sexualized exigenciues of colonialism required 'immoral' spaces, justa s racial purity required 'moral' spaces.&nbsp; The settler-colonial project in both British Columbia and southeastern Australia was indeed one of 'gendered territorialism.' And it was ever so in the urban frontier."" (224)</p>
<p>* Then there was a spike in this interest in sanitation vv prositution in 1862-63 with a small pox epidemic.&nbsp; This propelled segregationist policy and a push to further limit contact between whites and First Nations people. But Edmonds writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But this was impossible because of the legacy of the fur trade's mixed marriages and the presence -- as labourers, servants and purveyors and consumers of food and goods -- of First Nations in town. A neat paritioning of the urban frontier was not possible. The <em>British Colonist</em> complained: 'They line our streets, fill the pit in our theatre, are found at nearly every open door during the day, and evening of the town; and are even employed as servants in our dwellings, and in the culinary department of our restaurants and hotels.' Despite attempts to segregate it, the urban frontier was as fluid, intimate, mixed and psychic as it was material. (225)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, she writes the ""smallpox epidemic legitimated a series of forced removals."" (225) For example in the North, in May 1862, the ""Northern Indians"" who were blaimed as the source of smallppox were ""forced out of harbour by gunboat"" -- an act that Edmonds says ""led to the spread of smallpox and the deaths of many First Nations farther up the Coast, an even that was devestating in its effect on the Indigenous population."" (225) She doesn't give details here. Then in 1866, the colonies of Vancouver Island ""passed laws for the whoelsale remove of Aboriginal peoples."" (225) Then she quotes from an article entitled ""The Seat of Diseasee"" in the <em>British Columbian from 1869: </em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a section of this city lying north of Johnson and between Government and Store streets, which bids fair to prove a prolific source of disease during the approaching summer. It is inhabited chiefly by Indians and Chinese, who dwell in low and fitlhy cabins, and display the most profound disregard for all recognized codes of cleanliness...These poeple, as they now conduct themselves, are a nuisance and a plague-spot upon this fair city, and they should be made to either live ads become the civilized beings, and keep their premises in proper condition, or take themselves beyond the limits of the city. (226)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>* This new emphasis on medialization and racialization of Indigenous bodies Edmonds says was a key feature of ""bourgeois, urbanizing modernity."" (226)</p>
<p>* So whereas the vagrancy law hadnot been applied to Indigenous peoles in Victoria in the 1860s (unlike in Melbourne), in 1869 the police chief August F. Pemberton attempted to apply it. (226)</p>
<p>* Edmonds ends the chapter with a work by Matthew MacFie from 1865. MacFie used the polygenist theory of Josiah Clark Nott and Geiorge R Glidden's <em>Types of Mankind </em>to define Victoria as a place containing ""twenth-three [racial] crosses, in different degrees, resutling from the belnding of the Caucasian, the aboriginal American, and the Negro."" (227) And this caused him fear.&nbsp; So he was drawing on Nott and Glidden's work to define a defense of Anglo-Saxon racialism. And that's whereEdmonds suggests things were moving in Victoria...</p>"
"History of Germany, 1780-1918","<p>Notes 9/2013:</p>
<p>&gt; These notes taken very selectively. Trying to get a sense of certain themes for Manifold Origins chapter. The themes: role of industrialization, class development, 1848 revolution, emigration, political reactions to industrialization, neo-Kantians, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>### Ch. 4 Economy and Society Transformed.</p>
<p>#### Industrialization</p>
<p>* 1840s is talked about as the start of German industrialization, but it was till patchy in this decade. Still importanting raw iron and steel for railways. Few join-stock companies. Governemnts followed reestritive credit policy. (135) Following decades were more important and by 1870s, ""Germany possessed an unmistakably capitalist market economy."" (135)</p>
<p>* Role played by state in industrialization? Nationalist historians have exagerated the role of the states and especially given too much of a role ot the <em>Zollverein</em>. More modern historians ahve been more skeptical, noting ""the relatively small amounts that even advanced states like Prussia actually put into fostering economic growth."" (140) Also although the state built canals and highways, the German rail network wa smostly in private hands. Though the south German railwas were state-owned. And in Prussia there&nbsp; was ""substantial state investment in railways"". (141) The mines of the Saar and parts of Silesia were state-owned. (141) So in the end Blackbourn says: ""All this was typical of a Continental rather than an Anglo-Saxon road to industrialization, one marked by closer links between private capitalism and the state."" (141) He gives as a great example the fact that German chambers of commmerce, whichi n the Anglo-phone context are imagined as private associations, were in Germany ""semipublic, semiprivate institutions, fostered by the state."" (141) And the&nbsp;<em>Zollvereiin</em> -- a ""growing and dynamic free trade area that was successful enough to persuade businesses from neighbouring Belgium and Siwtzerland to establish themsevles in Germany"" (141) -- was also important, esp. after early 1850s when Hannover joined. (140-141)</p>
<p>#### Emigration, Migration, Urbanization</p>
<p>* Emigration was big in Germany in the mid 19th century. There had always been emigration even bbefore to eastern and Southeastern Europe. But in htis period the volume was unprecedented. First wave 1840s, 1.3 millino people left Germany, 1845-1858. Peak year 1854, 1/4 million. Then declining numbers. Another wave in 1880. 860,000 leaving between 1880-1885. 220,000 in 1881 alone. Slowed to a trickly again after 1890s. (145-146)</p>
<p>* Why did people go? Some had religious and political motives. Swabians pietists to Russia, Prussian old-Luterhans to America or Australia. 1848ers left, most noteably Carl Schurz. Socialist and CAatholic victims of political opression after 1870.&nbsp; Economic distress a major cause. The first wave was mostly small peasants and craftsmen from overpopulated rurla areas in the South: i.e. Baden, Buertenerg the Palatinate. Rural overpopulation also the cause of the second wave. So that Blackbourn describes emigration as the ""safety-valve"" of rural overpopulation. ""it followed the rhythm o rural distress, with a certain time-lag."" (146)</p>
<p>* Where did immigrants go? They went to other areas on the Continent, Russia, Blegum, the Nethrelands. Tehre was a large German community in Paris, somewhere around 80,000-100,000 people. But most went to the US, 85% - 90%. 4.5 million Germans left between 1847 and WWWI. 4 Million went to the US. Brazil was a 2nd. w/ 86,000. (147)</p>
<p>* How was all&nbsp; this opssible? the railways was key, allowing immigrants to reach ports of departure. Increases in capacity and declining costs of transatlatnic passage. At first, much traffic wen through Antwerp and Rotterdam to the US. Later, from Hamburg and Bremen in the north. There were a few of emgiration agencies and associations, who advertised. State agencies and churches also advised emigrants. The communications revolution, making possibl eltters aetc. Letters ""encouraged others to follow by painiting an idealized picture of a land of opportunity; the prepaid ticket brought th eopporutnity within reach. By the 1880s the 'uncle in America' was a familiar figure. The them of the frontier also played a part in best-selling novles like Gustav Freytag's <em>Soll und Haben</em>, and appolar litrature arose to trumpet the virutes of American opportunity, likeFriedrich Gerstaecker's <em>Nach Amerika!</em>."" (148)</p>
<p>* So ultimately one cn aay that ""GErmans had a place in he great nineteenth-century mass movement across the Atlantic. In the third quarter of the century they were rivalled only by the Irish in their contribution to the people of America. The peak period of German mass emigration coincided with that of other north Europeans (British, Irish, Scandinavians), overlapping at the end with the beginnings of growing emigration from southrn and eastern Europe."" (148)</p>
<p>#### A New Class Structure</p>
<p>* Blackborn starts by saying ""[c]lass is a set of relationships, not a thing, and changes in class structure are even more diffiucult to pin down than a process like industrialization."" (157) After 1850, though, class relations set in a differen tway he says. E.g. gorwing diision between masters and men ""under the new economic dispensation."" (157) Residential segregation, like the separation between middle-class suburbs like Wilmersdorf and Scheneberg and working class areas like Rixdorf or Lichtenberg. Also in the ""spheres of reproduction and sociability, dress and cuisine, the everyday realm where class values and mores were expressed."" (158) New written works pby political commentators, fashion writers, and authors of etiquette that elaborated the language of class. He gives exap of Wilhelm Heinrich Rielh's book 1851 Die <em>Buergerliche Gesellschaft</em>.(158)</p>
<p>* Blackbourn notes that for a long time German historians downplayed the emergence of a bourgeois class. for reasons that he gets into in his Ch. 8.</p>
<p>---- Reading form that section -----</p>
<p>* Having outlined the new class experience just before the war, 271-6, he takes up the so-called ""feudalizaiton"" thesis. or Bourgeois feudalization, the idea that the bourgeois were self-abasig themselves by apeing the styles of athe artistocracy, jetissoning their own values. Evidence f this is the acquring of a ""von"" in front of one's last name and buying a country ""Estate."" Adolf von Wilke talked about the ""new lords of the manor"" (278) Blackbourn pushes back against this thesis, saying that many viewed their estates in a pragmatic manner as a good place to entertai. I.e. ""Popmp and luuxury were sign of confidene, not self-abasement."" (278) Also this was a broad tendency across Europe, for the bourgeoisie to move closer to hte aristocracy. (279) Also there's new evidence that suggests that the bourgeoisie had borken off from the middle-class but without becoming artistocratic in their values. E.g. Some evidence exists in fact that among British entrepreneurs there were three to five times more ennobled individuals. Whereas Kirdorf, the Krupps, thyssen, these major Ruhr industiralizsts, declined enbbolement. Although Blackbourn notes taht this miht ahve been a lot lower among professionals than among entrepreneurs. Dueling...which is often used to support the feudalization thesis... it's not that it wasn't common. it was. But it was ""no mere imitation of feudal norms...the duel came to assume a place within a specifically bourgeois code of honour, centered on masculinity, and defined by possession of property, education, and reptuation. Middle-class men did not ape aristocratic models, but --in the words ofUte Frevert -- 'derived their own meanings from thosee models, meaning which directly corresponded to the bourgeois culture of individuality."" (280) So ultimately Blackbourn argues tha tthe</p>
<blockquote>
<p>""emerging consensus among historians is that the feudalization thiss has been overworked. If we are looking for distinctive features of German bourgois thinking, it makes more sense to consider attitudes towards the state. Attachment to army and reserve officer corps, discussed in the following section, was one aspect of that. The value ascribed to the Commercial Councillor title was another. Parallel titles for nonbusinessmen, like Sanitary Councillor (doctors) and Councillor of Justice (lawyers), were equally prized. The importance of titles does not end there. State examinations or offical service provided rich opportunities to distinguish oneself by title: Herr Dr, Provincial Governor, Professor, Senior Distrit Architect (ret.) -- these and countless other handles become an inseparable part of one'sname. The state provided accrediation and legitmimation. It was a source of prestige, the guardian of organized knowledge, and stood for values that the bourgeoisie held dear: seriousness, respect, rectitude -- the 'manly' virtues.(280)</p>

"'If there is nothing beyond the organic..."": Heredity and Culture at the Boundaries of Anthropology in the Work of Alfred L. Kroeber","<p>Notes 7/24/10:</p>
<p>Part 1 of her argument:</p>
<p>Kronfeldner is arguing that Kroeber's understanding of culture was strongly influenced by Weismannian notions of genetic inheritance.  The key idea here is that what Kroeber envisioned with his superorganic was a system of hereditary transmission ""of another sort.""  Here's her key quote on this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If culture andbiological evolution are as decoupled as Kroeber assumes, then culture becomes clearly visible as a separaet, second system of inheritance and change.  In the end, culture is conceived as being independent of biological heredity (culture as superorganic) and, at the same time, it is conceived as heredity of another sort.  A close epistemic coupling, via contrast and analogy, leads to a conceptual and causal decoupling of heredity and culture. (121)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The basis of her argument is her recongition of the fact that Kroeber referenced Weismann's essays in his debate with Spencer in 1890s, in which Weismann critqiued Spencer's use of the principle of ""inheritance of acquired modifications.""  K's discussion of this debate on 117-118 is informative.</p>
<p>K thinks that Weismann, in his critique of Spencer, ""stated that a point of view such as Spencer's ignores the fact that tradition, or culture in Kroeber's sense, makes Lamackian exaplanations superflous....According to Weismann, Spener confusese achievements (culture or cultural change) with innate abilities (nature or biological evolution).  He thus ignores the fact that the former can change without the latter.""  (118)</p>
<p>In other words, in her reading, Weismann had implicitly acknolwedged the existence of culture...which then Kroeber makes explicit in his superorganic essay. K cites Weismann in th eessay dicsusing the question of whether there could be a ""Samonaer Mozart""--the answer being theoretically yes in terms of mental capacity, but no for the lack of the traditiosn to facilitate the expression of that capacity. It seems from her analysis that Kroeber dismissed Weismann for becaues he (in Kreober's words) ""hastened to the inconsequent conclusiont hat faculties are probably different after all."" (quoted on 119, from p.37 in Kroeber's essay).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, she says: ""it follows from Weismann's and Kroeber's accounts that cultural evolution can proceed independently from biological evolution.""  (119)  She then shows K's graph with the diverging lines of the inorganic, organic and superorganic.</p>
<p>I don't tink her use of th workd ""evolution"" in cultural evolutoin is right here...I don't think that's what K was talking about.  I think it is fair to say that he was thinking of a system of transmission and development, but I don't think it needed to take an evolutionary form.  I'm not sure the K thinks this either, becuase she seems to have her terminology a bit off on 119 and 120.  She seems to refer to social evolutionists as ""progressivists"" and the ideas as ""progressivism.""  She says that Kroeber ""tried to distnacehimself from progressivism,"" but what It hink she means there is really social evolutioinism.  Later she tries to specy by saying that he was opposed to ""what I would like to call racist hereditarianism."" (120)--by which I think she means social evolutionism because a little father down the page she says that Spencer exemplified this set of ideas.</p>
<p>Rightly, though, she ntoes taht Kroeber accepted a ""hereditarian basis for human existence"" because he assumed inborn differences and a capacity for ""civilization."" (120, bottom)</p>
<p>K also notes that Krober imagined that the rift between biology and culture should be reinforced institutioanlly by a divide between biologists and social scientists and this connects with her observations in the first seciton that this was taking place within the competetive framework of professions.  The most interesting point here though is that in fact there was a biologist and Columbia, a geneticist, who recognized th gap as well: Thom H. Morgan who in a 1924 paper called ""Human Inheritance"" and thn in a book called <em>The Scientific Basis of Evolution</em> talked about social evolution and its ""peculiar process of 'social and economic inheritance.'""  He did so saying that this idea shoud replace the notion of Lamarkian inheritance.  Social inheritance she says was ""functionally equivalent"" to Lamarkianism because efforst to learn are heritable...</p>
<p><strong>Part 2 of her argument:</strong></p>
<p>The next part of K's argument has to do with a set of distinctions she wants to make in relation to the way in which the term culture was being used by Tylor, Boas, and finally Kroeber.  All of these distinctiosn rest on a logical distinction between an <em>explanandum </em>and <em>explanans</em>.  These ideas are commin in philosophy of sceicen she says and were introduced by Hempel and Oppenheim in a 1948  book in their attempt tod describe ""deductive-nomonological"" explanation.  Her description of these categoreis is supremely confusing, but it appears taht the explanandum means a sentence describing a phenomenon to be explained, whereas the explanans is sentences used to explain or account for a phenomenon.</p>
<p>The argument K makes is that Tylor used culture as a explanandum when he defined that ""complex whole"".  Boas shes says, in speaking of culture as a kind of environmental factor produing ""socail causes,"" treated it as a explanans.  Kroeber then returns it to being an explanandum, but she says of a different sort, when he describes it as a new sort of heredity.  She hits this point really hard, accusing Stocking, Degler, and Cravens of not appreciating this crucial distinction.  Here is her argument:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although the early Kroeber thoguht that culture is also the only <em>explanans </em>for culture as <em>explanandum</em> (only culture explains culture), the late Kroeber admitted that many factors are involved in brining about the inter-individual system of change and inheritance he called culture.  That Kroeber weanted to distinguish his concept of culture from that of Boas is also evident from Kroeber/Kluckhohn (1952), a review of varioius definitions and concepts of culture for which the two authors later became famous.  They place Boas together with Tylor into the category of 'descriptive' definitions that use enumerations, and Kroeber into this one and into a second category of 'historical' definitions: definitions with 'empahsis on social heritage'.  My assertionis that the classification offered in 1952, is not revisionary with respect to Tylor's, Boas's,a nd Kroeber's concept of culture; it mathces the original intentions of the early papers under discussion here. (124)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She then hedges her claim by saying that the shift was not that clear and that of course each thinker used both forms of talking about culture, but she's interested in what was ""fundamental"" to their approach. She seems to think that the importance of this insight is that it reveals that Stocking, say, was wrong in arguign that culture provided a ""functionally equivalent subsitute for the older idea of 'race-temperament.'  It explained all the same phenomena, but it did so in strictly non-biological terms, andindeed its full efficacy as an explanaotory concept depended on the rjection of the inheritance of accquried characteristics."" (quoted on 125)  She thinks this is ""misleading"" because it assumes that Boas and Kroeberhad the same concept of culture (she rightly notes that Boas was more skeptical) and then (circularlly!) she says it was misleading because Kroeber's explained different phenomenon because it had ""changed its theoretical role from <em>explanans </em>to <em>explanandum</em>."" (125)</p>
<p>It's very hard to see waht she's saying here!!  I venture that it is something like this: Boas is reluctant to envision a cultural system...but uses culture in a vague way to explain other phenomena.  As she says, he speaks of ""social causes""...Kroeber on the other hand defines a mechanism which itself must be explained, and in doing so he imagines a process that paralells hereditary transmission biologically.</p>
<p>She seems to think of Kroeber as having generated a crucial innovation that Stocking et al overlook which is  precursor to curent multiple-inheritance theorists and in general those who look at ""th einteraction between biolgoical evolution and cultural change."" (125)  For multiple-iinheritance theorists she says that culture is both explanans and explanandum...and agian she says that ""separate second system of inheritance of ideational units that can and needs to be studied in its own right.""

Other women seemed freer to explore lesbian relatoinships as is suggested by bio accounts of Jeannette Mraks, Mary Wooley, M. Carey Thomas and Mary Garrett, see f.n. #24.

"Creating a Female Dominion in American Reform, 1890-1935","p.020-22  Creation of Female Professional Culture

Beginning in 1890.  They created a distinct profssional culture because""women entered the professional world most successfully when they carved out wholly new areas of expertise in which they did not compete with men for jobs or training."" (20) INcomes for these professional also -- because they served children and poor women -- came from wealthy patron and not from their clientelle.  That means they had to convinced both their clients and their patrons of the importance of their work.  Muncy alsoargues that women'sprofessioanl culture sought to ""coopeartion of lay people"" at a timew hen male professions were ""seeking to increase their feesand status by emphasizing their estoric knowledge..."" (20)   This meant also that women did a lot of popularizing, and Muncy notes that research hasshown that even earlier in the 19th century women had perfromed a popularizing role in relation to scientific knowledge.  ""The persistence of this inclinations suggeststhat the educating role suited Victorian ideals of womanhood.  The cult of true womanhood had envisioned women as the healers of divisions in communities.  By popularizing technicalknowledg,women were fulfilling their obligation to pull groups together, to heal the divisions between the educated and the uneducated, between professionals and potential clients, between elite and mass."" (21)  But she notes that men were also forced to popularize -- particularly journalists -- so it was not exclusively a female realm, but for female professions this was a ""defining characteristic"" (21).
Also female professionalism defined by a ""professional ethos""that valued self-sacrifice, in excess of the same among male professionals for whom the ethic of service was vague, requiring as a historianshe quotes notes simply ""competent performance"" (22) (21-22).  Parlty the emphasis on service came from the peculiar circumstances of women: they needed to demonstrate the service ethic becausetheir wealthy patrons were not interested in supporting professionals but rather providing aid to the poor.

'Race' Speech: 'Culture' Speech: 'Soul' Speech: The Brief Career of Social-Science Language in American Religion During the Fascist Era,"00 Summary 00

This article examines the usage of social-scientific language relating to culture in American religion during the 30s.  She traces it in relation to a certain language that developed.  For instance at the National Conference of chiastian and Jews: ""As the contributors their faiths as 'a way of life,' they downplayed divisive creeds.  Most important, these were 'religions,' not races, and, indeed, religions anthropologically conceived as sets of customs.  The terms 'democracy,' 'individual,' faith,' and 'religion' all lined up neatly with social meanings and conveyed the wish of religious liberals for hamrony, not just among denominations but between sacred and secular interests."" (88) Ultimately, however, much like Hegeman & Susman, Rose concludes that in this context culture 1) failed to exclude or fully replace deterministic (even racially deterministic) language(e.g. p.90), and 2) ""that the notion of democratic faiths courted equal if opposite dangers of conformism and ostracism."" (92)   After World War II, then, there was a new
enthusiasm for discovering religious difference.  ""After the search beginning in the 1920s for what was common and comparable in religion, Americans indulged a wish for spiritual self-expression.  These writers spoke as if religions serving the public good required too much neglect of remembered differences and offered too little access to the inward or transcendent.  They wanted faiths with a 'soul,' that inner nub of peculiarity able to anchor and transform identity.  It is impossible to prove--though important to suggests--that this longing for selfhood , revealed in speech, was a key force behind the well-known postwar revival. The people who built, joined, and attended congregations in numbers unprecedented in the twentieth century seemed to act out the meaning of words calling for rcover of religious foundations."" (95)  She illustrates this in partiuclar using Will Herberg's ""Protestant--Catholic--Jew"" (1955).  ""...the book also contained a prophetic voice that made iti an insistent jeremiad.  In these portions, social-science words changed from descriptions to accusations.  Americans practiced a 'culture-religion' that idolatrously made democracy its object and used the  'cult of faith' in fatih as a therapeutic crutch.  Herberg rejected this spirit of  accomodation and instead named 'biblical faith' the standard of value."" (96)  Toward the end of the article, however, Rose suggests that the experience of how ""successive social-theory influenced faith must also have underlined the variability and indeed relativism of pious words."" (96)"
"The Decline of the German Mandarins:  The German Academic Community, 1890-1933","<p>p.097-102 German Historical Tradition</p>
<p>Stemming from Leopold von Ranke (1795-1886).  HIs method was set in opposition ot the ""intellectual tendences in the West European Enlightenment."" (98)</p>
<p>""As German scholars saw it, the historian's greatest sin was to trea tthe past as a collection of examples to be used to glorify man, progress, and the present, to construct general maxims of statecraft, or to chart the advances of science and reason. "" (98)</p>
<p>Ringer is carefult  point out that the German historians did not intend to ban all generalization.  ""No German historian ever took such a position,"" he says.  (98)  The goal was to be ""historical"" by describing ""bygone epochs, institutions, and individuals as much as possible 'in their own terms'..."" (98)</p>
<p>It relied on the practice of empathy that allowed one to put themselves inthe palce of ""historic individuals."" (98) So it led to the principle of ""individuality"" that could be applied to all subjects.  One regarded each historical object as unique, whether a particualr ruler or a epoch or a state.    ONe reconstruted these individualities by drawing upon Dilthey's ""objective geist"" to find the ""suriving 'objectifications' of its spirit."" (99) The hstorian seeks meaning in the ""patterns of thought and behavior"" but not necessarily in the ""historical process as a whole."" (99)  Thus the emphasis is again on the Geist...and the practice of empathy it enabled...even before Hegel (99)</p>
<p>But the principle of individality he notes probalyy owed more to German Romatnicism and to Idealistic systems.  He referes to a 1923 lecture on ""Natural Law and Humanity in World Politics"" by Ernst Troeltsch that described to political traditions: the French and Anglo-American based on a secular verison of Stoci and Christian naturallaow and the ideal of ""humanity,"" and another rootedin that rooted in the Lutheran state that had emphasized the ""authoritarian implications of Christian natural law."" (100)  On this basis he dscribes a product of German Romanticism as the ""new, posivie, ethical, and historical principle"" of ""indivduality."" (100)  Long quote on 100-101, shows this as being tied to a conceptin of the relationship between a gorup and its constituent elements.</p>
<p>""Of decisive importance is the mystical-metaphysical sense of this concept of individudality as in each case a particular concretion of the divine spirit in unique persons and in suprapersonal communal organizations.  The basic constiutents of reality are not similar material and social atoms and universal laws...but differing unique personalities and individualizing formative forces...This results...in a different idea of community: The state and the society are not created from the individual by way of contract and pragmatic [zweckrationale] construction, but from the suprapersonal spiritual forces which emanate from the most important and creative individuals, the volk spirit [Volksgeist] or the religious aesthetic idea.  A quite different idea of humanity also results [from this basic coneption]: not the ultimate union of fundamentally equal human beings in a rationally organized total humanity, but the fullness of contending national spirits, which unfold their highest spiritual powers in this contest...[Further, this approach leads to a conception of historical development as a progression] of qualitatively different cultures, in which the leading nation at a given tiime hands the toch to its successor and in which all [cultures] together in mutual complementaiton represent the totality of life."" (quoted on 101).</p>
<p>I.e. this is the wholistic idea...the whole is not simply the sum of its parts. (101)</p>"
The Philosophy of the Enlightenment,"<p>Notes June 2011</p>
<p>Preface</p>
<p>Cassirer makes it clear in the preface here that he thinks that any account of the Enlightenment that describes it, as he puts it, by ""tracing this development from system to system, from Descartes to Malebranche, from Spinoza to Leibniz, and from Bacon and Hobbes to Locke"" (ix) will fail to capture the point of the Enlightenment as he sees it.&nbsp; So the point he makes over and over again in the book is that the nature or character of this intellectual movement lies in its commitment to questioning and so any account of it needs to capture it ""in process"": ""The fundamental intellectual forces with which we are here concerned can be grasped only in action andin the constantly evolving process ofthought; only in process can the pulation of th inner intellectual life of the Enlightenment be felt.""&nbsp; (ix)</p>
<p>In presenting the Enlightenment through its action, his goal is to resist the most common and he thinks most shallow critique of the Enlightenment: ""that it lacked understanding of the historically distant and foreign, and that in naive overconfidence it set up its own standards as the absolute, and only valid and possible, norm for the evaluation of historical events.""&nbsp; (x)&nbsp; This I think is the German-Romantic critique of the Enlightenment that he is referencing; actually he says so on the next page, saying this is the ""verdict"" of the Romantic movement (xi).&nbsp; He doesn't think that that critique is entirely eroneous, but he seems to think that it has been excessively implied, that in fact the Romantic verdict goes too far.&nbsp; And so he wants to ""silence"" the critique that takes as its target the ""shallow Enlightenment."" (xi)&nbsp;</p>
<p>In making it clear that he thinks some of its critics have too shallowly critiqued the Enlightenment, he also make it clear that he thinks Kant's <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em> has made it ""impossible to return to the questions and answers of the Enlightenment."" (xi)&nbsp; But, he says that once the ""History of Pure Reason"" is written that Kant indicates in his last section of the <em>Critique</em> is written he thinks that ""it will have to recall especially the period which discovered and passionately defended the autonomy of reason, and which firmly established this concept in all fields of knowledge.""&nbsp; (xi)</p>

<p>C starts about my identifying what was unique about the 18th century.&nbsp; He goes through an initial examination of the sense of the 18th century thinkers, e.g. D'Alembert, that there was a distinct intellectual movement afoot.&nbsp; ""Reason"" was the keyword, but what did this mean?&nbsp; He explains first by distinguishing it from what the 17th century had been about the philosophical construction of systems.&nbsp; This is what Descartes, Malebranche, Leibniz and Spinoza had done.&nbsp; Instead, the 18th century ""mind"" he says seeks ""another concept of truth and philosophy whose function is to extend the boundaries of both and make them more elastic, concrete, and vital.""&nbsp; And it uses ""natural science"" as the model for doig this...&nbsp; (7)</p>
<p>A source for this kind of thinking exists in Newton's ""Rules of Philosophizing"" and not Descartes' <em>Discourse on Method</em> says C.&nbsp; Newton didn't start with ""general concepts and axioms""; he began with phenomena and attempted to move toward general principles: ""If the latter are first according to nature...then the former musta always be first to us....Hence the method of physics can never consist in proceeding from any arbitrary <em>a priori</em> starting-point, from a hypothesis, and in completely developing the logical conclusions implicit in it.""&nbsp; (7)&nbsp; Instead, the goal is to investigate patterns in the material world.&nbsp; That is not the dualism of Hume, meaning the fact that ideas and the material world are governed by different rules or that there is a ""cleavage between experience and thinking, that is, between the realm of bare fact and that of pure thought.""&nbsp; (8)&nbsp; For Newton and his followers, instead, the goal was to discover ""universal order and law in the material world.""&nbsp; (8)&nbsp; That meant that material facts are not just a random ""jumble of discrete elements; on the contrary, facts exhibit an all-pervasive form."" (8)</p>
<p>So: ""Observation produces the datum of science; the principle and law are the object of the investigation."" (8)</p>
<p>The thrust here, though, is not toward a love of systems.&nbsp; D'Alembert in his ""Preliminary Discourse"" and Condillac in his <em>Treatise on Systems</em> develop the point that systems are dangerous when not subjected to validation by the phenomena themselves.&nbsp; Condillac, C says, shows that the 17th century systems failed because they were not put to the ""test of historical criticism.""&nbsp; They avoided the ""facts"" and proceeded instead from some central dogma.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now here comes this powerful passage on 8-9 that I mentioend before.&nbsp; He says that the enthusiasm for system is replaced for a ""new alliance between the 'positive' and the 'rational' spirit.""&nbsp; (8)&nbsp; Not sure what that means?&nbsp; The positive that spirit that studies facts and the rational that wants to construct principles?&nbsp; The&nbsp; other way around?&nbsp;</p>
<p>But he breaks it down this way: ""ONe should not seek order, law, and 'reason' as a rule that may be grasped and expressed prior to the phenomena, astheir <em>a priori</em>,; one should rather discover such regularity in the phenomena themselves, as the form of their immanent connection.&nbsp; Nor should one attempt to anticipate from the outset such 'reason' in the form of a closed system; one should rather permit this reason to unfold gradually, with every increasing clarity and perfection, as knowledge of the facts progresses."" (9)&nbsp;</p>
<p>This started to sound Kantian to me because of the emphasis on phenomena, as well as the idea that the form of reason/logic has to be developed through the phenomena rather than a priori -- although is reason in fact <em>a priori</em> for Kant?&nbsp; In any case, C says that the Enlightment rejected the logic of the scholastics as well as the mathemeticians, and sought instead the ""logic of facts.""&nbsp; (9)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He speaks of the Enlightment as demanding that the ""mind abandon itself to the abundance of phenomena and guage itself completely by them"" with a confidence that it will ""not get lost, but that instead it will finder here its own real truth and standard."" (9)&nbsp; In other words, it is only through abandoning itself to the phenomena of experience that the mind can discover its true relationship to the world by achieving a ""genuine correlation of subject and object, of truth and reality...""&nbsp; (9)</p>
<p>Later he points out that in another sense the 18th century is not a radical departure from the 17th century, but a shifting of emphasis.&nbsp; There is still the basic belief--that only Hume's dualism denied--that there is no basic discontinuity between phenomena and principles, the particular or the general--from this ""rationalistic postulate of unity."" (9)&nbsp; As d'Alembert put it: ""All sciences put together...are nothing but human intelligence, which always remains one and the same, and is always identical with itself, however different the objects may be to which it is applied."" (quoted on 23).</p>
<p>The ""absolutism"" of the unity principle C says loses some power and accepts some limitations in the 18th century, but the basic core of the idea remains intact.&nbsp; The goal is still unification: ""To 'know' a manifold of experience is to place its component parts in such a relationship to one another that, starting from a given point, we can run through them according to a constant and general rule."" (23) So to know this ways is also to perform a reduction ""from apparent diversity to its basic identity."" (23)&nbsp; This way of thinking, however, is not without its power--or even in a sense a kind of magical quality--as C I think tries to make clear on the next two pages, describing how this capacity of the mind to discover the fundamental relationships between things allows this way of thinking to move beyond mere ""quantities"" to the world of ""qualities"" because qualities as well as quantities can be placed ""in such a relationshp to one another that they are derviable from one another in a strict order."" (24)&nbsp; For Condillac e.g. in <em>The Language of Calculus</em>, there can no be calculus of pscyhological experience because unlike corporeal substance psychology is not quantifiable, but psychological experience can still be divided into its constituent parts and so is accessible to analytical thought.&nbsp; Condiallac's proof of this is his famous illutration at the center of his psychology where he descrbies how a marble statue ""progressively comes to life and qacquires an incresaingly rich spritiual content because the individual senses engrave their special qualities on the marble.""

<p>Notes June 2011</p>
<p>Preface</p>
<p>Cassirer makes it clear in the preface here that he thinks that any  account of the Enlightenment that describes it, as he puts it, by  ""tracing this development from system to system, from Descartes to  Malebranche, from Spinoza to Leibniz, and from Bacon and Hobbes to  Locke"" (ix) will fail to capture the point of the Enlightenment as he  sees it.&nbsp; So the point he makes over and over again in the book is that  the nature or character of this intellectual movement lies in its  commitment to questioning and so any account of it needs to capture it  ""in process"": ""The fundamental intellectual forces with which we are  here concerned can be grasped only in action andin the constantly  evolving process ofthought; only in process can the pulation of th inner  intellectual life of the Enlightenment be felt.""&nbsp; (ix)</p>
<p>In presenting the Enlightenment through its action, his goal is to  resist the most common and he thinks most shallow critique of the  Enlightenment: ""that it lacked understanding of the historically distant  and foreign, and that in naive overconfidence it set up its own  standards as the absolute, and only valid and possible, norm for the  evaluation of historical events.""&nbsp; (x)&nbsp; This I think is the  German-Romantic critique of the Enlightenment that he is referencing;  actually he says so on the next page, saying this is the ""verdict"" of  the Romantic movement (xi).&nbsp; He doesn't think that that critique is  entirely eroneous, but he seems to think that it has been excessively  implied, that in fact the Romantic verdict goes too far.&nbsp; And so he  wants to ""silence"" the critique that takes as its target the ""shallow  Enlightenment."" (xi)&nbsp;</p>
<p>In making it clear that he thinks some of its critics have too  shallowly critiqued the Enlightenment, he also make it clear that he  thinks Kant's <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em> has made it ""impossible  to return to the questions and answers of the Enlightenment."" (xi)&nbsp; But,  he says that once the ""History of Pure Reason"" is written that Kant  indicates in his last section of the <em>Critique</em> is written he  thinks that ""it will have to recall especially the period which  discovered and passionately defended the autonomy of reason, and which  firmly established this concept in all fields of knowledge.""&nbsp; (xi)</p>
<p>This mention of Kant is interesting because I think Cassirer belonged  to the group of German thinkers that are sometimes described as  neo-Kantian after the 1870s.&nbsp; Also as I've read through the first two  chapters, I've noticed what may be a tendency in Casirrer to want to  read a Kantian understanding of the interplay of reason and experience  into the Enlightenment, so perhaps in this account he is reading the  history of the Enligthenment through a Kantian lens??&nbsp; I will point out  examples of what I mean in these notes, but here's just one.&nbsp; See pp.  8-9, where he describes why the Enlightenment was not interested in  systems for sytems sake, because it sought to ""discover...regularity in  the phenomena thesmelves...""&nbsp; This for me--with my shallow understanding  of Kant from reading just parts of the Introduction to the <em>Critique--</em>Kant's  understanding of the limits of reason, that it can only know things as  they appear in experience, but that at this same time the sense that  reason follows certain rules that make it possible to discover  regularity in the world...&nbsp;&nbsp; I will point out other instances of this  later...Note: I showed the passage on pp. 8-9 to Brian and he verified  that Cassirer seemed to be using Kant's categories, but that somehow it  was also ""filtered through Hegel...,"" but I couldn't get him to explain  what that meant.</p>
<p>Chapter 1: The Mind of the Enligthenment</p>

<p>""The mind neither creates nor invents; it repeats and constructs.&nbsp; But in this repetition it can exhibit almost inexhaustible powers.&nbsp; It extends the visible universe beyond all bounds; it traverses the infinity of space and time; and yet it i unceasingly engaged in the production of ever new shapes within itself.&nbsp; iBut throughout its activities the mind is concerned only with itself and its 'simple ideas.'&nbsp; These constitute the solid ground on which the entire edifice constructed by the mind, both in its 'external' and in its 'internal' aspects, rests--and from which the mind can never depart."" (25)</p>
<p>C describes how Condillac's attempt to ""show that all psychological reality is a transformation, a metamorphosis"" is continued by Helvetius in his book <em>On the Mind,</em>which he clearly does not like and does not think is a good representative account of 18th century thought, except in that it describes the same ""methodology"" which finds sensation to be the basis of all thought (and ethical judgement etc)--only I think C dislikes C because he's toooo reductive and narrow minded--the kind of thinker who is represedntative of the ""shallow Enlighenment.""

Madden explains it in terms of the ""vaguenss"" of Boas' proposals: ""His proposals to the Rockefeller Foundation and the Social Science Research Council were vague and did not convey a coherent research enterprise.  Since the leaders of both organizations wished to fund research dedicated to specific social problems, Boas' proposals meet a critical audience at the funding organizations."" (19-20)

It shares the extreme individualism of negative liberty, defining itself in terms of absolute freedom from any influence of others, and at the same time the extreme sense of self-control that often characterizes positive liberty, the notion of a rational, reflective, self-ruling agent who is concerned not just to choose but to make the best choice, the right choice.""

Women in Early American Anthropology,"p. 054 - 68 Matilda Stevenson

-- Matilda Stevenson also worked in Zuni, but she was agressive and O-L accuses her of being responsible for ""some of the hostility toward anthropologists that continues in the Southwestern pueblos."" (55) 

-- Stevenson distresse dby ""commericalism"" in among the Zuni (55)

-- Stevenson became an ""anthropologist by marriage"" to James Stenevenson.  Matilda vorn Matilda Evans in Texas in 1850.  James Stevenson worked as a geologist for the U.S. Geological Survey.  In 1879 she went with him on an anthropological expedition that included Fran H. Cushing and J.K. Hillers.   They remainedin Zuni for 6 months ( 56) 

-- Stevenson organized a cleaning service in Zuni and chose a transvestite named We'-wha.  (56-57)

-- Recognized by E.B. Tylor in his 1881 speach to the Anth. Ass. in Washington., though she had already pub. a thirty-five page study of Zuni and the Zunians privately.  in 1881.  (58)

-- She ""concentrated purposefully on affairs concerning women and children in the belief that as a woman she could obtain particularly complete information, a point tha tifgured in the philosophy of the Women's Anthropological Society founded and first presided over by Matidla Stevenson."" (58)

-- Once she nursed W. H. Holmes through an illness in the field and he recalled her as ""able, self-reliant, and fearless, generous, helpful and self-sacrificing."" (59) (58-59)  [Note: interesting mixture of male and female traits.]

-- She was not as taken in by the Zuni as Alice Fletcher (see 55) and she took data from the Zuni even when they didn't want her to.  Seh sketched things secretly even when they had tole her thatey ""feared having things 'carried away on paper'"" (59)  And once she was held prisoner in a Kiva at the Hopie pueblo of Oraibi until resuced.  This event was reported in the Illustrated Police News of March 6, 1886 in a way to denegrate the maliness of Indians.  The headline was: ""Cowed by a AWoman: A Craven Red Devel Weakins in the Face of a Resolute White Heroine.""  (59)  (59-60).  Also see illustration at end of documentof Stevenson shaking her fist in the scared Hopi man's face.

Ruth Benedict and the Modernist Sensibility,"p.123 Handler sets Sapir against Benedict interms of the individual v. culture tension.  I think Handler is a bit off on his treatment of the core of Benedict's ideas.  He for instance describes in this introduction that ""Pound is to Eliot as Sapir is to Benedict.  Put less cryptically, the contrast between Pound's iconoclasm and Eliot's Catholicism is similar to that between Sapir's emphaiss on the individual and Benedict's championing of culture."" (123)  But I think it is reductive in the wrong direction to say that Benedict ""championed"" culture.  If she saw culture as determinative, this was not necessarily to champion it, and we must ask why she tended to see it as determinative.  Handler is aware of gender but he doesn't seem to consider the significance of gender in Benedict's tendency to see culture as determinative."
The Other Within: The Marranos: Split Identity and Emerging Modernity,
American Moderns: Bohemian New York and the Creation of a New Century,"p. 302 - 304 Dramatic Adoption of Fee Love Sex Talk	

Stansell discusses here the adoption of what she has described earlier in this chapter ""Talking about Sex"" as sex talk among and popularity of free love ideology among New York Bohemians.

It was first present she says in Floyd Dell's ""he said, she said"" format plays for the Liberal Club Players which he founded in 1913, a group he formed based on exp. with the idea of the Little Theater in Jackson Park.   Stansell describes it this way: ""...Dell took lovers' quarrels, men's promiscuity, women's resentments, and the difficulties of marriage and staged it all at the Liberal Club, mostly as a farce.  Some of the plays were thematic and ideological, fleshed out with speeches ont he inevitable failure of monogamy and the death of love in marriage--not so different form an Emma Goldman lecture.  Others were self/mocking treatments of what Dell referred to as 'everybody's private affairs.'"" (301)

S thinks these plays ""replicated the openness and purported symmetry of the free-love dialogue."" (301) But it also mocked it: ""The self-dramatics of free love turn out to be as flimy as Liberal Club produtions..."" (302) She notes that ""heterosexual honesty"" became in its failures the thing that drvoe the plots.  (302)

She notes that this ""theater of sex"" had little to do with Freud at this stage., i.e. before 1920.  The focus on sex behavior she notes had a root in a focus esp. on womens' problems (hysteria still powerful here) and mixed gynecology and advice.     (302)

More serious focus grew out of Lieberal Club Players in 1916 when a group hanging out in Provincetown on Cape Cod ""decided to replicate their Manhattan venture with a greater degree of seriousness."" (302) Involved were Eugene O'Neil, Mabel Dodge, Hapgood and Boyce and John Reed....   

Her conclusion here is that these plays revealed a tension between bohemian men and women, in which men dominated with their talk.  After quoting Boyce's role in a play written by Boyce and Hapgood, in which Boyce talks about how Hapgood had crushed her soul, Stansell writes: ""Pent-up energies were at work, an alternative understanding of the marriage and Boyce's own role in it that had long been suppressed by the pressures of bohemian ideology.""

Occidentalism: the West in the eyes of its enemies,"<p>Notes Winter 2014</p>
<p>### War Against the West</p>
<p>This is a book claiming to trace something like what Said traced regarding the idea of the Orient, but for the Occident, the West, which is also identified with the ""modern"" or ""modernity"" but also ""colonialism"" and ""capitalism."" The target is slippery.</p>
<p>* The authors start the intro with a group of Japanese intellectuals who met in 1942 to discuss how to ""overcome the modern."" But they insist that this discourse has a much broader history and that it has become more and more inspirational to more people, especially radical Muslims. (4-5). The U.S. also has become a symbol of this, say, for muslims (5).</p>
<p>* It is not about left/right (5). It's broader than that. The people who fall into this pattern of thinking they are calling ""Occidentalism"" do so for different reasons, and don't necessary share much. I.e. a romantic who hates modern, commercial metropolises does not have much in common with a religious radical: one seeks a ""pastoral arcadia"", the other a kingdom of God. (5) And so on.</p>
<p>* So in defining their topic more specifically they say these more piecemeal likes and dislieks is not their target. They use the language of pathology and disease: ""Symptoms become interesting only when they develop into a full-blown disease."" (5) I.e. they are not interestedin those who simply do not like pop culture or global capitalism or what have you. What they are interested in is the ""desire to declare a war on the West for such a reason..."" (5) What they call Occidentalism is ""[t]he dehumanizing picture of the West painted by its enemies..."" (5) They call it a ""cluster of prejudices"" and they want to trace their ""historical roots."" (5-6)</p>
<p>* They insist that it is clear that this is anot a particular Islamic problem. (6) Again here they use the language of disease, i.e. ""occidentalism cannot be reduced to a Middle Eastern sicknes..."" (6)</p>
<p>* They argue that it was born in Europe before it was transferred elsewhere. (6)</p>
<p>* vv Anti-Americanism: anti-Americanis plays a key role in Occidentalism, but they insist on 9 that it is only a part. The two are not the same thing. America seems to be a symbol of the machine-like and soulless. But it's not always the Americans that representthis, for example the German Jews were viewed by Eastern Jews in a similar way, as cold and soulless. (I'm thinking of Joseph Roth's characterization!) (9-10)</p>
<p>* They refer to Occidentalism as a ""venemous brew"" (10)</p>
<p>* What they are interested in critiquing is the ""dehumanization"" that is involved in Occidentalism as much as Orientalism, the reduction of a whole set of people to being soulless etc. They are also not interested in mere ""prejudices"" but a set of ideas that has developed ""revolutionary force"" (11)</p>
<p>* They note that one way to trace this tradition would b ""to trace the history of all its links and overlaps, from the Counter-Reformation to the Counter-Enlightenment in Europe, to the many varieties of fascism and national socialism in East and West, to anticapitalism and antiglobalization, and finally to the religious extremism that rages in so many places today."" (11) But they won't do that because of the need for concision, so they have chosen instead to avoid this chrnological appraoch and to instead identify partiuclar ""strands"" that are linked to a ""chain of hostility"". These strands are: hostility to the city, to the ""mind of the West,"" to the bourgeois, to the infidel... (11)</p>

<p>### Seeds of Revolution (conclusion)</p>
<p>* Authors start with a novel by Herzel of all peopel that envisions a socialist Jewish utopia in which Arabas and Jews live side by side, all happy because the benefits of Enlightenment rationality, modernity, and modernization have made everything better. Then they authors talk about the resistance to this. It has not always taken the same form but they make a big deal of the way those who have opposed this ""Western"" modern thing have done so with ideas tht originated in Europe. Iranian revolutionary Ali Ahsari'ati spent timein Paris translating Frantz Fanon and Che Guevara. He interpreted Islam as ""pracical socialism."" (145) Ba'athism, the ideology of the Syrian and former Iraqi govenrments, came to life int he 1930s and 1940s in tehw ake of collapse of the Ottoman Epire forged by Sati' Husri and Michel 'Aflaq. Husri had read the German Romantics, Fichte and Herder, drew on their notion of a voelkish nation. (145-6). He used the idea of asabiyya drawn from the 14th century thinker Ibn Khaldun. (146) Even Zionists such as Hans Kohn in his his memoir noted drawing inspiration from Fichte !!! (146)</p>
<p>* Then in the last pages, dissapointingly, they move the question to how to ""protect the idea of the West--that is to say, the world's liberal democracies--against its enemeies."" (147).&nbsp; I really don't like this turn. Why raise this issue this way? It jsut seems simplistic. But they mean it. They see a kind of war of ideas going on, not a war of civlizations. They describe a ""worldwide, loosely organized, mostly underground revolutionary movement."" (147) But they don't think it's about national, ethnic, or religious borders; they think it is&nbsp; ""in some respects the same as the one that was fought several generations ago against various versions of fascism and state socialism.""

Transcritique: On Kant and Marx,"<p>Notes 7/2014:</p>
<p>## Preface</p>
<p>The book is a reflection on Kant and Marx. Usually, Marx is read in connection to Hegel; he came to think that Marx should be read in connection with Kant. There is a kind of Kantian Marxism that has been lost. It is not without its weaknesses. It is admirable because of its strong sense of ethics, but it is weak in its sense of its sense of ""th eforces of the social relations that compel people."" (ix) It is in this sense a bit anarchistic, and that's what K originally liked about it; his politics being a bit anarchistic. So Marx is neccessary.</p>
<p>The connection with Marx is a hard one to see righta way. He thinks capital is not simply a book critiquing classical economics, and economy. It is a ""project that elucidates the nature and limits of capital's drive [<em>Trieb</em>], and furthermore reveals, on the basis of that drive, an essential difficulty ential in the human act of exchange (or more broadly, communication.) Capital does not offer an easy exist; rather only by its very exitlessness does it suggest a possibilty of practical intervention."" (ix)</p>
<p>The link to Kant seems to be that he started to see Kant as somone who in seeking to reveal the *limits* of morality, also revealed a ""possiblity of practice."" (ix) It seems he thinks that Kant is more forward-looking than Marx, who spoke very little of communism, i..e offered no out. Is that what Kant offers to Karatani? He says up until 1989 he was also not incline to hink of futures, but after 1989 that seemed more necessary. (ix)</p>
<p>Now in the 1980s hthere was a revival of Kant in works by Arendtd, Lyotard and Habermas, who turned it to a ""communicative rationality."" The point taken he says was that ""'universality'--a sine qua non for the judgement of taste--cannot be achieved, in reality, among a multitude of conflicting subjects."" (x) This was of course not Kant's point, because he ""assumed a transcendental subjectivity that watches over universality."" (x) So what was this return, well it was a ""criticsm of communism qua 'metaphysics'"". (x) And this of course was part of the broader push for deconstruction etc that happened in the wake of Stalinism. So: ""the reexamination of Marxism has involved public conssensus and negotation among multiple language games as opposed to the central control of reason, and heterogenity of experience or complexity of causality as opposed to a rationalist (metaphysical) view of history; on the other hand, the present, which has hitherto been sacrificed by telos, is reaffirmed in its qualitative heterogeneity (or in the sense of Bergsonian duration.)"" (x) He says he too was part of this. He realized later that it only had critical impact only while ""Marxism actually ruled the poeple of many nation-states."" (x) In the 1990s that was not the case anymore. So once that was no longer the case: ""Skeptical relativism, multiple language games (or public consesnsu), aesthetic affirmation fo the present, empriical historicism, appreciation of subcultures (or cultural studies), and so forth lost their most subversive potenticess an dhence bamce th edominant, ruling thought."" (xi)</p>
<p>## Introduction</p>
<p>* What's transcritique? He starts with Kant. Basically, Kant wanted to move from the view within one's own subjectivity to the view of another's. This produces what Kant calls in *Dreams of a Visionary* a ""pronounced parallax"" . He sees thisas the only way of ""prevenint the optical delusion, and of putting the concept of the power of knowledge in huma nnature into its true place."" (1) Karatani connects this to Marx, who critqiued the Hegelian's in German Ideology -- that Karatani says Marx came to see as only an attempt to create ideally what England had created materially -- and then moving to England, where he experienced a ""pronounced parallax"" that brought him into contact with ""the reality thatis exposed through difference (parallax)."" (3) The reason that Karatani wants to think of Marx in connection with Kant is because of this subjective shift, this pronoucned parallax. He explains in this quote:</p>
<p>&gt; What is important is the fact that Marx's critique was always born from migration and the pronounced parallax that results form it. Hegel criticized Kant's subjectivism and emphasized objectivity. But in Hegel, the pronoucned parallax discovered by Kant is extinguished. Likewise, the pronounced parallax discovereed by Marx was extinguished by Engels and other Marxists. As a result, one is left with an image of Kant&nbsp; and Marx as thinkers who constructed solid immovable systems.&nbsp; A closer reading, however, revelas that they were in fact practicing constant transposition, and thta the move to different discursive systems was what brought about the proncounced parallax. This is obvious in the case of the exiled Marx, but the same thing can be observed in Kant as well. Kant wasa not an exile in spatial terms--he never moved away from his hometown of Koenigsberg. Rather, it was his stance that made him a kind of exile, a man indepednent from the state: Kant rejected a promotion to a post in Berlin, the center of state academia, instead insisting on cosmopolitanism. Kant is generally understood to have executed the transcendental critique from a plaece that lies between rationalism and empiricism. However, upon reading his strangely self-deprecating *Dreams of a Vision Explained by Dreams of Metaphysics*, one finds it impossible to say that he was simply thinking from a place between these two poles. Instead, it is the ""parallax"" between positons that acts. Kant, too, performed a critical osciallation: He continuously confronted the dominant rationalism with empiricism, and the dominant empiricism with rationalism. The Kantian critique exists within this moment itself. The transcendental critqiue is not some kind of stable third position. It cannot exist without a transverasal and transpositional movement. It is for this reason that I have chosen to name the dynamic critqiuqes of kant and Marx -- which are both transcendental and transversal --""transcritique"". (3-4)</p>
<p>* So where does this go: it goes to the critique of value it seems. In Karatani, Engels is a ""historical mateiralist"", but Marx is not that, he's more(3-4). The critique of value is key here, a turn that Marx took in the middle of his career in the move from *Grundrisse* to *Capital*. What provoked the shift Karatani says was his introduction to ""skepticism"" in the form of Bailey's critique of Ricardo's labor theory fo value, i.e. the idea that the value of a commodity ""eixsts only in its relationship with other commodities,a dnt ehere fore the labor value that Ricardo insists is inherent in a commodity is an illusion."" (5) Karatani compares Bailey's skepticism vv labor theory of value to Hume's critique of the Carteasian ego cogito that so provoked Kant. Kat's answer to Hume's claim that there was no such ego was: ""...yes, an ego is just an illusion, but functioning there is the transcendental apperception X. But whaat one knows as metaphysics is that which consdiers the X as soemthing substantial. Nevertheless, one cannot really escape from the drive [Trieb] to it it as an empirical substance in various contexts. If so, it is possible to say that an ego is not just an illusion, but a transcendental illusion."" (6) Marx, like Kant, must have been similarly stricken by Bailey Karatni thinks, and yet he too moved in a unique direction, i.e. not toward one side or the other, but toward what K calls the ""transcendental reflection on value."" (6) </p>
<p>* So what is this ""transcendental reflection on value."" Karatani quickly describes it from 6 onward. Classical economics treated comodoties as if they had an inherent value, an internalized ""labor value."" But they don't: ""in raelity, commodities can have values only after their relationship is synthesized by money, and each one of them is given its value."" (6) This was Bailey's point. But Bailey did not why it is that these commodities are related to each other in the way that they are; he didn't question the system that achieved this. From Marx's point of view, then, both Ricardo and Bailey didn't go to this deeper level. Bailey only erased moeny superficially. He criticized both Bailey and Ricardo in order to elucidate a ""*form* that constitutes the commodity economy."" (6)&nbsp; He focused then on the ""relational system i which objects are placed."" (7)</p>
<p>* Historical materialists here also make the same mistake: they analyze the relationships between nature and humans, but they lack any analysis of the ""capitalist economy that organizes the tansformation/development"" of that realtionship between nature and humans. (7)</p>
<p>* In order to do this, then, to think of value in this way on emust ""take into consdieration the dimension of exchange, and why exchanage inexorably takes the form of&nbsp; value."" (7) </p>
<p>* Karatani in fact really pillories the position he attributes to historical materialists and to Engels as an extension of classical economic thought. Classical economists he insisits ""had the conviction that they could see all aspects of sociial relations transparently from the vantage point of production."" (8) They allowed ""social exchange"" to remain ""opaque"", as something that just was and could thus not be changed or abolished. They ignored the ways in which it was constituted as a form by commodity exchange it he capitalist system. Engels continues this as far as Karatani is concerned. ""Engels' conviction that we should control the anarachic drive of capitalist prodcution and transform it into a planned economy was little more than an extension of classical economists' thought. And Engels's stance was, of cousre, the source of centralist communism."" (8) </p>

Lost Manhood Found: Male Sexual Impotence and Victorian Culture in the United States,"p. 47 - 52  Crisis of Masculinity and Pscyhological Turn in 1920s

Mumford sees this as a product of sexual and not gendered crisis.  As Beard's work indicated: ""By the late ninteenth century, the regime of male continence had become part and parcel of late Victorian respectability.  But middle-class men's achievement of civilized self-restraint seemed to signify more their social superiority than their attainment of manhood."" (48) 

There occured then a reaction against Beardian science c. 1910.  Mumford write s that a survey of scientific literature between 1910 and 1930 shows that a ""scientific concensus on what caused impotence and how to treat it was shifting gradually away from a Beardian model of scarcity, depletion, and saving toward a psychological model of abundance repression and spending."" (49)   So a new focus on ""psychic impotence"" (49).   By 1920s he says a new ""psychological theory of impotence had overtaken the theory of neurasthenia."" (50)  E.g. new attitudes about masturbation, not seein git as depleting.  New focus on sexual release and expression.  Freud's critiqued Beard  in 1908 ""Sexual Morlaity and Modern Nervousness.""  psychoanalyst Wilhelm Stekel in 1920 totally rejected continence. (51)."
Beyond Separate Spheres: Intellectual Roots of Modern Feminism,"<p>p.068-  Helen Thompson's Research on Sex difference...</p>
<p>Summation of existing beliefs at the time about mental traits of sex, based on Thompson's literature survey.  (69-71).  Basically, the cellular theory, and what Thompson did was to point out the contradictions.  ""Women are said to repsenent concentration, patience, and stability in emotional life.  One might logically conclude that prolongedconcentration of attention and unbiased generalization would be their intellectual characteristics.  But these are the very characteristics assigned to men.  Women, though more stable in their emotions, are more influenced by them, and, although the represent patience and concentration, they are incapalbe of prolonged effort."" (quoted on 70).  And she noted that if the role of anabolic egg and katabolic sperm then the arguments of evolutionsists would hav ebeen better served: ""In that case, the female cell, smaller and more agile than the male, would represent woman with her smaller size, her excitable nervous system, and her incapacity for sustained effort of attention; while the male cell, large, calm, and self-contained, would image the size and strength, the impartial reason, and the easy concentration of men."" (70)   For her study then, Thompson chose fifty Chicago undergrads.  Then in german experimental tradition, she testsed them for different motor skills: reaction times, auditory and visiual, rapidity of finger movement, ability to strike a target, pain threshold, ability to discriminate between hot and cold.  What she found overall was that the differences were slight. (71-72).  She dreww these conclusions partly because she drew on Galton's method of graphing the differences and examining the distribution.  (72)   Clark Wissler who was working in Cattell's lab at Columbia, and also using Galton's distribution analsysis as well as the attempt to find correlations, drew conclusoins that supported Thompson: namely that differences in reaction times etc could not be used as the basis for classificationsof mental ability. (72-73).  Wissler did not explicitly examine sex difference, but he noted that the exististing tests of reaction time wouldn't shed light on the matter.  (73)    Thompson had to devise her own tests then.  She drew on work by Mary Calkins at Wellesley  Calkins had wnated to prove HUme and the associationists right.  She had demonstrated it in relation to sex along with Joseph Jastrow at Wisconsin by asking women to right one hudnred words down as rapidly as possible.  Jastrow fond that the women shoed a ""strong preference of the feminine mind ofr certain concrete and familiar classes of words."" (quoted on 74).    But Calkins argued that ""such associations were produced by haibt and did not derive from innate predisposition..."" (Rosenberg's words 74).    Thompson sided with Calkins but Rosenberg notes she found ""the technical prolems ofconvincing the jastrow doubters insurmountable."" (75)  But the problem was more than technical Rosenberg also notes: it had to do with the underlying assumptions about the nature of the differences tht might exist: were they learned or innate?  (75)   thompson tried to get at this but could not. She regularly found differences that she then dismissed based on the learned skills that men or women might hav egained.  E..g men were better at puzzles b/c of the emphasis on mechanical ability.  (75).  Thompson fell down on the side of trained ability influencing the reuslts see 79-80.</p>"
A category of the human mind: the notion of person; the notion of self,"p. 20-22 Person as Category and consciouesness, ""psychological being""

So the next step which he thinks is taken in the modern era was to be coceived as a category.  Here it is then make clear and more specific, ""becoming identified with self-knowledge and the psychological consciousness."" (20) 

He discusses ongoing discussions until 17th and 18th centuries ""about ""knowing whtheer the individual soul is a substance, or supported by a substance: whether it is the nature of man, or whether it is only one of the two natures of man; whether it is one and individual, or divisialbe and separable; whether it is free, the absolute source of all action, o rwhether it is determined fettered by other destinies, by predestination."" (20) 

Important he says were the ""sectarian movmeents"" i.e. the Moravian Brothers, the Puritans, the Wesleyans, and the Pietists that helped conceptualize the person as ""only consciousness"" (21) ""...the 'person'...equals the 'self' (moi); the 'self' (moi) equals consciousness, and is its primordial category."" (21) 

He says this is not very old  Required Hume talking about soul as only ""'states of consciousness', 'perceptions.'"" (22)  But Hume hesitated to make self the ""basic category of conscoiusness"" (22).  He thinks it is with Kant, pietist, that the ""individisble"" self is made clear.  But he think Kant posed the question and then it was answered by Fichte.  (22) Then ""individual conscoiusness"" becomes the ""category of the 'self' (moi), the condition of consciousness and of science, of Pure Reason."" (22)"
"Creating a Female Dominion in American Reform, 1890-1935","0 p.xiv Relationship between Professinalism and Reform

Muncy thinks that ""female professions created during the Progressive era contained as part of their professional creeds many of the commitments of the progressive reformers who gave them birth.""  (xiv)  And as longas they were able to train proteges ""they were able to use their power and patronage tosocialize subsequent generations of women into a common reform culture."" (xiv)  I.e. the female dominion sort of preserved the reform impulse in the professional culture!! 

This leads to a different analysis than the historiography on the relationship between professionalism and progressive era reform suggests: namely, whereas the existing literature ""on feminism correctly blames professionalization for dividing the community of women and distracting professionals from their commitment to public activity on behalf of their sex"" she has found something different.  The female dominion nurtured an ethos of reform to some extent she thinks.  (xiv)  She's not challenging the overall idea that a tension existed between professionalism and reform but that the professionalism was not a monolith and in the female domion such as social work, public health nursing, home economics, and some others professionalism actually ""embraced reform, nurtured it, and cradled it across the 1920s."" (xiv)"
Age of Fracture,"<p>General Thoughts for Discussion with Crisis Group 11/2012</p>
<p>* In the Prologue, R goes lays out the general idea of what he means by fracturing of what he calls at one point the ""strong readings of society"" that ""had been one of the major intellectual projets of the middle decades of the twentieth century."" (4) There is then a language that develops about flexible and dynamic markets, think notions of power, fluid identities, and lots of personal expression. WHAT is the causal factor here? Or does Rodgers feel he needs to provide one? He is providing a very cultural history argument. He insists on 5 ""[t]h terrian of this process was the field of ideas and perception, not, in first instance, society itself."" (5) He uses Robert Putnam's ""Bowling Alone"" thesis to say that when Putnam's argument was critique it turne dout there was still alot of social activity. So society was not he thinks actually thinning (see top of 6) but: ""What changed, across a multitude of fronts, were the ideas and metpahors capable of holding in focus the aggregate aspects of human life as opposed to its smaller, fluid, individual ones."" (6)</p>
<p>Ok then so is this just intellectual, cultural, ideational change? Is it totally disconnected from structural shifts? Between 6-10 he goes through three arguments: 1) A shift to a kind of egotistical selfishness -- what Wolfe called the ""me decade."" 2) The advent of conservative intelelctual to fight a war of ideas backed by powerful institutesion like the Olin Foundation. 3) A STRUCTURAL ARGUMENT, ie. Jameson's argument about late capitalism and postmodernism. But even when he gets to this last structural argument he hedges, not wanting to give economics priority. ""Economies are rooted not only in strutures of echange but also, and just as fundamentally, in ideas, practices, norms, and conventions."" -- i.e. here again is cultural history.Another interestin reference to a structural factor that he sneaks in is on p.2 when he refers to what seem to be shifts in the structural conditions of media circulation: ""Novel forms of intellectual prodcution and dissemination--more politically oriented think tanks, new journals of scholarly debate and opinion, more argumenatively structure media--now began to move ideas more aggressively into circulation."" All this thought and he does not commit to any causal formulation. So one is left with the question, how did this happen?</p>
<p>He refers to the era's diebates as defined by a ""contagion of metaphors"" on 10 and then says also that it was ""an age of such contagions"" -- that is as opposed to concrete or singular ideas. But what made this happen? That is, if this description is accurate? Where's the sense of where this came from and where it's going?</p>
<p>Also I noticed these sentences in Ch.1 on presidential rhetoric where he lists a series of causal/historical sources for the new disaggregated rheotric that has left behind responsbility for dreams and then increasingly indivdiualized and privatized dreams: p. 28 sentence beginning with ""Whether because..."" He's admitting not knowing the distinc tcause, or not wanting to specify.</p>
<p>If pressed, I think he sees this as a cultural/intellectual trend. Ie he notes at the end of his chapter on presidential speech that although Reagan was no intellectual his new lanaguage and style ""was connected to intellectual trends"" that supported his basic thrust...he lists these a bit farther down...these are the main arguments of the book: the increasingly subtle conceptions of power, notions of gender and race that were less and less stable, and disagregated, and so on. (39)</p>
<p>But still no indication of where these intellectual trends came from or not yet anyway.</p>
<p>* VV Nancy Fraser's themes what is releavant here??</p>
<p>* Upon reading ""Rediscovery of the Market"" chapter: Key question here I think is is this simply a ""rediscovery"" of the market -- ie of the notion of the market that existed in the nineteenth century and in the works of classical political economists? Rodgers suggests not and that in fact even the marginalists, like Alfred Marshall, had works that assumed the existence of city markets, not the globalized, abstract, and electronic forms of exchange that were in place by the 1970s, see 44-45. I wish he had developed this point a bit more explicitly. What was the new vision? In the section on the ""rational expectation"" ecnomissts he comes closest when he desscribes their imagined subject as a clever ""long-term calculators,"" who acted cleverly in time in relation to fluctuating money values, see bottom 65-66: ""The economics actors at their models' center were skilled inflation managers: not the produces of the classical economists', not even Marshall's cotton dalesr minding the telegraph at Manchester [this is a reference to marginalist Alfred Marshall], but lightening calculators and instant discounters of time, able to work out a life-earnings function on the way to the savings bank, to project with ease the comparative returns of the new global investment instruments coming ever more rabildy on line, or to see through the illusion of a tax cut that someone, sometime, would have to pay back. Rational expectations was economics for an inflationary decade, when the time-dependency of value was a lesson of day-to-day experience."" (6</p>
<p>Aso useful is the pages 74-75 where he describes the new global faith in the wisdom and efficiency of markets and then say that it was not only that, but that markets were see as a source of ""boundless freedom"" and in fact that they ""accomplished what theorists had imagined democracy to do."" They expressed people's intentions and desires, acted as referenda taking machines. He cites Citibank's Walter Wrison in 1992 saying that markets are ""voting machines."" And then Friedman who said that markets had ""turned the whole world into a parliamentary system."" Rodgers then writes: ""Unlike deliberative politics, markets were the realm of freedom. Loosed from instiutitons and power, they silently did their work: optimizing, signaling, making tangible the domain of choice."" (75)</p>
<p>This last quote got me thinking about my thing on culture: the argument that cultural discourse ultimately unveiled a new domain of private or personal politics that was primary to public politics and also constituted it..</p>
<p>A GENERAL OBSERVATION re the argument about fraxture: it seems at times that Rodgers is talking about a social language that is describing a fragmented or fractured society; but it also seems at times that he's talking about a ""language"" that iself has fragmented, or that is circulating in ways that makes it fragmented or prone to a kind of recombination etc that treats the language as he calls it like a ""contagion of metaphors."" When he describes the ""novel forms of intellectual production and circulation"" at the start (but without talking about its structural bases) on p.2 is one instance in which he gets at the idea that the language is&nbsp; eing ussed in a way that fragments it. Another instance in the thick of his description (and there are others) is when he is describign the discusison of vouchers in the ""Little Platoons"" chapter and he says that the ""terms combined and recombined in strange configurations.""&nbsp; (218) What he's described is the way a set of ideas developed within one domain of poltics is taken up in another domain for different reasons. He describes this scenario in virtually every chapter. But then is this what he means when he says, fo rexample at the start of the ""Wrinkle in Time"" chapter that ""As very very language for society threatened to break into fragments..."" ???</p>

The Intellectual History of Anthropological Thought in the Age of Enlightenment,"<p>00 Summary 00</p>
<p>The largest point of this introduction to this book of essays on anthropology and enligthenment is, not suprisingly, that cultural relativism was central to enlightened thought.  The author starts with Montesquieu's <em>Persian Letters</em> and Jonathan Swift's <em>Gulliver's Travels</em>, moves to Voltaire and Rousseau, Alberto Fortis, Cook, and then also Herder and Sade.</p>
<p>Gulliver's Travels described an experience of travel that created a ""cultural"" comparison: ""The relative comparison of cultures had destabilized Gulliver's relaiton to his own, leaving him in a condition of anthropological ambivalence."" (7)  Wolff argues that that experience of travel become well known by he mid 18th century even if it was not at the time Gulliver's Travels was publoished i the 1720s.</p>
<p>So Wolff argues that in contrast to the Renaissance which has long been associated with ""[t]he representation of objects in relative and proportional size, dpending upon their perceived three-dimensioal depth in a two-dimensional painting or drawin...[and] a revolution in reflections on human perception in relation to physical space.  The Enlightenment may be correspondingly characterized by the discovery of cultural perspective, with its revolutionary destabilization of the eighteenth-century observe who found herself returning not to Old England, bur rather to a new kind of anthropolgical space, globally demarcated by the principle of cultural relativity, imbuded with the unfamiliar flavors of Greek wines, African fruits, and Houyhnhnm virtues.""

"Creating a Female Dominion in American Reform, 1890-1935","0 p.xiv-xv Relationship to Lit on Welfare State

""I see one source of New Deal policies -- the ofundation of hte US welfare state -- in the peculiar predicament of turn-of-the-century women searching for professional niches."". (xv).   I'm not sure whatshe means here exactly, but she ends up noting that women noted that men would cede control ""to ackonlwedge the female right to expertise in instances where women or children were the only clients.""  (xv)  Thus these women defined social problems in terms that made women and children central.  Which in turn led them to ""blame their nonprofessional sisters for all children's ills"" and this led in turn to a shortening of the ""leash that tied most women to home and children.""  Thus ""Insistence on the primacy of the mother-child relationship in child development, the obligation of mothers to stay at home, and fathers to earn a family's living were critical tenets in shaping welfare policies oppressive to women.  Andthere is no denying the central role that female policymakers played in perpetuating those tenets and drafting those policies."" (xv) 

I.e. it is partly the conditions of female professionals -- their strategic needs -- that shaped the policy... interesting argument!! 

Her last paragraph says she doesn't want to critique these women, but rather theworld that made it necesssary to take these strategies in finding a place as professoinals..."
Liberalism Repatriated: Prospects of an Anthropology of Antiracism,"p.332 Humanity and Multicultural Naitonal Project

Humanity he defines as an ""idea defined through shared value concepts...[that] includes all those who believe in well established goods such as 'freedom' and sovereignty'"" (332)  

Multinational nation project: U.S. invovled attempt to embed notions of humanity in institutions combined with an ""effort to reconcile institutionalized values with real deviations, heterogeneity, hybridity, and polyglossia, presented by the variety of cultural idioms brought by immigrants from Eastern and Southern Europe, and to a lesser degree Latin American and Asai."" (332) Sums this up saying that the US ""had to combine mechanisms to institutionalize values at the highest level (albeit nominally bracketing religioisity) in tandemn with mechanisms to incorporate challenges to those values through rational judgement."" (332)  

These two activities he says form the ""two sides fo the multicultural naitonal project."" (332)   

He uses Elisabeth Povinelli's ""The Cunning of Recognition"" to futher elaborate.  The two sides she has named ""moral sensibility"" and ""critical rational knowledge"" and they have a complicated relationship.  Moral sensibility is something ""that refers always to something beyond discosures...[that]makes an appeal to some tacit, 'pre-theoretical' way of thinking."" (332) Critical rational knowledge is ""that kind"" of knowledge that ""is able to reflect on itself."" (332)  But critical rational knowledge has a postive relationship to moral sensibility: ""The goal of critical rational knowledge is to not simply to allow routinized procedures to deliver a just conclusion; it is also to reinforce the value concepts that underly its assumptions.  So although value judgements are made separate from that which is considered ratoinal knowledge [ due to professionalizaiton??], the separation between the two fields is not a logical impasse but the result of great labor to evacuate the appareance of morality from the realm of rationality.  Moral sensiblity, therefore, brackets questions of rationality in the very act of being the very foundation on which its mechanisms are based.  Without the distinction, however, a moral sensiblity could not be treated as universal [page break] and rational judgement could not appear to relativize to consider specific practical dilemmas.""

That sphere also existed among kids she notes and writes: ""Middle-class women's sphere of activity and friendship extended to girls, who were allowed to have close, even passionate, relationships with other girls. Such friendships were viewed as an innocent outgrowth of the emotionality of adolescence and as a way of preparing girls for the emotinal bonding of the adult female community and of marriage. Moreover, they deterred seduction by males and possible pregnancy at a time when the age of first marriage was rising...Girls were expcted to have a 'best' friend or a 'bosom' firend;such relationships were often called 'smashes' or 'crushes.'

(25) Mead's grandmother, Emily Fogg , daughter of James Fogg, Chicago seed merchant. She wnet to Wellesley for two years then Fogg's seed business went bankrupt and she had ot work to fund the rest of her education at U. chicago, graduating in 1896. She then worked as a teacher in girls' school near New York City. (25) Mead's mother Emily fogg Mead, was active as a volunteer in many reform organization's including the Amer.

(45) So then Banner wonders whether Benedict's"" mask"" was about being a stranger in a strange land? Or whether it ""may have been related to a sense of sexual difference on her part.""

<li id=""i2220"">p.140-141 The War's effect on Benedict Banner thinks Benedict was deeply affected by the war and that she more or less explicitly connected it with the masculine type. Banner reads this out of Benedict's story the ""Bo-Cu Plant"". In the story there are a bunch of men smokin cigars and one tell sthe theory of the Bo Cu plant., a bunch of surveyers sent to see this region and one falls in love with local owman, Nita whosse mother palced a curse on her that she would never find sxual fulmillment in marraige. Husband kills Nita with an ax when bride turns into devel on weeding day. Banner says the story included image of ""female Amazons"" turning on men, image of Key and others. And it has many male characters who manipulate women and the environment. Banner's interpretation is that these men represent the male imperisalists that many thought had brought on WWI. (141) Banner sees this story as rejecting conventional masculinity even more strongly (141) Benedict wrote in her journal in May 1917: ""How useless to attempt anything but a steady day-by-day living with this tornado of world-horror over our heads."" (quoted on 141) Banner notes that Benedict saw like many others that the war destroyedthe optimism of the 19th century. So the ideals of neo-Romantics like Key were no longer possible to think about. She remembered in college a teacher sayin that Hobbe's Leviathan was outdated b/c no Leviathan's in sight. But htis was not longer true during the war (141). And Banner notes that in Benedict's books images of Leviathan and Behemoth, the beats of the Battle of Armageddon appear in her poetry, and in her Bo-Cu plant story the ""devel became the deux ex machina"" (141) Banner refers also to brutla imagery in her poem ""Resurgam"" and another poem about the young poet Rubert Brooke who was called in the war and who became a ""transatlantic symbol of youth wasted"" Banner says (141) In this context, Feminism focused onhumanism. Beatric Forbes-Robertson Hale wrote in a survey of feminism: ""We are being wrecked by an over-masculinized race...Feminism only comes of age when it develops into humanism."" (quoted on 142, from What Women Want) Banner also cites several other sources here: Lorine Livingston Pruette, ""The Evolution of Disenchantment"" in These Modern Women: Autobiographyical Essay sfrom the TWenties, ed. Elaine Showalter 1978; Linda Schott, Women Against War: Pacifism, Feminism, and Social Justice in the United States, 1915-1941 (Phd. Diss, 1985).; William L. O'Neill, Everyone was Brave: The Rise and Faall of Feminism in America, (1969); Ellen Carol Dubois, Harriot Stanton Blatch and the Winning of Women Suffrage (1997). In this context Mead called for a women's movement focsued on ""personality,"" Banner writes:. ""...on attaining the creative individuality that Key--and Nietzsche--had called for. 'The ultimate objective, the high goal, remains an inward affair, a matter of attitude,' Benedict wrote. What women needed was not a 'semi-political party' but--using a religious metaphor--a 'new birth' to a new self. 'We can harldy drag back form oblivion,' she conlude, 'the vital questions that were life and death to us in the early summer of 1914'--questions that concerned suffrage and women's rights."" (142-143) Banner's quote here is compiled from material in draft intro to ""Adventures in Womanhood"" and a diary entry in 146 in Anthrop. at Work.

<li id=""i1552"">p.143 - Adventures in Womanhood. Benedict conceived the project ""Adventures in Womanhood"" in order to explore the problem of female personality, which she saw as the proper question for feminism during the war. So she though of writing bios of Marry Wollstonecraft, Margaret Fuller, Olve Schreiner and putting them in one voulme. Banner writes: ""Wollstonecraft represented the rational egalitarianism of the Enlightenement, Ruller the organic and gender-crossing strains of Romanticism, and Olive Schreiner the early twentieth century's neo-Romanticism and feminism. All of them called for independent, gender-balanced individuals; Wolstonecraft and Fuller both had romantic friendships with women when young and then married when older and had children. All three supported humanitarian reform and the advancement of women, although none was a militant rights advocate..."" (143) Banner goes through Benedict's essay on Wollstonecraft, nothing specially revealing in her analysis, but the evident discusion of ideal female personality. Relatoins with women, with men, how independent, how passionate etc. ??? Fuller was revealing on these issues Banner notes and had written in Women in the Nineteenth Century (her major work of 1845) that ""male and female are perpetually passing into one another..."" (145) and ""there is no wholly masculine man or purely feminine woman."" (146) But Fuller also wrote: ""Were they free, were they wise fully to deveop the strength and beauty of woman, they would never wish to be man, or man-like."" (quoted o 146). The project was ulimtately rejected by Houghton Mifflin and then she gave it up. App. Benedict herself was not suprirsed since she had dected a ""falsetto note"" in the bwriteing. And Banner writes: ""Indeed, 'Mary Wollstonecraft' has a melodramatic quality that read likes a holdover from 'The Bo-Cu Plant.'"" (146)

And that after the war it was primarily women that helped keep the business of the dept. going. ""By the outbreak of World War I, however, the constituency of graduate studentsin anthropology at Columbia had shifted. Male enrollment dropped off, as young men enlisted in the army, while the war undermined the unity in the German-Jewish community, which split along pro-German and pro-Allied lines. The Columbia admnistration offended liberal Jews by introducing discriminatory tests as requirement for admission to the college, while Boas's dispute with Nicholas Murray Butler over the war resulted in a reduction of the anthropology department's funds and faculty lines. By 1919 only two graduate students were in residence, and one was Gladys Reichard. Boas and Elsie Clews Parsons decided that women could replace the missing men. Boas's male students could be difficult, often exhibiting, in Mead's words, 'stiff-necked opposition' and 'disgruntled yielding.'"" (197)

<li id=""i1407"">p.207 - 209 Female Modernists of Greenwich Village and Benedict American Female modernists in U.S. Poetry Journals flourished after the war. Harriet Monroe had established the magainze Poetry in Chicago in 1912. Women in this circle: Amy Lowell, Gertrude Stein, H.D., Marianne Moore, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Louise Bogan (Mead's friend). These women palyed with masculine persona's and some of them almost completelytook on male personas in their poetry such as Stein, Lowell, and Bogan. Banner writes that these women used a tradition of lyrical poetry but with a strong intelelctualism: ""They defied male modernists like Eliot and Pound, who were often antiwoman in their verse, by writing poetry in women's traditional lyric style, yet with an intellectualism and emotionalism unmatched by men."" (207) And they were popular. Millya, for instance, became the public model of the flapper. The goal Banner says was to distance themsevles from the ""nightingale"" tradition of sentimental women poets. Those which Banner suggests T.S. Eliot refered to in the opening of ""The Lovesong of J. Alfred Prufrock"" ""In the room the women come and go /Talking of Michelangelo..."" (208) These women also drew upon the symbolidsts like Yeats andPount but also metaphysical poets like Donne ""who wrote about reason and emotion, love and death, suffering and salvation in the same breath..."" (208) Banner suggests that they outdid even Eliot in playing with these themes. She writes: ""For they identified with emotionalism--that was decidedly female territory--but they tried to control it. 'They absorbed the male modernists and then used them to elaborate female themes of love and madness.' They were 'anti-modern modernists.'"" (208) That classification of them as anti-modern modernists comes from Susan McCabe in ""'A Queer Lot' and the Lesbian Talent: Amy Lowell, Gertrude Stein, and H.D."" in Challenging Boundaries, ed. Warren (2000) Other sources she cites here on modernist women. Marilyn Farwell, ""Toward a Definition of the Lsbian Literary Imagination,"" Signs 14: 100-118; Gloria Bowels, Louis Bogan's Aesthetic of Limitation (1987); Susan Friedman, Peneloope's Web: Gender, Modernity, H.d.'s Fiction (1990); Gillian Hanscombe and Vigin smyers, Writing for Their Lives: The Modernist Women, 1910-1940 (1987).

She also shifted bewteen male and female voices Banner says (208). In her poetry, men Banner says are ""often trapped: Theseus is trapped in the labyrinth; Orion is confined to the heavens; Christ suffers and is crucified . Sometimes a female exists who can release them, as Ariadne rescures Theseus."" (208)

She said they had produced a 'new tyranny.'

She mentions Horace Kallen saying he was a ""favforite social philosopher of theirs.

""Jung roamed over history, concluding that the East, with its mystical religions, was introverted, while the West, expansive and imperalist, was extraverted."" (228) Jung Banner writes had also raised gender question. He ""maintained that males possessed a female 'anima' and females a male 'animus'--in what seems a variation on contemporary notions of inversion. Most present-day feminists take Jung as a misogynist,on the grounds that he usually rated the animus superior to the anima, but he had feminist followers in New York."" Beatrice Hinkle was one.

He was more interested. Ultiamtely he decided htat she had a ""prostitution complex"" ""that resulted from her girlhood conviction that she was unattractive and that drove her to have promiscuous intercourse with men to prove her desirability."" (231) Then Sapir decided to appeal to Mead's masochism. He ""announced that he intended to reshape her, to 'hew right and left, as a sculptor flakes oof his marble bits with courage and coolness'...""

He accused her as ""something cruel, Ruth, in your love for psychic irregularities."" (quoted on 232, from ES to RFB , oct 13, 1925) The whoel thing ended with Ruuth and Mead's trip to Grand Canyon, which Banner connects to Bendict's fantasy world and the ravine in Mead's chilldhood. (233) And it led to the letter to Mead's grandmother about their different reactions, which Banner reads in terms of sexual symbolism Mead's being masculine admiring ""miles of pinnacled clay,' with a 'new shadowing cloud' showing endless possibilities.'"" (233) Whereas Benedict seeks secrecy in the river, a female symbol. (233) Mead kept writing to Sapir after that but Sapir gave her an ultimatum after he met another woman and then when she didn't respond he married th other woman. Mead then burned his letters (234).

Mead made a stand: she asserted, following Jung, that the way to connect a culture and human behavior and thus to establish an intellectual direction for the field of anthropology was to find a theory that established a systematic relationship between universal characteristics of humans and their representations in specific cultures. Benedict disagreed. She though that no theory was necessarily any better than any other and that cultures had little coherence. That was her psotion in the fall of 1926, a position that reflected both the stance she had taken in her dissertation and her gloomin Europe over Mead's behavior. Yet a year later she changed her mind, insprired by a new impetus from her fieldwork among the Puetblo Indians and a new turn in her relationshp with Mead.""

In it she talks about a dream acquring a passport to Reo's heterosexual world. And she wrote ""The whole business...is an expression of a suppressed fear that after all I am primarily a homosexual person."" And then Banner says that she had corssed out homosexual and wrote in heterosexual. (266) She also wrote that her dreams about a dead baby ""is a heterosexual attitude neglected and starved, and finally dead and rotting, but hidden away from everyone."" (quoted on 266) Banner writes on 268 that Mead had a fear of exposure ofbeing homosexual. esp. in the context of the turn against homosexuality in the late 20s. The Wanda Neff novel may have heightened that fear. (268-9) Ruth answered it too. See Dream Research File in Mead, Library ofCongress On Homosexuality also see her review of Flloyd Dell's Love in the Machine Age in which he charged tat increase in homosexuals would destroy Western civilization. Apparently Banner writes Mead only ""mildly protested"" Dell's claims. (269) But Mead was reading book with homosexual themes. Banner lists robert Herrick's, The End of Desire; David Garnett's Go she Must (1927); Rosamond Lehmann's Dusty Answer (1927); Virginia Woolf's Orlando (1928); Marcle Prousit's Cities of the Plain (1927). ( 269) In 1935 Mead also again referred to fear of having her sexual identity exposed in a <em>Forum</em> article. It had to do with perceptions of people with non-membership in their sex: ""By 1935, in an article she wrote for the journal <em>Forum</em>, a public interest magazine, she alludd to that fear--and she linked it to the issue of sexual identity. 'A Person without full sex membership' she wrote, 'is worse off than a man without a country.' In many professional fields, Mead implied, successful women faced being identitified as mannish and thus homosexual. That possiblity was a 'handicap' that generated a 'paralyzing fear.' 'Every woman who enters a field where in proportion as she is successful she will be voted unwomanly,' Mead concluded,' works under a handicap, a handicap of paralyzing fear.'"" (271)

And Benedict says Banner reports in Intertwined lIves, p.498, f.n. 101, that it was also published “in a book on marriage that was edited by an assisant minsiter at her brother-in-law's church and issued by a religious press., see RFB to MM June 10, 1931 LC, S-5. Banner argues that this text is “damning Mead and the book—without mentioning her or it by name.” (280, Intertwined Lives). In it Banner says that he “called her a 'bored adventurer' 'a hetaera,' and a 'prostitute' so jaded that she was sexuall frigid. He attacked her for failing to realize the importance of jealousy in a committed relationship, for a 'true lover' in his view couldn't stand any hint of infidelity. He accused her of having misinterpreted her data, charging that her belief in the 'enrichment of personality' through 'multiple experience' prevented her from viewing 'organisational responses skeptically.' He asserted that all 'primitive' societies had rigid taboos on sex and that none permitted sexual license. “ (280-281) Banner also argues that Sapir seems to have tried to publish this text in as many places as possible. He wanted people to see it. (280) Banner, though, argues that Sapir's ""vendetta against Mead"" existed before Coming of Age and continued long after. That he was criticziing her in 1925 when she was in Samoa and he was with Malinowski on a tour of anthropology depts. in the U.S. (281) In 1929, he writes to Benedict that ""Mead was a 'loathesome bitch,' a 'malodorous symbol' of everything that he hated in American culture.""

And that she thought he was trying to do them in. (281, MM to RFB, Dec.2, 1932). But in 1930 Banner reports in f.n. #498, p281: ""Mead had Leonie Adams write to Edmund Wilson at the New Republic, asking him not to send her book on the Manus to Sapir to review, since 'he has a bad case of prejudice in that quarter.' (Leonie Adams to Wilson, Oct. 5, 1930, Edmund Wilson Papers.)"" In 1937 Banner says that Mead complained ""to Benedict that she wasn't being consulted in the profession becaues of the old canard spread by Sapir and Malinowski.""

'It would be absurd,' she wrote, 'to cut every culture down ot the Procrustean bed of some catchword characterization.' Her 'modernism' wasn't simple: it always encompassed on some level the emphasis on variety of her doctoral dissertation, the breaking down of absolutes. Moreover, she argued that Western categories for mental disturbances, like schizophrenia and manic-depressive disorder, probably didn't hold for non-Western socities: she terby challenged their validity even for the United States. She implied a similar possiblity with regard to gender, point thie way to Mead's revisions in this area.""

Banner gives no page # in Growing up, but p. 150 in Changing Culture. Banner sums it up this way: ""The Manus women are pawns in a system of exchanges accompanying marriage; the Omaha women are so enmeshed in their traditional culture that they don't take advantage of their legal rights under the laws of the United States. IN both societies group rape is glorified by men. In her article on jealousy (1931), Mead asserted that 'throughout history women have been the &lt;i&gt;insecure&lt;/i&gt; sex. Their status, the freedom of action, their very economic existence, their right over their own children, has been dependent upon their preservation of their personal relations with men.'

He critiqued her of avoiding the individual in ""The Emergence of the Concept of Personality in a STudy of Cultures"" Journal of Social Psych 5 (1933): 408-15. He accused her moroever Banner says of ""focusing on the concept of culture rather than the individual as a way of hiding her own self, and of failing to realize that cultures were mainly collections of individual who interpreted cultural patterns in 'endlessly differetn ways.'""

Perhaps Zuni, but she didn't like their self-control and conformity. She might then have preferreed the Plains Indians who had this individualistic vision quest. But she didn't like their warlike tendencies. And Banner note sthat her most positive description of any group is of thePlains Indians, the men-women of the Plains Indians. Shje was drawaing on Elsie Clews Parsons work! about berdaches. They were ridiculted among the Zuni, but not so much among the Plains indians. ""where there role was more fully developed than in any other Native American culture area."" (304) But they were there regarded as superior b/c they could excell in both men's and women's occupations. She wrote that the berdache's house was ""a model for all households through the sole efforts of the berdache.' For the man-woman had 'two strings to his bow,' wrote Benedict, and 'no one in the culture was richer.'"" (304) Banner adds that this celebratio nof the berdache can also be seen as a critique of Kroebe'rs ""celebration of the masucline of the Plains Indians in his lectres at Columbia in 1932."" Banner speculates: ""The institution of th berdache made the male anthropologists uncomfortable, and they avoided it, often assuming that effete males took on the role to avoid becoming warriors and that they were ridiculed for doing so."" (304) Though she notes that Kroeber argued that antihomosexual attitudes were not good in ""Psychosis or Social Sanction"" in Characterand personality 3 (1940): 210. And Lowie Banner notes was ambivalent, and she cites Primitive Religion (orig. pub. 1924, 1973) pp. 1818, 243-46. He called it perversion apparently but praised connection to spirituality in some tribes. (see f.n. 74, p502.)

<li id=""i1807"">p.304-306 Shift in Benedict's attitude by writing Patterns Banner argues that once Benedict wrote Patterns she had excised her deeper angst. And that the book also had a more pragmatic reformist side. Banner writes ""By this point she had largely solved the issues of religion and reason and of emotion and self-realization that had long troubled her. She could write about the horrors of the religion of the Kwakiutl because she had resolved them for herself. In a series of entries she wrote for the <em>Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences</em> on religion, magic, and myth, Benedict took a stand in favor of a rational skepticism and a social-psychological point of view. Thus she maintained that myth and folklore were no more than wish fulfillment, and magic was mechanistic. It involved a philosophy, not a mysterious connection between animate objects and a spirit world. Even the Zuni snake dance, with priests handling the dread rattlesnake, winding it around their bodies and putting its head into their mouths, wasn't dangerous, since they removed the poison from the snake's poison sac before they danced with it. Benedict now viewed magic as dangerous in a new way, for it could lead to 'fear neuroses' such as those that troubled Freud's 'obsessional neurotics.'"" (306) {para} When Beneidct completed these articles, not much was left of her earlier espousal of Pater an Yeats and the search for secular ecstasy thorugh symbols that might lead to a sense of unity with an all-encompassing universe. 'Scientific advance,' she wrote, 'is always furthered by giving up patheism.' God was not more than the trickster figure of American Indian religions--or he was a 'doddering old woman.' These articles...sugested that reason had come to predominate in Bendedict's life. She had become the rational male that becoming homosexual implied to her."" (305-6)</li>

<li id=""i1299"">p.314 Mead's Fascination w/ Berdache in Omaha summer of 1930 Banner writes: ""During that summer Margaret became fascinated by a young Omaha man who was becoming a berdache. His behavior was so ambiguous that she couldn't tell if he was male or female. Tribal members were calling him 'her'; he was turning from doing men's work to doing women's work. In tribal dances, dressed as a man, he began dancing among the men, and then, putting on jewelry, he danced among the women. Reo's homosexual friend Max Bickerton came to visit from Japan, and he thought that the young man's walk was exactly like that of male prostitutes in Japan. Margaret thought that he didn't walk the way women walked; his movements in walking seemed to come from some fantasy of his about how women moved. The tribe's prostitute refused to have sex with him; tribal members made fun of him. When he was a young boy, she was told, several women had examined his genitalia."" (314) Banner says that this made a big impression on Mead. She had seen male ""perverts"" and female ""mixed types"" . She had seen casual homosexual behav. in Manus apparently. But she had never seen someon in the act of becoming. So Banner htinks she wondered was he a ""congenital invert' womeone with an innate drive twoard homosexuality?"" Was he a transvestite, heterosexual cross dresser? Was he a hermaphrodite? Banner thinks this challenged her differences with Benedict. Her dubiousness about Benedit's cultural determinism, especially when it came to gender, because Banner thinks that Mead was ""so certain that culture was paramount when it came to gender: she felt intuivitely that heredity was important, as in the differences between herself and her siblings.""

<p class=""plaintext"">p.315-316 Mead's Attitude about Culture &amp; Gender Before going to Sepik Mead was perhaps not clear on gender when she went to New Guinea (Sepik) the second time with Reo. She knew that she wanted to study roles of men and women. There is evidence that at this point she felt that societies operated in binary: ""She thought she had to study cultures that separate masculine from feminine, although at this point she thought that most societies operated in terms of that binar, as she stated in &lt;i&gt;Sex and Temperament&lt;/i&gt;: 'I shared the general belief of our society that there was a natural sex-temperament which could at the most only be distorted or diverted from normal expression.' She had considered even mixed types, she wrote, to be composed of men with feminine temperaments and women with masculine ones. [see Sex &amp; Temp. p. xiv]"" (315) Banner further describes that she thought she needed to take herdity into account, but neither she nor Reo knew biology. Then Banner says she decided that it was wise to address how cultural differences were determined culturally before biologically which Banner says is what William Fielding Ogburn ""had stressed in his class at Barnard..."" (316) Here Banner has no citation for this claim about Ogburn. Banner also argues the Mead's sexual binarism was ""overdrawn"" considering that Beatrice Hinkle did work breaking down this binary, and the ""existence of the bisexual chic of the 1920s."" (316) But the ""mannish lesbian"" (i.e. the kind of figure that Mead was thinking of with her woman with masculine traits) was also a strong figure at the time. She notes Radclyffe Hall's &lt;i&gt;Well of Loneliness&lt;/i&gt;; Freud's assertion in the ""Psychogenesis of a Case of Homosexuality in a Woman"" that ""...'bodily and mental traits belonging to the opposite sex are apt to coincide.'"" (quoted on 316) as contributing to the image. (316) Anthropological work on the subject had been done by Edward Westermarck &lt;i&gt;Origin and Development of the Moral Ideas&lt;/i&gt;. There he had said that sexuality ranged between inversion and normal sexuality, but that homosexual were ""inverts."" (316) William McDougal a Harvard scienceists had said that he didn't know the connection bewteen homosexuality and inversion, but that homosexuality did exist. And in the popular &lt;i&gt;The Dominant Sex&lt;/i&gt; a feminist work of 1920s, Mathilde Vaerting argued that in societies where women controlled men, they became masculine in behavior. In Patterns, Benedict used homosexuality and invert interchangeably, see p.262 of patterns.</p>

I believe every person of ordinary sex endowmen has a capacity of diffuse 'homosexual' sex expression and specific climax--according to the temperamental situation. To call men who prefer the diffuse experience 'feminine' or women who feel only the specific 'masculine' or both 'mixed types' is a lot of obfuscation--or nonsense. ."" Mead also wrote ""You're a perfectly good woman...who prefers different temperamental types and responds differently to them."" (334) (333-334, MM to RFB, March 29, 1933, Lib. Cong, R-7).

I am reading this for my ""Manifold Origins"" paper. Dorothy I suggested that I look at it in regards to the historiographical point that I am trying to make re modernism and postmodernism. She thought that in the historiography the whole discussion about modernism v &nbsp;postmodernism and what they are is less and less important, but that the issues of universalism v particularism continue to be argued. I wonder what it means that there is a move away from arguing the modernism/postmodernism thing. Certainly, it is tiresome! Especially, the way it seems to be breaking here in Berliin, and in my conversations with Anselm. The whole turn against postmodernism as a negative thing...which misrepresents the goals of postmodernism and describes it as a return of the ""barbaric."" This being part of a celebration of Enlightenment and of what Hollinger hear calls ""cognitivism."" I just wonder if the desire to move away from postmodernism is just a way of turning back toward cognitivism in the end; because those who see postmodern ideas as useful **need** to answer their critics in the post-9/11 world. Hollinger in his ""The Knower and the Artificer"" essay is I think somewhat dismissive of the critique of cognitivism that was made at the end of the 19th Century by Nietzsche and the like. I think that by separating the Knower and the Artificer as two types he wants to isolate the two lines of thought in a way that forces a choice and leads anyone with a scientific impulse to turn toward cognitivism. I am not 100% sure that is what he is doing but it is my basic understanding and I do not like it. Dorothy, however, suggested I look at the postscript here with the following statement:</span><br style=""color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;"" /><br style=""color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;"" /><span style=""color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;"">&gt;&gt;Re the historiographical issue, modernist and postmodern insights can be seen as intertwined at their late 19th century origin. Dorothy wrote to me: ""Postmoderns have often accused modernists of lack of courage in seeing them through - Defenders of the enlightenment would see that as a wise resistance to irrationality. Boas seems to have a foot in both camps. I think you can pick up some of this in Hollinger's Postscript to his essay in my Modernist Impulses volume.</span>""<br style=""color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;"" /><br style=""color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;"" /><span style=""color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;"">&gt; I am like these postmoderns in accusing the defenders of the englightenment of a lack of courage in seeing through what Dorothy describes as the late 19th century intertwining of modernist and postmodernist insights. But what is this intertwining? I was making an argument like this in the Manifold Origins article. The ""modernist impulse"" as well as the postmodernist impulse, I argue, &nbsp;are linked to the recognition of the problem of subjectivity at the end of the 19th century -- a development that had many causes and which produced many reactions. Modernism and postmodernism are names for one branching of those responses: the modernist, I think, still confronts the problem of subjectivity but tries, if she is a scientist, to use it as a basis to reconstruct a new scientific approach that recognizes the problem. Dewey and Peirce and Weber are examples it seems. Then there is the postmodernist reaction, which is grounded in aestheticism, in a tendency to collapse the scientific-cognitivist project of the Enlightenment into something else, not concerned with accurate representation of the extenral world and so on. What I have found in Boas is somebody containing both of these impulses, linked together, each having more or less clear advantages and disadvantages. &nbsp;Pehaps Hollinger's postscript will help me clarify the terms again...but also Dorothy's argument was that I should downplay the discussion of modernism and postmodernism and focus instead on my sense that what is important is ""how we think today in a globalizing world about cosmopolitanism..."" and the positions of univerality v hybridity...</span><br style=""color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;"" /><br style=""color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;"" /><span style=""color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;"">&gt; Starting notes with the Postscript...I should re-read the actual essay, but for the moment here is the basic sense of his argument that I will be working with. I must have notes somewhere. But the idea is, I think, that he distrusts the word modernism, which he thinks is unclear and has acquired a kind of culture mystique in the academy at the time of his writing, which was in the 70s. And in particular he has noted that what is not clear is whether those people who still want to make something of science can be considered part of ""modernism,"" or whether it is just a kind of Nietzschean aestheticization of science that counts as modernism. He thinks modernism includes both scientists and artists who do want to continued making something of science. So he wants to included what he calls ""cognitivism"" -- as distinct from artifice -- in modernism. I do not have a problem with this claim...it seems true...he gives some examples, saying even that Nietzsche was interested in the knower, at the same time as he gave the artificer langauge to critique the nower with. He is thinking, he says in f.n. 24, of Nietzsche's discussions of a ""will to truth."" And he refers their to some articles on Nietzsche's notion of truth. I wonder what he would make of Megill's treatment of N's theory of truth? In any case, Hollinger also points out James as someone engaging in an *""effort to bring the Artificer to bear on a theory of science.""* (36) This all makes sense to me. &nbsp;But to call it cognitivism, then, is to too strongly identify the cognitive aim as dominant and the aesthetic one as subordinate. It rips asunder a project that may have &nbsp;been more ambivalently testing out the different possibilities of nineteenth and early twentieth-century modernity.

""The Knower is maligned more than ever as we move into our *fin de siecle*, yet the values this figure embodies are simultaneously invoked with renewed insistence by critics of postmodernism."" (46) His point in the postscript is that he thinks there is a pattern of ""constructions of *modernism* current within the postmodernist debate render all the more appropriate an effort by historians to confront what I call cognitivism.""

(46) Hollinger sees something of a consensus here in the literature:</span><br style=""color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;"" /><span style=""color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;"">&gt;...the modernism invoked as a contrast to postmodernism by postmodernism's advocates, critics, and commentators turns out again and again, to be rooted less in the artistic and literary avant gardes of 1890-1930 and more in the scientific enthusiasms of Descartes, Kant, and the multitude of rationalists, realists, positivists, objectivists, and social engineers of the nineteenth century. Historians accustomed to thinking of modernism as a revolt against positivism may be instructed by references to the 'positivist-modernist tradition,' a historical presence invoked confidently, for example, in the introduction to a breathlessly up-to-date-book entitled *Life after Postmodernism*. (46) He gives some more details of the langauge he is talking about, including a notion that modernism was about the Cartesian ""I"" for example.

He writes: "" How did modernism get here? Well, 'here' -- the Enlightenment -- is where it has always been, for some people."" (47) Ie he is suggesting that the pattern has recognized what he had sensed in the original article. He writes more and a bit ambiguously: ""The postmodernist debates have accelerated a process by which two quite distinctive revolts against two disparate modernisms have become coexistent, and to some extent integrated, within a single discourse."" (47) The two revolts he means are:</span><br style=""color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;"" /><br style=""color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;"" /><span style=""color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;"">&nbsp;1) the revolt against high modernism in literature and the arts--typical in the work of John Cage, Thomas Pynchon, and John Barth, celebarted by Susan Sontag, Leslie Fiedler, and Ihab Hassan, who stressed this revolt's ""dynamism and authenticity in contrast to canonical modnerism said to have long lost its capacity to function as an avant garde."" (47) Hollinger also points to a class 1973 paper: ""The Myth of Postmodernist Breakthrough"" by Gerald Graff, that laid out this revolt against modernism. Hollinger writes: ""Descartes, Kant, and Miller were far from central to salient modernism, although complaints did attribute to the American cultural scence a caution, a prudence, and a formal rationality that could be seen as the legacies of a desiccated Enlightenment insufficiently renounced.""

(48) This revolt involved the poststructuralist critiques of Foucautl, Derrida, Lyotard and Baudrillard, who ""responded not to literary and artistic cannon but to ideas about language and the human subject inscribed in the prevailing discourses of philospohy, psychology, and politics, especially in France."" (48) They drew on the earlier critiqes of Nietzsche and Heidegger, who HOllinger notes were known by that time in the Anglophone world as modernists ""loosely comparable to the artist-heroes of the modern cannon."" (48) These writers were not primarily known as postmodernists until after Lyotard's 1984 *Postmodern Condition*.</span><br style=""color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;"" /><br style=""color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;"" /><span style=""color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;"">* What Hollinger wants to say is that these two revolts were ""amalgamated."" (48, he uses this word). These two distinct reactions against distinct modernisms, Hollinger thinks, would not necessarily have been lumped together in the US ""had not so many American intellectuals been held in thrall by the quaint belief that there is but a single torch to be passed, requiring that each cultural moment, however multitudinous, be named as though it were an individual or an organization charged with institutionalized responsibility."" (48) This amalgamation was further helped by Rorty's engagement with the French movement. Same also with Jameson, whose 1984 ""Postmodernism, or the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism"" was key. And many American followers of the Frankfurt School were engaged with postmodernism by Habermas's ""attacks on the French postmodernists and on Hans-Georg Gadamer for betraying the Enlightenment project"" (49) Then by the late 1980s there were ""a host of all-encompassing assessments of postmodernism, touchign upon film, architecture, poetry, epistemology, social theory, fiction, and political economy."" (49) The best of these being Harvey's *Condition of Postmodernity*.

He suggests that there is in these works a kind of ""protohistoriography"" of the 1890-1930 period that imagines the tension between knowing and artifice was not so strongly felt, ie it is ""relaxed,"" with the aim of suggesting a ""stark confrontation between a more radical aestheticism -- postmodernism -- and &nbsp;more rigidly rationalist and objectivist Enlightenement."" (49) In other words, what Hollinger thinks--and what he laid out in the Knower/Artificer article--is that modernism always included attempts by those we call modernists to reassemble a kind of way to ""know"" while confronting the problem of subjectivity. But in this postmodern ""protohistorigoraphy"" the resonance between the scientific-cognitive outlook and the problem of subjectivity is forgotten or ""evacuated."" What is lost is the ""hermeneutic sophistication of James and Dilthey, of WEber and Dewey and their contemporaries addressed in this volume and elswehere..."" (49) He drops in a quote on 49-50, showing how this sophisticated is relegated to the importance of a footnote.</span><br style=""color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;"" /><br style=""color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;"" /><span style=""color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;"">* The effect of this shift has been he thinks to further confuse--and make less useful--the label modernism beyond even the point of chaos he had found it in when he first wrote the Knower/Artifer essay. How can a term that is used to define defenders of Enlightenment also be used to describe T.S. Eliot for example. He critiques Marshall Berman who seems to have published an essay entitled ""Why Modernism Still Matters in an edited Book *Modernity and Identity* (1992) -- Berman seems from HOllinger's point of view to be linking very many people together, perhaps retaining a more flexible sense of the tensions inherent to modernism apart from the figure of moderism presneted in the posstmodernist literature, but in a way that stretches thin the sensibility of the label.</span><br style=""color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;"" /><br style=""color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;"" /><span style=""color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;"">* So again he advises abandoing the modernist-postmodernist debate. He thinks that what has happened since he wrote Knower/Artificer has simply reinforced his belief that ""the concept of cognitivism can serve us in the ways I described."" (50) He thinks it will be most useful as a term if it is understood to ""embrace a great range of science-centered strategies commonly distinguisshed from one another on the basis of epistemological and ontological doctrine."" (51) He gives an example by showing how Ian Hacking--who believes that we do come to know small portions of the world in itself--and Karl Pearson--who retreated to a more skeptical position--can be linked through a cognitivist label despite not having the same epistemological/ontological framework. Both were enthusiasitc about since.

If the term *cognitivism* is too gross to help distinguish Bacon from Hume, Mill from Pearson, or Hacking from Habermas, neither do the terms that can perform these valuable labors help to identify the science-centered program forculture that partake of, but surely do not exhaust, the Enlightenment project.

America in the Eyes of the Germans: An Essay on Anti-Americanism,"<p>General Notes 3/2013:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Preface</p>
<p>* He notes that when he's talkign about antiamericanism he is not interested in using it as a way to dismiss legitimate criticism of the United States. It is not a catch all term for him. He is interested rather in ""biased foreign pereption of America, in particular its German form and specificities."" (vii) He does not think that anti-americnaism is a specfically German phenomenon. It is, he says, a ""universal phenomenon."" (iix)</p>
<p>* He intends the books as a polemic, but at the same time he says that it is focusing on a ""discourse with a long tradition."" (iix) The materials selcted he says are ""entirely representative for the phenomenon of historically durable prejudicial images of America."" (iix) That does not mean however that Germans will ""see themselves"" in these materials. But then he says ""such moritifications are part and parcel of any critique -- in Germany and beyond."" (iix)</p>
<p>* The book was ""triggered"" by ""the reactions of the Germa public to American involvement in the Gulf War of 1991."" It was clear to him then that the images that emerged -- at a moment when there was a shift from the Cold war to a new ""unkown world"" -- were not spontaneous but had emerged from a long tradition.

<p>* He starts out with Locke's quote vv the ""New World"". ""In the beginnign, all the world was America."" from his 1690 <em>Two Treatises of Civil Government</em>. There was a second wave of such sentiment after the American Revolution. He then says that therefore the ""discovery of America resembled a founding act. The world appeared to be created anew from that moment on, to the extent that it had to be rethought."" (4)</p>
<p>* In these representations, two figures emerge. America as ""untamed nature"", that could be civilized and christianized, and America as ""innocent nature"" subsequently ruined by ""that very civilization that has since been&nbsp; named 'America' and -- today -- is ocndemned as the epitome of modernity and corrupter of the world."" (5)</p>
<p>* In these two images there is the commonality that ""America remains the counterworld to Europe, a complementary continent of occidental civilization and a screen upon which to project all the images and metaphors arising from its contrast to Europe: a screen upon which to project isolated portions of self-hate owning mainly to modernity, but blamed only on the New World.""

"Prophets of Extremity: Nietzsche, Heidegger, Foucault, Derrida","<p>Notes for Prague Metacrisis Paper</p>
<p>Goal: My goal in these notes is to focus on Megill's notion of crisis vv late nineteenth and early twentieth century thought.</p>
<p><strong>Preface</strong></p>
<p>* Right off the bat he says that his book is an interpretation of the thought of Nietzsche, Heidegger, Foucault and Derrida that seeks to place them within the ""context of a <strong>crisis-oriented</strong> modernism and post-modernism that have been the source of much of what is most original and creative in twentieth-century art and thought."" (xi)&nbsp; It's a book about modernism and post-modernism he says.</p>
<p>* The book's interpretation of the the first three thinkers he says is heavily influenced by his reaction to the last: Derrida.&nbsp; Though he emphasizes that he's not a Derridean and he's uncomfortable with Derrida's claims, esp. the political ones.&nbsp; He doesn't see Derrida as a political radical.&nbsp; (xii)&nbsp; Derrida, he says, helped him ""see my own mind clearly...[and] bring to light and to articulate long-held, deeply felt, but ...latent skepticisms concerning the claims and procedures of modernism and postmodernism in art and thought."" (xii)</p>
<p>* His focus on modernism and postmodernism he says has led him to focto us on ""the aesthetically inclined elements"" in the thinkers, ie not Nietzsche the naturalist or Heidgger the analyst of human existence, and so on... (xii)</p>
<p>* And modernism and postmodernism has led him to focus on a specific notion of crisis viz cultural crisis.&nbsp; He wants to specify what he means.&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) The crisis he's *not* talking about is the usual notion of crisis, related he says to the ""continental philosohpical tradition and out of the theology"" of that tradition... (xii)&nbsp; He means the collapse of the ""God of the Philosphers"" or the ""God of the Bible that occurs with Kant's first critique and in the Bibilical cricisim of David Friedrich Strauss and other ""practitioners of historical criticism."" (xii-xiii).&nbsp; The idea is that a ""loss of the transcendent dimension, prompted by the notion of <em>Kritik</em> as a pervasive power, leads to modern man's homelessness in the world."" (xiii)&nbsp; He says it's a loss of ""authoritative standards of the good, the true, and the beautiful to which reason has access, coupled with loss of the Word of God in the Bible."" (xiii)</p>
<p>b) The crisis he's specifying is different.&nbsp; It's the crisis of historicism, circa 1880-1920.&nbsp; Ie a crisis of ""hsitoricism and of the faith in progress that was the widely diffused, vulgarized form of historicism."" (xiii) In this crisis the dominant metaphor, unlike the theological one that he listed above that focuses on the image of the abyss, is the break: ""This presupposes something to be broken, nameyl, history; and in order to conceive of the possiblity of history's breaking, one needs to think of it as a line or a movement."" (xiii)&nbsp; So historicism in the theological notion of crisis is the product of crisis; it emerges when absolute standards dissapear and nothing is outside of history.&nbsp; The crisis of historicism is thus dependent on thinking of history as linear. Otherwise, you couldn't image in to be broken.&nbsp; Finally, he says, these kinds of crisis thinkers tend ot think of the present as borken, and so also as ""undirected, null, degraded"" And they tend to project this vision forwards and backwards. (xiii)</p>
<p>* He also calls this a ""posthistoricist notion of crisis"" rather than a ""posttheological notion"" (xiii)</p>
<p>* He makes a couple of important references to his own distance from the basic point of view of the thinkers he's writing about.&nbsp; (xiv, bottom)&nbsp; He describes Derrida as an ""antihistoricist"" and then says that his book his historicist thought.&nbsp; (xv)&nbsp; But he says his book's ""interpretive construction is aestheticist., and also therapeutic..."" (xv)&nbsp; Not clear what he nmeans, but he tries to explain below.&nbsp; Something about it creating a new world for the reader, that he hopes is also liberating and also, in his treatment of the achivement of Derrida, something that cauess ""awe and rapture before a truth unviled by Derrida..."" (xv)&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>* Def'n of Aestheticism: He's not suing it in its' usual sense where it means to be enclosed in a world that is separate from the ""real world.""&nbsp; He's referring to a it as an ""attempt to expand the aesthetic to embrace the whole of reality.&nbsp; To put it in another way, I am using it to refer to a tendency to see 'art' or 'language' or 'discourse' or 'text' as constituting the primary realm of human experience."" (2) <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>* He provides a useful and interesting summary of the modernism/post-modernism relationship vv his notion of the aesthetic: ""The irony that pervaded modernism tried to uncover a Man or Culture or Nature or History underlying the flux of surface experience.&nbsp; In postmodernism, this has given way to a new irony, one that holds these erstwhile realities to be textual fictions.&nbsp; We are seen as cut off from 'things' and confined to a confrontation with 'words' alone."" (2)</p>
<p>* This is the basic def'n of aestheticism, but the details are in the difn't modes that he'll show in the four thinkers.&nbsp; (2) &nbsp; [-- This bears a resemblance to Calinescu's <em>F</em>ive <em>Faces of Modernity</em> ???]&nbsp; He gives some elaboration using the words of his thinkers on 2-3.&nbsp;</p>
<p>* He relates his readings to a book by Stanley Rosen: <em>Nihilism: a Philophsical Essay</em>.&nbsp; He agrees with Rosen who emphasizes the role of poetics in these thinkers and who also relates the projects of these thinkers to Kan'ts third critique. (4)&nbsp; But he differs from Rosen in that he's not calling for a return to the ""classical linkage of the good, the true, and the beautiful."" (4) <strong>What is key here is that he's seeing his work as a ""study of the continuing impact on us of the thought of the Enlightenment."" (4)&nbsp; </strong>He says this because he thinks that what's going on with these thinkers is that they are reacting to ""the Enlightement pretension to construct a science of society modeled on natural science."" (4)&nbsp; And the ""intellectual problems"" that this project created are evident in Kant!&nbsp; Ie he thinks that Rosen's complaint about the isolation of reason, the good, and beauty is ""translatable into a complaint about the Kantian separation of the practical, the theoretical, and the aesthetic."" (4)&nbsp; <strong>This is key because he's saying that this crisis of historicism or posthistoricist crisis is an after effect of the enlightement project of creating a science of society</strong>...one that is visible esp in Kant's project--which can be seen to have had both a positive and negative impact..(Later of course, Megill will trace the aehsetic idea to the autonomy that Kant gave to aeshetics..)</p>
<p>* The rebellion against Kant ties these thinkers to Romanticism , one of hte first movement to identify the ""failure"" of the Enlightenment, to react to Kant, and to use his own tools to fight him (7).&nbsp; He insists that despite the variety of Romaniticisms, they viewed the Enlightenment as having failed to ""provide the hoped-for synthesis"" and thus their period was a period of transition involved in a confrontation with that failure. (6-7)&nbsp; This view syncs with what he said vv Enlightenent and crisis on (4)</p>
<p>* Second point of contact with the Romantics is the elevation of the aesthetic, the idea that art was elevated even above the artist: ""As the objective embodiment of fleeting, inarticulate insight, art was seen as allowing access to a dimension of reality from which the merely analytical understanding was entirely barred."" (7)&nbsp; This attitude also connects to the thinkers he's looking at.&nbsp; He deals with difficulties of making this link between Romantics and his thinkers on 8-9.&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Developing his Kant link further.&nbsp; He thinks Kant is key because he ""stands as the crucial figure between the Enlightenment, Romanticism, and the new thought initiated by Nietzsche."" (9)&nbsp; Megill states that ""In Nietzsche's eyes, Kant was a deeply subversive thinker, who had unwittingly underminded the optimistic logic of the Enlightenment."" (9)&nbsp; He argues that Kant pplays a huge role in th ewritings of Heidegger, Foucault and Derrida.&nbsp; As wella s for the Romantics.&nbsp; Megill describes Kant as an ""ambivalent philosopher"" and focuses on the tension between his first and second critiques, the <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em> (1781) and the <em>Critique of Practical Reason</em> (1788).&nbsp; The internals of these theories is not the point for Megil, but rather ""the more general problem of the relationship of the two theories to each other..."" (9-10)&nbsp; This was a problem felt by the Romantics deeply.&nbsp; The problem highlights a contradiction inherent to the Enlightenment project itself, as begun by Descartes.&nbsp; The problem is as follows: The background is the idea that the Enlightenment was to construct a science of society on the model of the Natural sciences.&nbsp; Newton, e.g. had done this with his theory of universal gravitation.&nbsp; The problem was, as Megill states it, that ""Natural science attributes a determinism to the objects of its concern.&nbsp; [But] If things were free rather than determined, they could not be the objects of science."" (10)&nbsp; If Enlightenment thinkers wanted to construct a science of society, then they would be admitting that individuals were not free, but rather their actions were determined by laws, just like those that determined the movement of the planets and the stars.&nbsp; The problem was that Enlightenment philosophers also believed in moral codes.&nbsp; ""But the existence of a moral code presupposes that people are free to govern their own actions, since entities incapable of governing their own actions obviously cannot be judged in moral terms."" (10)&nbsp; Megill also restates this in a useful way, stating that one can see science as dealing with a realm of unfree objects and morality (religion?) as dealing with a realm of free objects.&nbsp; Kant, like Descartes, whom he also criticizes, operates with the assumption that there is a stark division between subject and object (the relam of freedom and the realm of unfreedom, or morality and science), but because he deals with the subject of morality directly he reveals, Megill argues, the deep contradiction in the Enlightenment project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Heidegger, Nietzsche, and Foucault, are all frustrated with this subject/object division, as were Romantics like Fichte, Schilling, and Hegel.&nbsp; the German idealisets, eh says, were all trying to ""attain a unity of subject and object, of ego and non-ego."" (11)</p>
<p>* Kant himself suggests, Megill says, severral ways out of the dilemma, but the only one that he's concerned with is that which Kant laid out in the third critique, <em>The Critique of the Power of Judgement, </em>which he says is the least powerful performance of Kant's but nonetheless had a huge impact, in partiuclar on the Romantics.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because it ""unequivocally maintains the autonomy of the aesthetic judgement.&nbsp; In doing so, it appears to suggest that there exists an indepedent realm of the aesthetic, a realm quite distinct from the other realms of morality and nature. "" (11-12)&nbsp; Megill positions Kant as making a stand, on the one hand, against Hutchesoin and Shaftesbury who had linked aesthetic and moral judgement and thus ""in effect assimilated the former to the latter"" (12), and those like Saint-Evremond and La Mettrie, who had linked aesthetic pleasure to sensual pleasure via physiology and psychology, on the other hand. (12)&nbsp; The divergence here is made in Kant's idea of the ""disinterestedness"" of aesthetic pleasure.&nbsp; Megill says Kant denies the existence of a third realm apart form nature and freedom, but he does insist on the ""existence of an autonomuos realm of the aesthetic, a realm whose function is to mediate bretween the other two."" (12)&nbsp;</p>
<p>*Finally, also essential to Kant's view on aeshetics is the relationship of beauty/art to truth.&nbsp; Because art/aesthetics operates in an autonomous domain it does not immediatley have truth value -- ie it is a realm of disinterested pleasure.&nbsp; BUT although art cannot produce knowledge, Kant hitns that the beautiful may put us into contact or point toward somethign that cannot be known conceptually or through experience.&nbsp; When someone says something is beautiful they are not only registered a disitnerested pleasure but also the idea that that delight should be ""necessary and universal."" (12)&nbsp; Megill explains that in the finals stages of his ""transcendental deduction of the judgement of taste"" Kant touches on the issue of morality, because he suggests that ""underlying the judgemetn of aesthetic taste is the concept of the purposiveness of nature."" (12) Ie ""teleology"" ??&nbsp; Megill quotes Kant as saying that the ""determining ground"" of the concept of purposiveness in nature ""lies perhaps in the concept of that which may be regarded as the supersensible substrate of humanity."" (quoted on 12-13).&nbsp; That substrate, Megill says, is the one that he uncovers in the <em>Critique of Practical Reason</em>, so that beauty becomes Kant argues ""the symbol of the morally good."" (quoted on 13)&nbsp; Ie it indicates the existence of the morally good, stimulates the cultivation of reason as he says in his letter quoted in Guyer's ""Editor's Introduction"" on xvi in the <em>Critique of the Power of Judgement</em>.&nbsp; Beauty thus leads the individual toward universal reason/morality through disinterested aehsetic delight.&nbsp; Megill says: ""Beauty thsu points towards the realm of morality, of which it gives sensual intimations."" (13)</p>
<p>* Also key to the idea that aesthetics are autonomous is Kant's idea of an ""aeshetic idea"" Megill says.&nbsp; He quotes Kant this way: ""An 'aesthetic idea' is a 'representation of the imagination which occasions much thought' but for which 'an adequate concept can never be found,' and which consequently 'cannot be completely encompassed and made intelligibile by language.'"" (13)</p>
<p>* So to sum up: the aesthetic is autonomous, associated with a disinterested and sensual aesthetic pleasure, but it also points toward a kind of experience that cannot be articulated in language, and which is related to the underlying ""substratum"" of moral law that governs free subjects.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>* Megill reiterates his idea that these thinkers are reaction to the Enlightenment idea of structuring science on a natural science model.&nbsp; He states that he thinks much of ""modern Western intellectual history has up to now been mainly defineed by the thought of the Enlightenment."" (340)&nbsp; He notes also that even in the East ""current intellectual debates in, say, India or China often have an eerily nineteenth-century quality to them."" (340)&nbsp; Ie he thinks an ""unquestioning faith in such Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment values as science and progress."" (340) BUT now he says he thinks that ""the primacy of the Enlightenment--its importance in setting the terms of our discourse will not continue much longer."" (340)&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; He says you can think of four ""deconstructive"" moments emerging out of Enlightenment thought: Descartes, Kant, Hegel, and then perhaps Nietzsche.&nbsp; He notes taht Marxism was the most enduring ""remnant"" of the nineteenth century dialectic -- ""embodying a Cartesian faith in science, a Kantian faith in human nature, and an Hegelian faith in reason and history."" (341)&nbsp; But now he notes even Marxism is in crisis and his point is that this has to do with a general ""crisis of the Enlightenment"", which in turn is connected to a ""persistent failure of our institutions to live up to expectation."" (341)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Here is where these thinkers come in: he thinks they are and Nietzsche and Heidegger potentially going to play an important role in this ""important transformation in the history of ideas"" going beyond the Enlightenment. (341)&nbsp; There are those he says who think they can dismiss these thinkers and the best criticism he sees is the one which argues taht the ""overlook or totally misconstrue the truly pressing realities of human life."" (341)&nbsp; This is due to an ""idealism"" that's part of their thought, and he notes that Rorty has made a link between nineteenth-century idealism and twentieth-century textualism that he finds compelling if too sketchily drawn.&nbsp; (341)&nbsp; But he thinks this is something like throwing the baby out with the bathwater.&nbsp; Specifically, he thinks that these thinkers contain an ""edifying"" discourse that is usefull in that, again using Rorty, it ""takes us out of our old selves by the power of strangeness, to aid us in becoming new beings."" (341)&nbsp; He calls this <em>ekstasis</em> and defines it as ""that imaginative ability that we possess to transcend our own situations, to get outside ourselves in time and space."" (341)&nbsp; Ekstasis he claism is also ""the capacity...that enables us to function as moral beings, allow us to se<em>e ourselves</em> in the guise of those upon whom we act."" (341) Yet it is the kind of project, he thinks, that's been left out of sociology entirely--actually he thinks ""excluded.""&nbsp; And he thinks his prophets of extremity are ""committed to ending this exclusion or repression."" (342)</p>
<p>* He also restates what these poeple are about differently here vv the Kant theme of the separation between ideas and experience.&nbsp; Ie he refers to the fact that the attempt ""to reintegrate what in the Enlightenment view remains divided answers a widely felt need."" (342)&nbsp; This needs in what Nietzsche and Heidegger are dealing with... What he means by the idea that the Enlightenment project will cease to be so influential is that for a long time since the 18th century the most significant intellectual projects have tried to ""provide better, more detailed, more sophisticated answers to questions first raised by eighteenth-century philosophers.""&nbsp; He doesn't think this will last.&nbsp; He thinks rather that now ""in the future it will be a matter of developign or criticizing the thought that Nietzsche and Heidegger have given us."" (342)&nbsp; Foucualt and Derrida are doing just that.</p>
<p>* What is aestheticism then?&nbsp; -- this thing that Nietzsche and Heidegger laid out.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>He now says that in its essence it's about ""an attempt to bring back into thought and into our lives that form of edification, that reawakening of <em>ekstasis</em>, which in the Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment view as been largely confined to the realm of art."" (342)</li>
<li>Ontologically, he says it's the idea that ""the world"" is a ""work of art that gives birth to itself"" -- or in another formulation, in the conviction that ""the world itself is nothing other than art."" (quoted, the latter is Nietzsche, from 342)</li>
<li>This cocneption leads in two direction: 1) passive contemplation; 2) radical creativity -- here the reference is ot the creativity of the genius artist who creates from nothing and who stands as the ""successor to the radical creativity of God."" (343)&nbsp; The poet brings the wrold into existence; discourse creates its own world.&nbsp; The latter is an important sub-theme in Nietzsche of 1880s and also Heidegger.&nbsp; (343)&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>* Megill says that one would have to be mad to believe literally in these theses, and eh thinks it's clear that these ideas are not to be taken literally even thought the rhetorical affect of the theses requires that they be taken seriously.&nbsp; Here is the paradox of aestheticism he says. He quotes Schiller to the effect that the ""aesthetic semblance"" is never in danger of being taken for truth, but Megill says that is false!&nbsp; He notes on the next few pages how many of the students of Foucault or Nietzsche have tken their lcaims as truth, wheraes he insists they never meant for that to be done!&nbsp; )(343) He undercuts or specifies the idea of the ""truth of the work of art""--that idea he thinks is just protection for the interpreter of the work of art e""protecting trhem form the critical examiation to which they ought to be subjected."" (344)&nbsp; But if we are suspicious of this idea of the truth of art, we must also be suspicious of the ""creative lie"" that is key to Nietzsche.&nbsp; The same problem occurs: the ""creative lie"" can be seen as true whereas it is in fact a reflection of the writers unexamined prejudices.&nbsp; He thinks the danger in this is esp. clear with Foucault when his claims are applied in a way to take them seriously then the ""view that everything is discourse or text or fiction, [then] the <em>realia </em>are trivialized."" (345)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* So one should read these prophets of extremity with Irony!! he says.&nbsp; Not literally.&nbsp; Viewing their owrk as we do the work of artists.&nbsp; (345)&nbsp; He sees, e.g., Foucault as the ""dobule of conventional historians, who challeng, and aought to be challenged by, his work."" (345)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Crisis: he thinks similarly to the way in which we ought to be suspicious of the notion of radical creativity and the truth of art we ought also to be suspicious of the concept of crisis articulated by Nietzsche and Heidegger.&nbsp; Several points here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Logical critique: these theorists of crisis presuppose the idea of History as structured and linear in order to say it is borken.&nbsp; ""Hence, to the extent that the proponents of the crisis notion are successful in making their point, they undermine the basis of their own view."" (346)&nbsp;</li>
<li>Rhetorically, the notion of a ""crisis of our time"" has become a substitute for thought rather than a prompt to thought.&nbsp; (3460</li>

(10)&nbsp; If Enlightenment thinkers wanted to construct a science of society, then they would be admitting that individuals were not free, but rather their actions were determined by laws, just like those that determined the movement of the planets and the stars.&nbsp; The problem was that Enlightenment philosphers also believed in moral codes.&nbsp; ""But the existence of a moral code presupposes that people are free to govern their own actions, since entities incapable of governing their own actions obviously cannot be judged in moral terms."" (10)&nbsp; Megill also restates this in a useful way, stating that one can see science as dealing with a realm of unfree objects and morality (religion?) as dealing with a realm of free objects.&nbsp; Kant, like Descartes, whom he also criticizes, operates with the assumption that there is a stark division between subject and object (the relam of freedom and the realm of unfreedom, or morality and science), but because he deals with the subject of morality directly he reveals, Megill argues, the deep contradiction in the Enlightenment project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Heidegger, Nietzsche, and Foucault, are all frustrated with this subject/object division, as were Romantics like Fichte, Schilling, and Hegel.&nbsp; the German idealisets, eh says, were all trying to ""attain a unity of subject and object, of ego and non-ego."" (11)</p>
<p>* Kant himself suggests, Megill says, severral ways out of the dilemma, but the only one that he's concerned with is that which Kant laid out in the third critique, <em>The Critique of the Power of Judgement, </em>which he says is the least powerful performance of Kant's but nonetheless had a huge impact, in partiuclar on the Romantics.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because it ""unequivocally maintains the autonomy of the aesthetic judgement.&nbsp; In doing so, it appears to suggest that there exists an indepedent realm of the aesthetic, a realm quite distinct from the other realms of morality and nature. "" (11-12)&nbsp; Megill positions Kant as making a stand, on the one hand, against Hutchesoin and Shaftesbury who had linked aesthetic and moral judgement and thus ""in effect assimilated the former to the latter"" (12), and those like Saint-Evremond and La Mettrie, who had linked aesthetic pleasure to sensual pleasure via physiology and psychology, on the other hand. (12)&nbsp; The divergence here is made in Kant's idea of the ""disinterestedness"" of aesthetic pleasure.&nbsp; Megill says Kant denies the existence of a third realm apart form nature and freedom, but he does insist on the ""existence of an autonomuos realm of the aesthetic, a realm whose function is to mediate bretween the other two."" (12)&nbsp;</p>
<p>*Finally, also essential to Kant's view on aeshetics is the relationship of beauty/art to truth.&nbsp; Because art/aesthetics operates in an autonomous domain it does not immediatley have truth value -- ie it is a realm of disinterested pleasure.&nbsp; BUT although art cannot produce knowledge, Kant hitns that the beautiful may put us into contact or point toward somethign that cannot be known conceptually or through experience.&nbsp; When someone says something is beautiful they are not only registered a disitnerested pleasure but also the idea that that delight should be ""necessary and universal."" (12)&nbsp; Megill explains that in the finals stages of his ""transcendental deduction of the judgement of taste"" Kant touches on the issue of morality, because he suggests that ""underlying the judgemetn of aesthetic taste is the concept of the purposiveness of nature."" (12) Ie ""teleology"" ??&nbsp; Megill quotes Kant as saying that the ""determining ground"" of the concept of purposiveness in nature ""lies perhaps in the ocncept of that which may be regarded as the supersensible substrate of humanity."" (quoted on 12-13).&nbsp; That substrate, Megill says, is the one that he uncovers in the <em>Critique of Practical Reason</em>, so that beauty becomes Kant argues ""the symbol of the morally good."" (quoted on 13)&nbsp; Ie it indicates the existence of the morally good, stimulates the cultivation of reason as he says in his letter quoted in Guyer's ""Editor's Introduction"" on xvi in the <em>Critique of the Power of Judgement</em>.&nbsp; Beauty thus leads the individual toward universal reason/morality through disinterested aehsetic delight.&nbsp; Megill says: ""Beauty thsu points towards the realm of morality, of which it gives sensual intimations."" (13)</p>
<p>* Also key to the idea that aesthetics are autonomous is Kant's idea of an ""aeshetic idea"" Megill says.&nbsp; He quotes Kant this way: ""An 'aehsetic idea' is a 'representation of the imagination which occasions much thought' but for which 'an adequate concept can never be found,' and which consequently 'cannot be completely encompassed and made intelligibile by language.'"" (13)</p>
<p>* So to sum up: the aesthetic is autonomous, associated with a disinterested and sensual aesthetic pleasure, but it also points toward a kind of experience that cannot be articulated in language, and which is related to the underlying ""substratum"" of moral law that governs free subjects.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>* Megill reiterates his idea that these thinkers are reaction to the Enlightenment idea of structuring science on a natural science model.&nbsp; He states that he thinks much of ""modern Western intellectual history has up to now been mainly defineed by the thought of the Enlightenment."" (340)&nbsp; He notes also that even in the East ""current intellectual debates in, say, India or China often have an eerily nineteenth-century quality to them."" (340)&nbsp; Ie he thinks an ""unquestioning faith in such Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment values as science and progress."" (340) BUT now he says he thinks that ""the primacy of the Enlightenment--its importance in setting the terms of our discourse will not continue much longer."" (340)&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; He says you can think of four ""deconstructive"" moments emerging out of Enlightenment thought: Descartes, Kant, Hegel, and then perhaps Nietzsche.&nbsp; He notes taht Marxism was the most enduring ""remnant"" of the nineteenth century dialectic -- ""embodying a Cartesian faith in science, a Kantian faith in human nature, and an Hegelian faith in reason and history."" (341)&nbsp; But now he notes even Marxism is in crisis and his point is that this has to do with a general ""crisis of the Enlightenment"", which in turn is connected to a ""persistent failure of our institutions to live up to expectation."" (341)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Here is where these thinkers come in: he thinks they are and Nietzsche and Heidegger potentially going to play an important role in this ""important transformation in the history of ideas"" going beyond the Enlightenment. (341)&nbsp; There are those he says who think they can dismiss these thinkers and the best criticism he sees is the one which argues taht the ""overlook or totally misconstrue the truly pressing realities of human life."" (341)&nbsp; This is due to an ""idealism"" that's part of their thought, and he notes that Rorty has made a link between nineteenth-century idealism and twentieth-century textualism that he finds compelling if too sketchily drawn.&nbsp; (341)&nbsp; But he thinks this is something like throwing the baby out with the bathwater.&nbsp; Specifically, he thinks that these thinkers contain an ""edifying"" discourse that is usefull in that, again using Rorty, it ""takes us out of our old selves by the power of strangeness, to aid us in becoming new beings."" (341)&nbsp; He calls this <em>ekstasis</em> and defines it as ""that imaginative ability that we possess to transcend our own situations, to get outside ourselves in time and space."" (341)&nbsp; Ekstasis he claism is also ""the capacity...that enables us to function as moral beings, allow us to se<em>e ourselves</em> in the guise of those upon whom we act."" (341) Yet it is the kind of project, he thinks, that's been left out of sociology entirely--actually he thinks ""excluded.""&nbsp; And he thinks his prophets of extremity are ""committed to ending this exclusion or repression."" (342)</p>
<p>* He also restates what these poeple are about differently here vv the Kant theme of the separation between ideas and experience.&nbsp; Ie he refers to the fact that the attempt ""to reintegrate what in the Enlightenment view remains divided answers a widely felt need."" (342)&nbsp; This needs in what Nietzsche and Heidegger are dealing with... What he means by the idea that the Enlightenment project will cease to be so influential is that for a long time since the 18th century the most significant intellectual projects have tried to ""provide better, more detailed, more sophisticated answers to questions first raised by eighteenth-century philosophers.""&nbsp; He doesn't think this will last.&nbsp; He thinks rather that now ""in the future it will be a matter of developign or criticizing the thought that Nietzsche and Heidegger have given us."" (342)&nbsp; Foucualt and Derrida are doing just that.</p>
<p>* What is aestheticism then?&nbsp; -- this thing that Nietzsche and Heidegger laid out.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>He now says that in its essence it's about ""an attempt to bring back into thought and into our lives that form of edification, that reawakening of <em>ekstasis</em>, which in the Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment view as been largely confined to the realm of art."" (342)</li>
<li>Ontologically, he says it's the idea that ""the world"" is a ""work of art that gives birth to itself"" -- or in another formulation, in the conviction that ""the world itself is nothing other than art."" (quoted, the latter is Nietzsche, from 342)</li>
<li>This cocneption leads in two direction: 1) passive contemplation; 2) radical creativity -- here the reference is ot the creativity of the genius artist who creates from nothing and who stands as the ""successor to the radical creativity of God."" (343)&nbsp; The poet brings the wrold into existence; discourse creates its own world.&nbsp; The latter is an important sub-theme in Nietzsche of 1880s and also Heidegger.&nbsp; (343)&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>* Megill says that one would have to be mad to believe literally in these theses, and eh thinks it's clear that these ideas are not to be taken literally even thought the rhetorical affect of the theses requires that they be taken seriously.&nbsp; Here is the paradox of aestheticism he says. He quotes Schiller to the effect that the ""aesthetic semblance"" is never in danger of being taken for truth, but Megill says that is false!&nbsp; He notes on the next few pages how many of the students of Foucault or Nietzsche have tken their lcaims as truth, wheraes he insists they never meant for that to be done!&nbsp; )(343) He undercuts or specifies the idea of the ""truth of the work of art""--that idea he thinks is just protection for the interpreter of the work of art e""protecting trhem form the critical examiation to which they ought to be subjected."" (344)&nbsp; But if we are suspicious of this idea of the truth of art, we must also be suspicious of the ""creative lie"" that is key to Nietzsche.&nbsp; The same problem occurs: the ""creative lie"" can be seen as true whereas it is in fact a reflection of the writers unexamined prejudices.&nbsp; He thinks the danger in this is esp. clear with Foucault when his claims are applied in a way to take them seriously then the ""view that everything is discourse or text or fiction, [then] the <em>realia </em>are trivialized."" (345)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* So one should read these prophets of extremity with Irony!! he says.&nbsp; Not literally.&nbsp; Viewing their owrk as we do the work of artists.&nbsp; (345)&nbsp; He sees, e.g., Foucault as the ""dobule of conventional historians, who challeng, and aought to be challenged by, his work."" (345)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Crisis: he thinks similarly to the way in which we ought to be suspicious of the notion of radical creativity and the truth of art we ought also to be suspicious of the concept of crisis articulated by Nietzsche and Heidegger.&nbsp; Several points here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Logical critique: these theorists of crisis presuppose the idea of History as structured and linear in order to say it is borken.&nbsp; ""Hence, to the extent that the proponents of the crisis notion are successful in making their point, they undermine the basis of their own view."" (346)&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Rhetorically, the notion of a ""crisis of our time"" has become a substitute for thought rather than a prompt to thought.&nbsp; (346)&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Pragmatic critiuqe: even if there is a crisis, so what?&nbsp; what difference?&nbsp; He think it makes no difference whatsoever.&nbsp; Even if the seies of pragmatic problems that we face are linked to the ""Death of God"", so what?&nbsp; ""The problem with the crisis notion is that it can only speak in vague generalities."" (347)&nbsp;</li>
<li>Here he thinks these prophets of extremity are maybe unhelpful because they are beleivers in apocalypse generally.&nbsp; ""Heidegger's conviction that only a god can save use is harldy calculated to help us evade the crisis of which he speaks; Foucault's belief in unendign protest--his hostility to every order--may only move us closer to disaster."" (347)</li>
</ul>
<p>* In sum, he thinks the crisis concept may be in crisis -- here he's referring to the notion of crisis of historicism--not the first notio of crisis out of which Enlightenment emerged. Waht he's referrign to his how combining the three critiques above, these thinkers notion of crisis has not been useful.&nbsp; The concept hsa instead moved into the hands of fundamenalists, e.g. in America, for whom crisis viz apocalypse is an ancient mythical theme tied to the ""crisis of the City of Man--its destruction, making way for the City of God..."" (347) -- and all out war between good and evil and so on.&nbsp; He thinks that Nietzsche, Heidegger and Foucault cannot be held responsible for such views but they too were fascinated by crisis.&nbsp; and its ""cleansing power.""&nbsp; But if we don't think the present is totally degraded, Megill suggests, ""there ought to be compulsion to actively oppose the crisis notion."" (348)</p>
<p>* Yet he also thinks the Prophets of Extremity are uesful because their thought critiques the idea of ""one true way""...and this is useful he thinks in the context of a moment when the weaponry exists (he's also writing still during the Cold War) to actually end the wrold.&nbsp; In this context, the unermining of the idea of one true way is useful.&nbsp; (348-9)&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Body of the book...</strong></p>
<p><strong>(no notes yet on earlier chapters...)</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /><strong>Part IV. On the Meaning of Jacques Derrida</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ch.7.&nbsp; The Deconstruction of Crisis</strong></p>
<p>* Derrida he describes interestingly as the ""modern Penelope, unraveling by night what he weaves by day--or rather, raveling and unraveling at the same time, as he waits for a Ulysses who will never come home."" (259)&nbsp;&nbsp; In comparison to the other thinkers, Derrida is more radically ironic he says. (260)&nbsp;</p>
<p>*&nbsp; He starts out by trying to evaluate why modernism and postmodernism are useful.&nbsp; He says he holds no ""brief"" for these movements.&nbsp; Meaning he's not pushing them and he's not also saying that we all ought to be modernists and postmodernists because these movements have been so important for the twentieth century avante-garde.&nbsp; But he thinks they are ""imporant aspects of our historical and intellectual experience."" (261)&nbsp; And he thinks their assumptions have been carried into ""areas of thought that we do not usually think of"" in aesthetic terms--ie the implications of tehse ideas extends outside of the realm of art.&nbsp; (261).&nbsp; He says he will draw out the latter point esp in ch.8.&nbsp; (261)</p>
<p>* He lays out the influence of Derridean thought on so-called postmodern literary criticism in the 1980s on 262-3, but he's not particularly interested in this consequence, which is mainly that those who use these ideas in literarture believe that ""interpretation is really only a variety of misinterpretation."" (262) He's only interested in a part of this debate.</p>
<p>* So why is he interested in Derrida?&nbsp; He says on to pof 262 that he thinks Derrida's thought needs to be considered in a wider perspective.&nbsp; He sees the key issue being wrapped up in the question ""what is a work of art?"" (263)&nbsp; Derrida 's work can be seen as ""an important exploration of this question."" (263)&nbsp; We live in a ""post-Kantian world"" ie in the shadows of Kant's distinctions between the theoretical, the practical, and the aesthetic, out of which comes also the distinction between theory and praxis and a distinction between the aesthetic and the nonaesthetic.&nbsp; Derrida is esp. (interested in attacking the latter dualism between the aesthetic and nonaesthetic (or art and reality) -- a dualism that typically for modernists like Yeats, Pound and Eliot (and also for the so-called ""New Critics"") was key! <strong>Postmodernism is anti-Kantian in this sense because it calls into question the distinction between art and reality.&nbsp; Derrida too calls this distinction into question although Megill will argue that <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">he is not postmodern<em>, despite the obvious affinities</em></span></strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Caveat re Kant:&nbsp; It is wrong to say that Kant's view of art was aesthetic or to say that he was ""unequivocally asserting art's autonomy."" (264)&nbsp; But it is fair to say that his ""<em>Critique of Judgement </em>did point in these directions, and the direction was taken up by Kant's successors , beginning with Schiller.&nbsp; A separate sphere was carved out for art; a division between the aesthetic and the nonaesthetic was established and canonized."" (264)</p>
<p>* In this context, Nietzsche lays out a reactive response to that idea of the autonomy of art. ""There exist artists of art; there also exist artists of politics, science, religion."" (264)&nbsp; Once with Nietzsche you recognize the ""affinity between aesthetic creativity and creativity in its more 'serious' sense"", then you begin to see that the separation of art from reality covers up a lot of questions.&nbsp; (264)&nbsp; The idea is taht artists have had a hand in the construction of reality; as Shelley put it in ""Defence of Poetry,"" poets are ""the unacknowledged legislators of the world..."" (264)&nbsp; Two often intermingled misperceptions emerge from this view: the ""aesthetic"" view that sees art as ""simply an internal play of formal possibilities"" (264) and the ""ontological"" view of art as a privileged from of truth.&nbsp; (265) Combined these two misperceptions make it possile to view what is initially thought of as a self-contained sand inward aesthetic universe as having ""cognitive authority"" about the wrold at large.&nbsp; (265) He cites Northrop Frye as an example of this in f.n. #10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So Derrida is good:</p>
<p>#1 So the first value of Derrida according&nbsp; to Megill is that he makes it impsosible to sustain this view: ""...he so radically undermines the Kantian distinction between art and reality that we can no longer view it in any way except ironically.&nbsp; He shows us that it is not a matter of opting either for 'realism' against 'aestheticism' or for 'aestheticism' against 'realism.'&nbsp; It is a matter, rather, of calling into question the initial distinction upon which such a choice is founded."" (265) Key here is the fact that Megill sees Kant's thought as ""suggesting"" a solution to the problem of the division between art and reality: namely the ""reinterpretation of knowledge as a form of aesthetic fiction or creativity..."" which then becomes central to Nietzsche and Heidegger and Derrida, even though he undoes it.</p>
<p>#2 Aestheticism has a precondition in the idea of crisis , Megill says.&nbsp; ""The notion that the prsent is null opens the way to an aesthetic creation.&nbsp; The world's giving birth to itself as work of art presupposes that its present existence is derelict, that it indeed needs to be reborn...Art best exercices its <em>ex nihilo</em> creativity whre there is a nullity out of which this creation can emerge."" (265)&nbsp; This is tied up with Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Foucault's utopianism and sense of alienation from the ""modern world.""&nbsp; They ""want to make a leap into a utopia that radically negates this reality... (265)&nbsp; Thus there's a nihilism in this sense of crisis that is the precondition for aestheticism,b ut this nihilism is itself only a problem, Megill says, ""within the context of an historicist reading of history."" (265)&nbsp; He defines historicism: it's a sense of hsitory having a ""directionality"" as being a development that one can understand.&nbsp; Crisis ""denotes a turning,a&nbsp; point of decision.""&nbsp; (264)&nbsp; He refers to its original meaning vv disease and quotes the OED where it is a turning point that is crucial in terms of the body healing itself.&nbsp; But his poitn is that unless you first conceive of history has having direction that it cannot lose, you cannot form this notion of ""crisis."" (266)&nbsp; <strong>Derrida shows how questionable is the idea of history having directionality in the first place<em>.&nbsp; </em></strong></p>
<p>* In section 267-271, Megill explains Derrida's relationship to Nietzsche, Heidegger, Foucault and Hegel.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>D identifies Nietzsche as a ""crisis thinker"" who is functioning outside ""the tradition"" (I think he means the Enlightenment tradition).&nbsp; D understands that N got outside of that tradition by making what Megill calls the ""aestheticist move,"" which D understands to be the ""liberation of the signifier from its dependence or derivation with respect to the logos and the related concept of truth or the primary signified..."" (quoted on 268).&nbsp; Megill explains: ""There is the idea, here, of a text liberated from its formerly subordinate status with regard to Truth, with regard to the 'original' or 'transcendental' signified.&nbsp; This is why reading and writing become 'originary' operations: they involve not the 'discovery' of truth but its invention.&nbsp; The text is endowed with the attributes of the work of art as conceived in post-Romantic aesthetics..."" (269)&nbsp;</li>
<li>vv Heidegger is important for Derrida but he's not a Heideggerian.&nbsp; In <em>Positions, </em>Derrida says he thinks that Heidegger is defending in a powerful way ""what I attempt to put into quetion under the ribric of the <em>thought of presence</em>."" (269) But he is aware of teh moral ambiguities of Heidegger's thought and he wants in particular, Megill thinks, to resit the element of nostalgia in Heidegger that Megill identifies in his section on Heidegger as perhaps the place where Heidegger got himself into trouble.&nbsp; Derrida plays Nietzsche off Heidegger in ""Differance"" Megill says, quoting: ""There will be no unique name, even if it were the name of Being.&nbsp; And we must think this without <em>nostalgia</em>; that is, outside of the myth of a purely maternal or paternal language, a lost native country of thought.&nbsp; On the contrary, we must <em>affirm </em>this, in the sense in which Nietzsche puts affirmation in to play, in a certain laughter and a certaiun step of the dance."" (quoted on 260-270). Megill adds that whereas Heidegger is concerned with discovering the ""proper"" names, Derrida is ""concerned not with 'proper' names but with 'improper' ones..."" (270)</li>
<li>In relation to Foucault, Derrida sees Foucault--who was evidentl his teacher at one point--as another crisis thinker.&nbsp; Megill adds that the divergence between Derrida and Foucault is not in in ""Derrida's entrapment in the 'text,' as distinguished from Foucault's concern with the broader field of 'history'.""&nbsp; It is instead in ""their different patternings of the historical process."" (270) Derrida states re Foucault's <em>History of Madness</em> that ""nowhere else and never beter has the concept of <em>crisis</em> been able to enrich and reassemble all its potentialities, all the energy of its meaning as much, perhaps, as in Michel Foucault's boook."" (270-271)&nbsp; Megill thinks D is right and that thsi is also true in F's alter texts.&nbsp; Megill notest hat ""Foucult seeks to build a politics (or metapolitics) of crisis.""&nbsp; While Derrida's ""real interest, especially in his later work, seems to be in opening us up to the hermeneutical possibilities of the written word--using the term ""hermenuetical"" in Rorty's rather than Schleirmacher's sense, as a continuing conversation rather than as an unveiling of truth.&nbsp; And beyond this, Derrida engages in a sustained attempt to criticize the notion of crisis, to show the limitations of the crisis view."" (271)&nbsp;</li>
<li>Hegel.&nbsp; Megill says that it is Hegel that ""makes possible the thought of crisis.""&nbsp; (271)&nbsp; [HOW SO?&nbsp; Has he explained this elsewhere?]&nbsp; Hegelianism is persistnat target for Derrida apparently.&nbsp; e.g. in a 1967 essay on Bataille and Hegel.&nbsp; Where he says ""Misconstrued, treated lightly, Hegelianism only extends to its historical domination, finally unfolding its immense envoloping resources without obstacle.&nbsp; Hegelian self-evidence seems lighter than ever at the moment when it finally bears down with its full weight."" (271)&nbsp; Megill says that D deploys a kind of ironic critique of the dialectic. D's ""anti-Hegilian strategy"" M says can be ""characterized as a perpetual witholding operation."" (273) All his writing is ""preforatory"" and avoids conclusino.&nbsp; Megill writes: ""A logorrehea results, an immense outpouring of words around an unsayable center."" (272)&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>* M goes deeper into this strategy of perpetual withholding in the next section on ""The rule of four.""&nbsp; The basic idea is that ""four"" is a key part of that strategy.&nbsp; The Preforatory text is the ""fourth"" moment of the dialectic that undoes the dialectic is the idea.&nbsp; The dialectic is triangular: position, negation, and negation of negation.&nbsp; The fourth mooment is the ""preface""&nbsp; and it is an undoing of the ""trinatory horizon,"" which is a key motif (M says motif rather than theme suits D better) in D's thought.&nbsp; <strong>So: ""The fourth moment of the dialectic is the deconstructive moment: position, negation, negation of the negation, deconstruction (or: Nietzsche, Heidegger, Foucault, and Derrida.)"" (274)</strong>&nbsp; So M says that D ""engages in fore-thinking, or four-thinking, that ie explictily driected against the three-thinking of Hegel."" (274)&nbsp; (272-4)</p>
<p>* The next section is complex and seeks to situation Derrida's thought in the special context of Parisian and French thought in the 1940s and 1950s.&nbsp; Might need to re-read here, but the part that resonated most was when he explains the interest in Hegel and Marx vv ""history"".&nbsp; Megill writes: ""sensitized to hsitory by the massive congruence of Hegel and Marx, French phenomenologists approached Husserl in the hope of deriving from him a phenomenology of history."" (278)&nbsp; This led to a question of how ""history is to be understood phenomenologically""--something that Megill thinks Derrida is taking up in an early essay.&nbsp; (see bottom 278)&nbsp; So this was an interesting in how to udnerstand history,b ut it was also accompanied, M says, by an interest or preoccupation about the ""possibility of its <em>end.</em>""&nbsp; (279)&nbsp; This came out of Hegel who had a notion of philosophy's end which in some cases was construed as an end of history itself.&nbsp; (279)&nbsp; There was an influential account of an end of history in Hegel in by Kojeve.&nbsp; Also coming otu of Heidegger's essay ""The End of Philosphy and the Task of Thinking."" (279)&nbsp;&nbsp; Megill says that the idea of ""end"" is tied up with ""crisis.""&nbsp; End does not need to lead to crisis always; there can always be smooth transitions, but he says strangely that this had not often been the acse in the 20th century so it was possible to link crisis with end.&nbsp; And in the 1960s he also notes there was a lot of talk of an end of philosophy.&nbsp; He quotes someone named Descombes:&nbsp; ""It was thought that the Western <em>ratio</em>, its resources exhausted, was nearing the end of its run."" (279)&nbsp; He references's Jean Wahl's <em>Toward the end of Ontology</em> (1956) and Merlau-Ponty's <em>The Visible and the Invisible</em> (1964).&nbsp; Foucault e.g. also said in <em>The Order of Things</em> that ""if the disvoery of the Return is indeed the end of philosophy, then the end of man, for its part, is the return of the beginning of philosophy."" (279)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* While this is the context that provides the ""grist for the mill"" M says, the mill material came from postmodern avante-garde art.&nbsp; He says that D was really into Mallarme, Artaud, Bataille, Solers.&nbsp; And later Ponge.&nbsp; These writers, eh said, are all alike in that ""[i]nstead of attempting to create the illusion of an exxternal world, as writers in a more realist tradition do, these figures engage in a species of textual play..."" (280) He has a quote from Derrida explaining his interest in such works on 280.</p>
<p>* Megill reads Derrida's interest in literature from which the ""mill"" comes from through the novelist Maurice Blanchot who had a distinction between <em>parole brute </em>and <em>parole essentielle</em>.&nbsp; The first is language that is concerned with the reality of things.&nbsp; It ""represents"" and attempt to ""give us things in their presence."" (281)&nbsp; It is language functioning as&nbsp; an ""instrument in a world full of instruments; it connections us with the life of the world and with the ends governing that life."" (281) Here language is attempting to ""efface itseklf as language and to become pure representation..."" (281)&nbsp; Parole essentielle has the opposite effect it ""dsistnces us from things, making them dissapear."" (281)&nbsp; Here language does not efface itself but instead seeks to ""impose itself--though in impoosing itself it imposes nothing outside itself."" (281)&nbsp; It is the language of th epoet and it is langauge being used as itself an essential thing.&nbsp; The language becomes an end in itself. (281)</p>
<p>* Now he comes to what is postmodern...It can be seen he thinks in Blanchot's distinction.&nbsp; Blanchot he says is ""reproducing the sense of crisis or division that is fundmaental to both modernism and postmodernism.""&nbsp; (282) But he says the difference is that Blanchot and teh postmodern does not seek tio ""countenance the reconstituting of truth on the level of literature."" -- whereas the modernist would.&nbsp; Using Alan Wilde, he says, there's a lack of an ""anironic"" impulse in the postmodern thinker that is central to the modernist: ""the impulse to create an appearance of order to counterbalance ahotic reality..."" (282)&nbsp; This he says dissapears in postmodernism.&nbsp; What Blanchot is ddoing is imagining the ""impersonality"" of art, Megill says.&nbsp; Something like Heidegger whose idea ""die Sprache Spricht""--that it is not man but language that speaks--moves in the same direction, only with a greater degree of nostalgia for the ""world of ancient Greece as a refuge again st the ironic, unhoming, fragmeniting character of modern technology...""&nbsp; (282)&nbsp; Whereas in Blanchot there is nothing anironic Megill insists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Megill notes that he does tnot know what influence Blanchot had on D, but he does think that there's an affinity and that's waht counts.&nbsp; They are both open to what Megill has defined as the postmodern in literature.&nbsp; Can be seen as his lack of anironic impulse, his interest in paraody, his preference for postmodern artists, but also in the ""literary"" or ""artistic"" nature of his philosophical enterprise.&nbsp; What Derrida does that is typical of the postmodernis that he will ""reject what modernist instellectual still accept--namely, the notion of science as a haven or a refuge, as an ironic protection (however uncertain) against the irony of existence..."" (282)&nbsp; Ie D like postmodernists no longer can ""take seriously the distinction between scientific discourse and non-scientific discourse, or between critisim and art."" (282)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* So in Blanchot's case Megill says that his criticism is not ""radically divergent"" from his fictions or vice versa.&nbsp; Same with Derrida he insists.&nbsp; Especially evident in his work <em>Glas</em>, where he deals withHegel and Jean Genet!!&nbsp; Here Megill says he basically is creating a kind of ""literary-philosophical <em>collage</em>."" (283)&nbsp; Megill says the link between Blanchot and Derrida are especially clearin his essay ""The Double Session"" about Mallarme's ""mimicry"".&nbsp; The idea is that mime language goes outside the Western ""logocentric"" tradition.&nbsp; Miming does not try to represent reality but it ""produces mere 'reality-effects'..."" (183)&nbsp; Or ""the refereant is lifted, but reference remains; what is left is only the writing of dreams, a fiction that is not imaginary, mimicry without imitation, without verisimilitude, without truth or falsity...There remain only traces, foretelling, recallings, fore-blows and after-blows which no present will hav preceded or followed and which cannot be arranged on a line."" (283)&nbsp; [Good stuff potentially re the breakdown in shape or repatterning of history...]&nbsp; So Megill says that Derrida is describing a ""literature of crisis"" that ""marks out an absolute alienation from the extant world by refusing in any way to repreat, to 're-present it'.&nbsp; This is why imitation, verisimilitude, truth, and falsity are all excluded."" (284)&nbsp; This kidn of literature is then ""supremely ironical"" and not only in the sense of ""saying one thing and meaning another"" but more deeply ""in the heightened sense of saying one thing and meaning, or 'wishing to say,' nothing at all.""&nbsp; This leads inevitably to parody as a resource.&nbsp; (284)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* So then what does this mean about writing, what is the larger point of this ""literary crisis.""&nbsp; Or waht is this literary crisis?&nbsp; Megill says that to the extent that Derrida dervies a thesis it is that in the west writing was dismissed for speech, where speech is much more like Blanchot's <em>parole brutal</em>.&nbsp; ""Speech stands for immediaacy--or more precisely for intelligibility, for the possibility of contact with Truth, with the 'trascendental signified.'"" (285)&nbsp; So in <em>Of Grammatalogy</em>, D writes: ""writing, the sensible inscription, has always been considered by Western tradition as the body and matter external to the spirit, to breath, to speech, and to the logos."" (quoted on 285)&nbsp; By condemning this, Derrida is seeking to condemt the ""Western tradition for its commitment to the ultimate possibility of literal truth."" (286)&nbsp; Derrida tracks this preference for speech over writing to Socrates attack on writing near the end of the dialogue in Plato's <em>Phaedrus</em>.&nbsp; ""Writing, Socrates here maintains, is only an image of living speech; speech is far prefarable to it.&nbsp; Writing weakens the memory.&nbsp; Writings get out of hand of the writer and come to be misinterpreted.&nbsp; Writings hsould serve only as a reminder to the reader o fturths that he already understands."" (286)&nbsp; Blanchot also had noticed this attack on writing whereas most critics pass over it.&nbsp; Blanchot thinks that Socrates is diusmayed&nbsp; by the silence of art and draws this out in some writing on Rene Char, the poet.&nbsp; (see 287-288) .&nbsp; Heidegger's view--die Sprache Spricht--that Megill has said D also picks up on (thought without the nostalgia) is a way to note how language speaks without the author.&nbsp; (287-288) What Socrates is attacking is the ""impersonality of art"" -- its independence along with language from the author -- that is important for Blanchot.&nbsp; Against this idea that speech can get at something that is simply true--that the author knows indepdently of language, that the language is amere vehicle--Blanchot like Heidegger sees in art a kind of not a simple expression of an independent truth, but a way of ""indicating"".&nbsp; Blanchot quotes Heraclitus: ""The Lord whose oracle is at Delphia neiter expresses nor conceals but indicates.""&nbsp; And this Megill thinks is what Blanchot and Heidegger see in art, he quotes again: ""saying nothing, hiding nothing, openinga&nbsp; space, opening it to whoever opens himself to its access."" (Blanchot? quoted on 288).&nbsp;</p>
<p>* But what does alll this add up to?&nbsp; It's an anti-ontological position.&nbsp; Megill quotes him amazingly as reimagining Plato's cave totally reconfigured in an anti-ontological way such that: ""Imagine that the mirrors would not be <em>in </em>the wrold, simply, incluied in the totality of all <em>onta</em> and their images, but that things 'present,'&nbsp; on the contrary, would be in <em>them</em>.&nbsp; Imagine that mirrors (shadows, reflections, phantasms, etc.) would no longer be <em>comprehended</em> within the structure of the ontology and myth of the cave...but would rather envelop it in its entirey, porudinc here or there a particular, extremely determinate effect.&nbsp; The whole hierarchy described in the <em>Republic</em>, in its cave and in its line, would once again find itself at stake and in question in the theater of <em>Numbers</em>."" (quoted on 289)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Megill says that for English readers the French names that Derrida sees as expliyfing an anti-ontological stance won't be significance ecept Mallarme, but he sees a link in Duchamp's urinal, in Magritte's ""puning paintings and drawings"" and in the James Joyce of <em>Finnegan's Wake, </em>and not in the Joyce of <em>Ulysses.&nbsp; </em>Because in <em>Ulysses</em> Joyce was interested in ""restoring art to 'its contenxt in expereince'..."" (289)&nbsp; Megill thinks in that novel you can read that Joyce wanted to challenge concepts like ""naturalness and literatlity""... (289)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Megill thinks the conflict can be understood in part as a conflict between hermeneutics and epistemology as Rorty distinguishes them.&nbsp; Here&nbsp; Rorty defines epistemology as the ideal that we understand perfectly what is happening.&nbsp; By contrast, hermeneutics is when we don't understand what is happening and can admit that.&nbsp; (289)&nbsp; <strong>Megill says that crisis is wound up with this notion of hermeneutics because ""in crisis we do not understand what is happening: we sense a turning but do not know where the turning will end."" (290)&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>* Now Megill get's deeper into the implications for crisis--ie Derrida's decontruction of it.&nbsp; It begins with the paradox that the ""heremeneut"" says there's nothing outside the text, and then he also justifies the hermeneutic enterprise ""on the grounds that we are in crisis.""&nbsp; (290)&nbsp; Derrida highlights this problem because he forces us to ask ""What becomes of the crisis when he [Derrida] denies that we can possibly know that such a thing as a crisis can take place outside the confines of the text?"" (291)&nbsp; Megill insists that D is aware of the paradox and he deals with its by writing ""as if"" literature had entered into a crisis and then ""to work out the implications of such a crisis."" (291) But it's not totally clear that he thinks such a crisis actually exists.</p>
<p>* But if it does, it's not just a ""literary crisis.""&nbsp; Literary crisis is just a subset of a broad crisis in the Western tradition.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Literatary criticism has just been a ""stalking horse"" in D's mind for the comm itment to ""presence.""--ie the idea that things exists in their reality and can be known and stated through ""speech.""&nbsp; Megill explains that D thinks that literary criticism has simply ""treated literature under the category of 'presence', thus subjecting it to 'Western philosophy'"" (291)&nbsp; It has then repressed thsoe parts of literature that dont' ""accord with presentist, memtological, intological, metaphysical assumptions."" (292)&nbsp; It does this by seeking to ""determine a mean ing through a text, to pronounce a decision upon it, to decide that this or taht <em>is </em>a meaning and that it is meaningful, to say that this meaning is posed, posable, or trnaspoableas such: a theme"".&nbsp; (quoted on 292)&nbsp; So then if there's a crisis in literature vv presence, there is then also a crisis in the Western tradition.&nbsp; Megill quotes extensively to illustrate wthat that crisis would be on 292-294.&nbsp; It's an ""exhaustion"" or ""closure"" of this Western enthusiasm for ""logocentric metaphysics.""&nbsp; (293)&nbsp; D sees this in what he calls on quote on 293 the ""death of the book"" or a ""death of speech"" or ""full speech"" and a ""new mutation in the history of writing, in history as writing."" (293)&nbsp; Megill points otu that one could see a parallel to Foucault's crisis calls at the End of the <em>Order of Thigns</em> when ""the death of the modern <em>episteme</em> is gleefuly proclaimed."" (293)&nbsp; But there's no similar forcce or apocalypticism in Derrida.&nbsp; Megill suggest there is instead a kind of paraody of ""crisis thought itself"" -- ie not a parody of Cartesian thought, but of crisis thought, of the kind of thinking begun by Nietzsche and completed in Foucault. ""It is this kind of confident apocalypticism--invented by Nietzsche and run into teh ground by Foucault--that Drrida makes fun of."" (294)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* <strong>Key moment in Megill's argument</strong>: If we take Nietzsche, Foucault, and H as crisis thinkers.&nbsp; And there are others he ntoes!!&nbsp; (see 294)&nbsp; Here he wants to make his point that these notiosn of crisis ""coexist with a deep interset in history...""&nbsp; (295) IE their claims of crisis depend upon a notion of historicism as as directional historical development.&nbsp; (295-296) So then ""Nineeenth-century historicism gave way to the twentieth-cnetury crisis commitment."" (296) And the latter depends on the former.&nbsp; He lays out this idea in a bit more detail 295-296.</p>
<p>* Buyt in Derrida ""the thought of crisis finally undermines itself, for Derrida turns his critical attention to the whole notion of history as linear...."" (297) In his deconstruction of Foucault's <em>History of Madness</em>, D critiques F for implicitly involving a notion of an ""original presence"" -- in much the same way that Megill is saying that the notion of crisis presumes the existince of historicism.&nbsp; (297)&nbsp; And in <em>Of Grammatology</em>, Megill says it is ""precisely the notion of history as an ordered line of poresents--history with a capital H--that Derrida criticizes..."" (297)&nbsp; And he writes: ""the word <em>history</em> has no doubt always been associated with a linear scheme of the unfolding of the presence, where the line relates the final presence to teh originary presence accrding to the straight line or the circle."" (quoted on 297-8)&nbsp; Megill thinsk that this is sort of pronvincial because hsitory has not always been thought of that way, but in the ""porphecy of extremity and in historicism"" it has been so he says.&nbsp; And Derrida is exposing the interdependence of historicism and crisis.&nbsp; So Megill thinks he sees through this problem in the crisis thinkers. ""Seeing through the myth of the tradition, he undermines the crisis view.&nbsp; The knell of hsitoricism is also the knell of crisis."" (298)</p>
<p>* The last gesture of the cahpter is that in Nietzsche, Foucualt, and Heidegger there was already a kind of view that gets at a kind of relationshp to history in which there's no burden of history felt.&nbsp; Where the various moments just exist in no sequential order. Things have bee cast free so to speak.&nbsp; And he says in thsi sense Derrida was just making expklicit a view that existed in inchoate form in the tought of the others. (298)&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ch. 8&nbsp; The Deconstruction of Art</strong></p>
<p>(taking fewer notes here for the sake of time)</p>
<p>* As the ttile indicates, he's dealing with Derrida's deconstruction of art here.&nbsp; He states at the outset the D is more directly concerned with aesthetics and with artists than the others.&nbsp; (299)</p>
<p>* He reflects on misreadings of D's strong aestheticism and his use of different writing styles... ..a tendency to compartmentalize his works.&nbsp; (300-301)&nbsp; He reiterates that he think to be consistent with D's idea this can't be done because for D there was not such thing as a purely ""sscholarly, political, or aesthetic problem..."" and that conclusion is a resutl of his ""own attempts to undermine the Kantian distinction between the theoretical, the practical, and the aesthetic."" (302)</p>
<p>* He rejects the idea that D's goal was to remove ""pathos"" from literature.&nbsp; He sees pathos in D's works (not in comparison in Paul De Man's).&nbsp; (303)</p>
<p>* D's radical irony he says is dependent on the ""historical existence of a tradition that lends it pathos"" and which is ""intertwined with that of the logocentric, phonocentric West, to such an extent that the two now seem almost inseparable."" (303)&nbsp; He means Judaism!</p>
<p>* This is a complex thing to say.&nbsp; First step, is that he thinks it is ""clear that Derrida writes in the shadow of the Holocaust."" (303)&nbsp; Though it is never present in a ""vulgar"" way.&nbsp; He insists&nbsp; that ""Derrida's appeal to Judaism as a marginal tradition, present wtihin the interstices and along the edges of the 'Western' tradtion, gives to his writing a&nbsp; much greater sense of alienation from that tradition that one finds in Nietzsche and Heidegger. If ""his predecessors can appeal to the pre-Socratics and sophists, Derrida cannot--for these, too, are part of the tradition that he wishes to attack."" (303-304)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>* In raising this issue, Megill says he's dealing with a huge and complex problem that is hard to deal with. (304)&nbsp; But he insists it is the ""hidden center and motivation for other issues that might at first glance seem to be entirely unrelated to it...""&nbsp; (304)&nbsp; He list four issues: the question of the ""other"", esp vv Emannuel Livanas; the question of 'writing' or secondariness, vv Edmond Jabes; third, the question of ""interpretation, vv Freud, and fourthe the question of ""art,"" vv Kant.&nbsp; (304)&nbsp; He sumes up these issues on 304-305.&nbsp;</p>
<p>*&nbsp; In the section ""Levinas and the pursuit of the 'other'"",&nbsp; Levinas has a critique of German romantics and Husserl interest in unity as a philosphy interested in the ""same"" -- a discourse ultimately about power and exclusion.&nbsp; Derrida undermines this a bit, imagining that wheresa Levinas sees the interest in the same as a desire to remove the Jewish <em>alter ego</em>, Derrida ""maintains that 'the themes of nonpresence' work over phenomenology unceasingly,..."" (310)&nbsp; ... ie the problem of the other, of its infinite alterity, is always present.&nbsp; He's trying, Megill thinks, to deconstruct Levina's ""conception of a Hebraism that would stand in opposition to Western philsophy.""&nbsp; (310)&nbsp; He's removing the possiblity for thinking of a ""pristine Judasim"".&nbsp; (311)&nbsp; and wants instead to think o fthe ""inevitable complicity of Judasim with the totality it seeks to oppose.""&nbsp; (311)&nbsp; So he's trying to erase the powerful ""distinction between Hebraism and Hellenism"" that appears often,&nbsp; BUT it remains in his thought.&nbsp; His erasure is a mere concealment, not an absence Megill says.&nbsp; He qutoes a fascination quote where D talking about Levinas, imagines Levinas to be suggesting that there be a second patricide, of the Greek father who is still dominant, and then by asking the question ""will a non-Greek ever succed in doing what&nbsp; Greek in this case could nto do, except by digusuing himself as Greek, be <em>speaking Greek, </em>by feigning to speak Greek in order to get near the king?"" (quoted on 311)&nbsp; Megill thus speculates that D was engaged in a project of dehellinization even after his critique of Levinas.&nbsp; He writes Harold Bloom has suggest this e.g. as well that ""Derrida substiutes the Hebrew <em>davhar</em>, with its connection to the act and marks of writing, for the ethereal Greek logos."" (312)&nbsp; Also G. Douglis Atkins, is clear on the ""Hebraic"" elements in Derrida.&nbsp; Atkins sees D as ""engaged in a sysetmatic project of dehellinization, an attack on the values of clarity, transparency, and intellecutal maastery that are so deeply imbedded within Western consciousness.""

Getting Spliced: Modernism and Sexual Difference,"p.111-116 Moore analysis...

Burke analyzes Moore here.  Elliot, Pound and William Carlos Williams saw these women as the most intelligent.  They fed into their competition.  She shows how Moore, who was a bit jealous of Loy's sophistication, subjects that sophistication to inspection, and then that also enters into her poem ""Marriage"" ... which critiques marraige, revealing the problem of sex difference, the problem of union that is built upon others coming together -- which Burke says is ""perhaps the central 'contrarity' for a poects based on what Kenneth Burke calls 'the motif of the spinster...and the tehme of the spirited feminie indepdneence'"" (114) -- and also the implicit male power in marriage -- Moore writes that she is not so interested in an marraige, which she calls an enterprise, that ""works according to the principle of 'that which is great because something else is small.'"" (115).  

Burke concludes the section with Williams' insight that Moore disliked ""connectives."" Burke writes: ""Her dislike of connectives keeps all the partners in the verbal dance at a discrete (and discreet) distance from each other--'unnicked'--while the intelligence moves them about in new choreographies, without, however, resolving their figures back into the two-steps of social dancing.""

Beyond Separate Spheres: Intellectual Roots of Modern Feminism,"<p>p.170-  Parsons leaves behind evolutionism  Parsons left behind evolutionism.  She then became accoridng  somebody a de facto functionalist before functionalism was present.  (171)  Perhaps because she saw the origins of human behavior as unconscious Rosenberg thinks this is apt.  (171)   So then she wanted to know why certain habits and customs held:.  She never answered definitely.  One asnwer was the sense that people needed to sheild themselves from difference.  (171)  Men saw women as anomalous, so men's fear of women was a fear of difference. (171-172).    So she thought a woman takes up a man's arm in order also to ""raise up an imperceptible kind of barrier between us, a barrier converlty soothig to the snese of disquiet, extremely slight in this circumstance of course, the difference in sex arouses.  As a gesture of sex, taking a man's arm is a kind of innoculation agianst sex."" (quoted on 172).   So fear central, fear of declassificaiton, men don't want to desexualize women; women don't want to be desexualized.  (172).  But it wasn't just fear, their was also a ""will to power"" : thus classification served the function of ""social rule."" (173) as she wrote in her book Social Rule.

Multiculturalism: Examining the Politics of Recognition,"<p>Notes on Taylor's Essay</p>
<p>Notes on Taylor on Multiculturalism<br /><br />* T starts by saying that much of contemporary politics turns on ""the need, sometimes the demand for recognition."" (25) Recognition underlies nationalist movements, in he claims of he subaltern, in some forms of feminism, and in multiculturalism.<br /><br />* The demand for recognition he says is given ""urgency"" by the ""supposed links between recognition and identity, where this latter term designates something like a person's understanding of who they are, of their fundamental charachteristics as a human being."" (25) Recognition is important because if a person is not recognized or falsely recognized and represeented he idea is that this can cause harm and is a form of oppression that imprisons a person or a people in a ""false, distorted, ans reduced mode if being."" (25) e.g. feminists have argued that women have internalized a social representation of their own inferiority. A similar afgument has been allied to he subjects of European colonization. <br /><br />* Taylor wants to give he historical origins of this politics of recognition and identity. Bevelled was the first to develop the notion of recognition in his famous dialectic if the master and slave. But there is an earlier narrative origin in T's account. He roots it in the collapse of social hierarchy and the notion of honor, which presumed inequality. What replaced honor was the ""modern notion of dignity."" (27) The idea here he says was that everyone shares in dignity and this introduced the principle of equal recognition, which has been central to democratic societies. But what ultimately modified and ""intensified"" the principle of recognition was the new notion of individual identity that emerged at the end if the 18th century along with a notion of being true to oneself that Taylor calls ""authenticity"" following Trilling's study ""Sincerity and Authenticity."" (28). He gives a god and brief account of the rise of this ideal on 28 and 29. Basically, it originates in the late 18th century idea that humans have a moral source inside themselves. Whereas before being a full humans being meant being in touch with an external moral source, now that source is ""deep within us."" (29). So T says this is part of the ""massive subjective turn of modern culture, a new form of unsafeness, in which we come to think of ourselves as beings with inner depths."" (29). Rousseau was crucial in developing this idea. (29-30). But the notion of authenticity developed as the result ifbwhat Taylor calls a ""displacement of the moral accent"" in the idea hat we had a moral source within us. The original idea included the idea that it was important to be untouched with one's ""moral feelings"" in order to know what is right to do. The displacement he is talking about ""comes about when bejng in touch with our feelings takes in crucial moral significance."" (28). This shift takes place after Rousseau and T associates it with Herder, who he says ""put forward the idea that each of us has an original way of being human: each person has his or her own 'measure.'"" (30) This idea he says has ""burrowed"" deep into modern consciousness and it is quite new because nobody before would have assigned such moral importance to the differences between humans."" (30). Herder applied this principle both to individuals and to groups, ie the Germans should not pretend to be French. <br /><br />* Once the idea of authenticity is in place in relation to individual identity, however, it became tied to the principle of recognition. It's not clear from T's analysis how orbit Herder dealt with recognition, although he says it first came up in Hegel. But what he does is pointbout mentikningbGeorge Herbert Mead that our ""identities"" cannog be purely ""monologically"" developed inwardly. That is because human life has a ""fundamentally dialogical charachter."" Our identities are developed through the acquisition of languages--in a broad sense including expressions and gestures--and through exchange with what Mead called ""significant others."" (32). So one's identity is not worked out in isolation. T thinks this has always been true. Such sependence in others did not rise with the importance of authenticity. It was always there in the social categories that everyone took for granted. What happened in modem times wwas the possibility that recognition could fail. So in premodern times ""people didn't speak if ""identity"" and recognition--not because people didn't have (what we call) identities, or because these didn't depend on recognition, but rather because these were then too unproblematic to be thematized as such."" (35) <br /><br />* The result of the rise of a politics of recognition has been the development of a discourse of identity formation in the ""intimate sphere"" where we understand the formation of the self to be taking place ""in a continuing dialogue and struggle with significant others."" (37).&nbsp; Because the individual needs and is vulnerable to significant others in this culture of authenticity relationships of all sorts but especially love relationships took on greater importance. (36)&nbsp; This is the realm that Ibwas describing in my last dissertation chapter. Then the politics of recognition is also felt in the realm of the public sphere where its role has taken on more importance. He points out that in this social sphere the idea that identities aee dialogically formed has ""made the politics of recognition more.central.and stressful."" (36). And even more it has raised the stakes because the refusal of recognition it is understood can cause harm. (36) Taylor wants to focus on the latter in the- analysis that follows. (37). He indicates he links between the two levels are numerous...but ions strand has emerged outvoted psychologically oriented feminism. He points to Nancy Chodrow's Feminism and Psychoanalytic Theory and also Jessica Benjamin's Bonds of Love .<br /><br />* What happened in public sphere: move from honor to dignity created a politics of universalism that- militated against privilege. Then the notions of authenticity and identity created a ""politics of difference"" in which we are supposed to recognize the individual or group's distinctness. The universalism of the original.universalism is now seen asnoriblematic precisely because it villolates that distinctness and forces assimilation or conformity to the dominant majority identity. (38). He notes an example of this charge from a feminist perspective in Carol Gilligan's critique of Kohlberg's Beirut of mtoral.development in In a Different Voice. Underlying thisbpolitics of difference is a universalism. It too opposes privilege but the demands of universalism are limited sharply by the demands of the politics of difference: ""we give due acknowledgment only to what is universally present--everyone has an identity--thriuh recognizing what is peculiar to each. The universal demand powers an acknowledgement of specificity."" (39) <br /><br />* Another consequence was that the politics if difference generated an aawareness if a new kind of secknd class citizenship, ie not a kind as before conditioned by poverty but instead by lack of recognition of difference. (39). His led to new prrograms such as affirmative action that seemed to be ""undue favoritism "" for those who he says had ""nit gone along"" with the way the politics if difference altered the nilotion of equality. (39) ie for those who stick to the original notion of dignity programs destined tobpreserve and protect some cultural heritage ""seem like a reversal, a betrayal, a simple negation of their cherished principle."" (40) <br /><br />* The point here then is that the politics if universal dignity and the politics of difference begin to diverge even though they both originate in the original shift to dignit</p>"
"From Experts to Social Scientists: The American Anthropologists, 1929-1963","p.022 -26    Intellectual ""Structure"" in early 30s

Madden's theme resurfaces ""Anthropology as a body of knowledge was not entirely secure inthe early 1930s... "" (22) 

Now he traces a break in linguistics and anthropology, rooted in a difference between Sapir and Leonard Bloomfield's theory emerged in his 1933 book on <i>Language</i>.  The difference had to do with the degree to which linguistis were allowed to deal with ""meaning"" as opposed to structure and syntax.  Bloomfield's thoeries left less meaning for an examination of meaning, and that his shoudl be left to anthropologists and psychologists.  This turn led eventually to chomsky's <i>Syntactic Structures</i> in the 50s.  (22-24).  

Another problem M identifies is lack of centralization in terms of the different cultures of anth. knowledge developing at different universiteis where anthropology maintianed relaitons with different depts.  This lack of uniformity Madden however suggests was not fragmenting partly b/c most anthropologists ""remained eclectic"" and ""did not use these different approaches to promote models, 'schools of thought,' or paradigms..."" (24), i.e. they were ""pre-paradigmatic"" as he argues in the intro. (24)

Chicago: 
Close intellectual ties with sociology among anthropologists at Chiacgo despite break.  Redffield trained under Robert Park and married his daughter.  (24)  Radcliffe-Brown came to Chiacgo in 1931 and imported British structuralist anth., a theory based heavily on Durkheim's notions of social organizaiton.  R-B stayed at Chicago until 1937 influence Redfield and Fred Eggan.  1934 R-B chairman of Diviosn of the Social Sciences aat Chicago.  1935 he hires another ""structuralist anthropologist"": William LloydWarner, trained by Lowie and Kroeber at Berkeley, but who came under R-B's influence while doing fieldwork in Australia. (25)      Madden argues that R-B's appraoch was ""pardigmatic in that [he]d defined a single research agenda and emphasized particular kinds of data at the expense of others."" (25)   But R-B's ideas did not have power.  Madden says anthropolosts did not want to abandon ""holistic notions of culture"" or more gneerally ""diachronic"" forms of analysis (25-26) 

Columbia:
Was forming closer ties with psychology.  ""In 1929, the anthropology department at Columbia had moved from the Journalism Building to the fourth floor of Skermerhorn Extension and shared a wing with the psychology department.  Students of both disciplines shared a common reading room."" (26)"

'The Value of Person Lies in His Herzensbildung': Franz Boas' Baffin Island Letter-Diary 1883-1884,"<p>&nbsp;Notes 7/9/2012</p>
<p>Ok...glancing at this article now for two reasons. 1) How does it support the whole conversion-fieldwork motif that is told vv Boas, and subsequently becomes key for anthropology, as Julia Liss states it at the outset of her ""Patterns of Strangeness.""? 2) Is there any thing in the reproduction of the thing that I can use for my claims vv Kant and Boas?</p>
<p>Number 1 is easy:</p>
<p>"" This isn't an article so much as a reproduction/ translation of parts of the letter-diary that Boas kept. Cole gives a useful description of the circumstances in which Boas wrote it: namely, that it was in many ways an extended love letter to Marie, who he had recently become engaged to, and also a kind of field-journal.</p>
<p>"" Cole also describes what Boas intended to do in the Arctic. Boas had finished a dissertation in 1881 from Kiel in physics, but had begun to move in the direction of geography, which up until then he'd studied as a minor field. (13) By April 1882, when he was doing his military service, he was already planning, in his words, ""an investigation of the dependence of contemporyr Eskimo migrations upon the physical relationships and forms of their land. (BPP: FB/A. Jacobi 4/10/82: cf. Kluckhohn &amp; Prufer 1959, Stocking 1968).""</p>
<p>* He chose the Eskimo or Inuit, Cole think, partly because it was not overstudied. And maybe because as early as 1870 he had told his sister Toni of his desire to take an expedition to the north or south pole. See BPP: FB to Toni 12/3/70).&nbsp; (14)</p>
<p>* His goal in research had to do with his reading and contribution to the geographical literature on the Arctic in the year he spent preparing to go to the arctic in Berlin. He wrote an article on the ""homeland of the Netsilik Eskimo"" in which he described and ""postulated extensive routes of trade and travel between Inuit groups of the central an eastern Arctic.&nbsp; Accoridng to the article, these well-established routets extended from Ugulik, a settlement at the western tip of King William Island, eastward through Iglulik on Fury and Hecla Strait, and from there in two direction on Baffin island--to Pond Inlet at the northern end, and down along the western coast, connecting eastwards to Cumberland Sound."" (15) Cole says that these ""interests and postulates"" structured his plan for investigation in Cumberland ound.&nbsp; He was to do cartographic and meteorological research, but also to student ""Eskimo migration, hunting areas, trade routes, and the realtionships of one group to another."" (15)&nbsp; Cole describes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>he would travel in the summer and fall of 1883 to Lake Kennedy (Lake Nettilling), an island sheet of fresh water, and from there attempt to reach the west coast of Baffin Island and follow it north to Iglulik. Returning to winter in Cumberland Sound, he would 'collect ethnographic material and make a thorough study of the language, customs and habigts of the Esktiomo' (BFP: 'Als Ausgangspunkt' n.d.) In the spring he would return to Ilulik and then, by the route postuated in his article, travel north to Pond Inlet, perhaps yet farther north to Devon Island. He would return to Cumbelrand Sound in July along the Davis Strait, and ail home in the fall aboard a whaler. (15)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that Cole is quoting that he would collect ethnographic data. This I think is the subtle way in which the emphasis comes to rest on ethnographic research into cultures? Or is this too strong an accustation of Cole's intentions?</p>
<p>* Cole also notes that Boas hoped tht the trip would end with him being pciked up by an ""American whaler."" So that he could go to NY and see Marie Krackowiyer, the daughter of Dr. Ernst Krackowiyer, an austrian 1848er and friend of Abraham Jacob, Boas uncle (by marriage). (15) Cole describes how that relationship developed 15-16.&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Now skipping to the end, Cole says that the trip was mostly a failure in terms of Boas' original intentions. (49) And then the key argument: ""Retrospectively, of course, the most significant aspect of Boas' experience in Baffin Island was his ethnographic immersion among the Inuit. His life and reputation were to be made in anthropology, and this was his initiation."" Cole means initiation into ethnography. The idea of initiation is what Liss is talking about in her ""Patterns of Strangeness."" Cole also then says that Boas at this point began to ""see the tasks of ethnography as 'more pressing'."" Here he is quoting Boas from FB/Bell 3/19/86)</p>
<p>* The repulsion that Boas felt for the Eskimo at first he emphasized in his first three <em>Tageblatt </em>articles, which dealt with his initial impressions of the Eskimo. Cole quoteson the disgust fromDie Eskmos des Cumberland-Sundes und der Davisstrasse <em>Berliner Tageblatt, </em>Nov.2. 1884:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Had someone then told me that in a short time I would be living without resistance in the same conditions, I would have denied such impuatation with indignation. It was not long, however, before the force of circumstances had brought me to share the native caribou-hide dwelling and cook in the same kettle--though I usuall took the precaustion of having my own kettle... (quoted on 21)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This quote does seem to confirm in a way some of what I am saying in my article. The way he notes the transition from a reistance to a certain form of living, and then a gettin gused to it. A habitual acquiescence or something. He takes to the new way of being in other words...</p>
<p>* Boas also notes, interestingly, that he is able to get on with the Eskimo mostly because they all speak English!! He writes: ""I have found such a kind and friendly welcome here that I feel quite at home. I get along well in English and most of the Eskimo understand and talk English."" (22)</p>
<p>* On Sept. 24in Kikkerton, he writes to Marie (he is able to write to her) that he will stay in the viccinity of Kikkerton until Christmas, and then he will travel with the Eskimo in Januar when they ""against start to travel."" (22)</p>
<p>* He has met a Mr. Mutch who promises to help him, who seems not to be German.&nbsp; He was a servant of a Mr. Noble,,.&nbsp; He will take im to an Eskimo whom he knows at the sea, and the Eskimo man can take him further... (22-23)</p>
<p>* Next Boas took a strip on Sept. 25th to an ""oil cache"" on Warham Island. They got stuck and he wasn't able to return to Kikerton until October 4th. Then Boas traveled with on ""Signa's whaler"". Then he travels with Wilhelm (his servant from home, Signa, Utjutjak, who Cole says is called Yankee and is a nephew of Signa, along the ""length of Pangnirtung Fjord."" (23)</p>
<p>* A good example of this sense of wanting to take something sacred. On October 11th, he writes: ""...At noon we stopped to rest on a plant-covered terrace and while dinner was being cooked, I climbed up and found three old well-preserved skulls, but I did not dare on account fo the Eskimo, whom I would have greatly offended. So I had to row on without aying anything abut my discovery..."" (23)</p>
<p>* Around October 22, Boas was confined to Kikkerton because ice began to form on the Sound. And he couldn't go until early December when the ice was strong enough to bear a sled. He thus set up a tent ont he ice, Cole says, to ""measure the tides"" and chart the islands and its surroundings. He also got help from Mr. Mutch to study the Inuit, focusing in aprticualr on their ""geogrpahical knowledge."" Cole says. (24) Cole quotes from an 1884 article ""A journey in Cumberland Sound and on the West Short of Davis Strait in 1883 and 1884"" printed in the Am. Geog Society, N.Y.. Bulleting, 16, 242-72:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every night I spent with the natives whole told me about the configuration of the land, about their travels, etc. They related the old stoories handed over to them by their ancestors, sang the old songs after the old monotonous tunes, and I saw them playing the old games, with which they shorten th elong, dark winter nights... (quoted on 24)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>* He reports that he is called upon as a ""doctor"" and they call him Doctoradluk [I couldn't copy the special characters].&nbsp; So he is taking care of these people's dieing kids or people with pneumonia and he feels a sense of responsibility because he cannot do anything. (24-25) He reports thi to Marie on November 18, Kikkerton, an says he's writing her for solace for his heavy heart.</p>
<p>* He reports on Nov.25, still in Kikkerton that life is ""rought: ""Marie, truly it is a rought life her among the Eskimo. I oftne painfully miss the voice of a friend, but you help me bear all this and I shalll return to you as I left..."" (25)</p>
<p>* Then on Dec 2, Kikkerton he reports being happier. He talks about how he plays often with the children. ""Usually we sing together and play, whereby I always have the secret intention of learning their games."" Then he says how it is good there.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>""I wish you could see me among the Eskimo. It is not nearly as bad as you imagine. I am as comfortable warm in my fur clothes&nbsp; as I could wish to be. I took a two-hour walk today only for pleaure and in spite of the wind and [-23 C] cold I was as&nbsp; warm as in the house. I will be happy when I can show you photographs of all the places where I have been! I go about Kikkerton in order to take them an in the evening I have important conversations with the Eskimo about customs, songs, religion, etc. Mr. Mutch is very helpful as interpreter and gives me a great deal of information about all possible things. Now they are all busy making caribou cltohing and I hope they will be finished this week. Then I can again think of travelling and hop first to go northward. In the next month I ntend to set up a depot of provisions, etc. for Davis Strait and then to go to Lake Kennedy...""</p>
</blockquote>
<p>* KEY KEY: In this quote, Boas says a few things that are juxtaposed. He talks about his belief that happiness ""as a member of humanity as whole"" requires working with ""all one's energy' with the ""masses"". (27):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dec 12, near Nixtung: Dear Marie! I am not two days distant from Kikkerton, at the same place where I was a long time ago in a boat where I met the Eskimo who were returnign from Nittiling. What great differences exist between now and then...Although it is [-35c] col,d I did not feel cold while I walked. My caribou clothing was almost too warm. I almost wen off alone with Signa, because Wilhelmä's clothing was not ready, but Mr. Mutch took pity on me and lent me his things. I hope they will send uus th emissing things next week....Do you know that for a while I believed I had no heart, because I did not take things so much to heart as others idid. But I know better now. You, my Marie, have taught me that I am still able to feel. How happy we will be! But I am wandering from m y excursion to Augpalugtung. (You wrote me once I should not use logic in my letters--don't you do that in this case.) I believe that one can be really happy only as a member of humanity as a whole, if one works with all one's energy together withthe masses towards his goals. I think if one always felt that way it wouldbe much&nbsp; easier to bear hardships and one would be more thankful for every joy. But now good night! I only want ot say once again that I always, always, love you immeasurably, that I long r the moment that shall take me back to you and with longin gI picture the time when nothing shall separate us. And now sleep well, dearest, Dream of your Franz. (28)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interesting here, one the reference to a common humanity, in the context of the masses, which is 1848 politics vv cosmopolitanism? And he's discussing also the idea of feeling with her. Feeling more. He seems to have discovered that he can feel more. Of course, the background of this may be that move away from his materialism that has accompanied his retreat from physics, that other scholars have noted. But feeelng is one the mind...</p>
<p>* Dec. 13th, again t near Nixtang, the weather seems tohave gotten worse. There is a lot of fog. And he is writing something to Marie in a bit difficult circumstances. He seesm to want to communicate how the life is a bit hard. The daily life. He wants to give her a picture of that. He says the iglu is so cole that it hard to write. Then he says it has warmed a bit and he ""still I feel quite comfortable.""&nbsp; Then he says: Feelings of comfort and discomfort are really quite relative."" (28) This discusison of feelings again vv relativity. But a relativity of the preception of them... This is perhaps the kind of relativity in the strong fomr which is what I am maybe arguing againnst in the Manifold origins paper?</p>
<p>* The Kant reference: OOn Dec. 16th, he has had a hard day of travel trying to near American Harbor. Then he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you know how I pass the time these long evenings? I have a copy of Kant with me, which I am stuying, sot hat I shall not be so completly uneducated when I return. Life her really make one dull and stupid (only at times however--whenI et back to Kikkerton I will be sharp again). I have to blush when I remember that during our meal tonigh I though how good a pudding with plum sauce would taste. But you have no idea what an effect privations and hunger, real hunger, have on a person. Maybe Mr. Kant is a good antidote! The contrast is almost unbelievable when I rmember that a year ago I was in societty and observed all the rules of good taste, and tonight I sit in this snow hut with Wilhelm and an Eskimo eatinga piece of raw, fronzen seal meat which had first to be hacked up with an ax, and greedily gulping my coffeee. Is that not as great a contradcition as once can think of ? ... (29)</p>

Cole describes the situation here, indeed the likely possibility that the disease came with the germania and the Catherine. The Eskimo then decide at the behest of a shaman apparently that Boas not be allowed into their igloo. (36) Boas reaction was that this ""hostility"" ought not be ""allowed to prevail"". (36) this reaction is interesting. Clearly, it does involve a kind of arrogant reaction to what Boas could see still as superstitious belief, even though it probably was not. But there is also a more complex background here. One has to think of the fondness Boas had developed for the igloo, for the experience of entering them after being very cold. &nbsp;He says this in the letter from Jan. 22, on 36-37, where the point is in fact that his point of view has shifted in the way that Cole notes oin his editor note on p.21, ie this is the kind of shift in the appreciation of what is beautiful that I am getting at in my Mamifold article.</span><br style=""color: #222222; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;"" /><br style=""color: #222222; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;"" /><span style=""color: #222222; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline ! important; float: none;"">P.37 the quote re igloo's being beautiful, related to Cole's note on 21, form letter Jan. 22: ""You have no idea how anxiously one looks for the appearance of the icefoot on the horizon, and then when one is near to land with joy one greets the sign of an iglu.

With what is here alone it is hard to know exactly what Boas means. He talks about the idea that he would be ""restricted to my science and to teaching"". Does he mean that he would be restricted to physics and teaching? for which he now says he has ""little inclination."" (37) But then he says that in the United States he can further the ""ideas for which I live."" but which ideas? Scientific ideas? Maybe but maybe not beau as a bit further along he says: ""What I want to live and die for, is equal rights for all, equal possibilities to learn and work for poor and rich alike! Don't you believe that to have done even the smallest bit for this, is more than all science together? I do not think I would be allowed to do this in Germany."" (37) So there is no reference here to his being blocked as a Jew. The clearest reference is to a restriction to his science, whatever that means. But perhaps it need not be said to Marie because she knows already, or on the other hand why would he not be free to reference the role of his Jewishness in is calculation with Marie? I need to look in Cole's biography because I think he has a reference from Boas to the Jewishness problem in this calculation....</span><br style=""color: #222222; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;"" /><br style=""color: #222222; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;"" /><span style=""color: #222222; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline ! important; float: none;"">Also interesting here is that he moves on after this to a reference to a harsh reality. He refers romantically tomMarie and how she will help him and give him strength to do all this, an dthen he writes: ""But I must return to harsh reality! The activities of the Eskimo, the howling of e dogs, the screaming of the children, all in this small iglu , call me back."" obviously this is just a transition out of the letter, but the juxtapositions are interesting between a discussion of ideas, even ideals, and love for Marie, and then a reference to. Harsh reality that again does not seem so bad. Chaotic perhaps but it is happening in e small iglu, which he has fought to regain entrance into, and he is ""called"" back, not forced back.</span><br style=""color: #222222; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;"" /><br style=""color: #222222; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;"" /><span style=""color: #222222; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline ! important; float: none;"">Also then at the end of this Another relativity reference. He has referred to the situation in the iglu, then he says he wonders what she is doing, and again the theme from before and discussion of new years activity on 34-35, the theme of her being among her people: ""At least you have the advantage of being able to speak with them [whatever company she is keeping]. I have, however, sometimes found that what one hears in ""society"" is worth [no more for me than] the conversation of these people here."" (37-38) here the second brackets are Cole's.</span></p>
<p>* Letter February 14, Anarnitung. He is trying to go seal hunting, and there are parts of it that are intriguing him. He doesn't succeed in getting anything, but he describes the experience: ""There I sat, like an Eskimo, behind my ice hole at the water's edge and patietnialy waiting for a head to appear. You cannot imainge&nbsp; what an impression it makes in this cold season to sit so near the edge of the water and t hear the roaring and foaming. Thick frog from the cold water envelops me. At my feet the water foams and hisses. Only a strong current keeps the water from freezing here. My resing place shakes and trembles as the pieces of ice strike it.&nbsp; These are finally pulled under by th eforce of the current and I can feel them drifting about under my feet. Suddenly another large piece breaks off and I must retreat quickly in order to to be too close to the water. In a few minutes there is wild chaos where I stood...I shall try my luck again tomorrow. I want to bring back one seal..."" (40)</p>
<p>The next day then he is also not successful. But now he says he is entirely an eskimo: ""Today I unted just as an eskimo, with a pear and all that goes with it. I sat beside the water just as ptiential as they do...""&nbsp; Then a bit farther on: ""As you see Marie, I am now a true Eskimo. I live as they do, hunt with them and belong to the men of Anarnitung. I have hardly any European food left, eat only rseal and drink coffee."" And the a bit farther on: ""Although seal hunging bores me drreadfully I do it as it is the onlyway of obtaining what I need...."" (40) -- that it is the only way for him to get what he needs he probably means is proof also that he IS Eskimo.</p>
<p>* Febrary 16, Anarnitung --&nbsp; Letter is interesting because he describes the scene of the inside of an iglu. He describes it with appreciation, detial, and affectionit seems. But then immediately after he ends that description, with a description of an old man who tells him stories that he seems to like in ""beautiful"" pidgin English, he then goes again into his ""longing"" for people who understand him and with whom he can have ""sensible conversation"". : ""There is one old man named Metik (duck) whom I especially enjoy. As soon as he sees me comeing he calls out 'asshoyoutioli!,' which means 'how are you,' and follows, in the most beautiful pidgein English used by the Eskimo who know English words, with all kinds of stories. Thus I live day after day. Now wonder I long for sensible conversation andf ro someone who really understands me!"" ( 42) Then he describes how he has not brought a book and reads the ads on the Koelnische Zeitung.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* February 18th to March 7th letters, report the ""dog sickness"" -- sickness affecting the sled dogs -- has returned and it's depressing and also I think ruining Boas plans. In the March 7th letter he's talking about wanting to go back in the summer to Marie. He says he feels ""depressed and hopeless"" (44)&nbsp; He says he wants to get courage from her and the like. And he's then getting all wrapped up in masculinity stuff about courage and th elike: ""I must press you to my heart. Oh , I harddly know myself what I am writing. Now you see what has become of my much boasted courage...You see what a weakling your Franz is!"" (44) Of course, this is all likely&nbsp; in part to dramatize his courage and strength in the usual manner of men. He does however seem upset, and then he comes to the followinig conclusion: ""I realize more surely from day to day that I am not meant to live in loneliness. I need people very much, people who really have a right to the name. I feel much better nowt hat I have poured out my heart. .. "" (44) I think the reference to the people who have a right to the name here is n ot the Eskimo--perhaps--but more directly the people on the American shipthat he also refers to in this letter as being horrible. But also in the letter of February 16th, he was getting lonely again and refering to -- after his description of the iglu -- his longing for ""sensible convesration"" as it has been tranlsated. Whatever that means.</p>
<p>* march 19, Ukiadliving: His spirits lighten because he has purchased 10 dogs in Ukiadliving, where he is greeted with cries because he's one of the first Europeans to have gone there. (44-45)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* April 23, He is enjoying the spring weather. (47)</p>
<p>* March 29, Nexemiarbing: He reports that he has heard that American ships had visited Padli the previous summer. So he thinks he may be able to go to America to see Marie. (45)&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Things get bad again. he is affected by snow blindness anda&nbsp; tooth ache among other things. (48-49). Then on July 4 he is partly relieved as Cole says that he meets an Eskimo man doing the last of his work who had travelled to Niaxonaujang from Igluling via Foxe channel to Nettilling. Cole writes: ""This was welcome conrimation of his travel route thesis."" (49)</p>
<p>* On August 26, he hears of two ship. The next day the Wolf, an american ship, arrives and he takes it to St. John's. Then his trip from Newfoundland port on Sept. 7th to NYC is ""frustratingly slow"" Cole says. He arrives finally on teh 21st. And then two days later is ""reunited"" with Marie at Lake George.</p>"
Cosmopolitan Style: Modernism Beyond the Nation,"<p>Notes Feb 2012:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Introduction</strong></p>
<p>* Walkowitz wants to work with a kind of ""critical cosmpolitanism"" that she sees as being distinct from ""planetary humanism"".&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; For planetary humanism she cites Gilroy's Against Race: Imagining Political Culture Beyond the Color Line (2000).&nbsp; She also cites Nussbaum's ""Patriotism and Cosmplitanism?"" and Ross Posnock <em>Color and Culture: Black Writers and the Making of the Modern Intellectual.&nbsp; </em>See f.n. 4., p. 172.&nbsp; By attaching critical to the term she wants to refer to critical theory.&nbsp; And critical in this tradition she thinks ""tends to imply double consciousness, comparison, negation, and persistent self-reflection: an 'unwillingness to rest,' the attempt to operate 'in the world... [while] preserving a posture of resistance,' the entanglement of 'domestic and international perspectives,' and the 'self-reflexive repositioning of the self in the global sphere.'' (2-3)&nbsp; That sentence is cobbled together with quotes from Edward Said, Jacques Lezra, Benjamin Lee and Melba Cuddy-Keane, see f.n. 5, p.172.&nbsp; Then she says that this notion of cosmpolitnaism refers to a type that has been defined by several others, and in f.n. 8 she lists Bruce Robbins's cosmpolitics, Melba Cuddy-Keane's critical globalization, James Clifford's discrepant cosmpoloitanism, and Homi Bhabbha's vernacular cosmopolitanism.&nbsp; (172)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* She tries to explain closely how this fits with critical theory and both supplements and critique's Kant's model on p.3.&nbsp; The two ""gestures of critique"" she wants to pick up on from critical theory are 1 what she calls the distiction between ""traditional"" and ""critical"" theory, and 2 the ""critique of critique"" which sees in her ""modernist"" writers.&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; Critical rather than traditional theory, as Horkheimer defined it, does not see categories as neutral and seeks ""to position knowledge in history, to investigate the social uses of knowledge, and to evaluate political interests that knowledge served."" (3) It does not reject the notion of social progress&nbsp; but tries to focus greater self-reflexive critique on categories.&nbsp; But such crtiqiue she notes has also often moved away from Horkheimer's program of crtique of categories toward a critqiue of the ""affective conditions (rationaly, purpose, coherence, detachment) that have seemed to make argumetn or engagement possible."" (3)&nbsp; This icnludes Adorno's suspcion of isntrumetnal action in his later 1960s essays and Hall's emphasis ""in the 1990s on a cultural politics that is rooted in differentiation rather than in negation."" (3)&nbsp; AND it has also led cultural historians to ""assocaite critique with a greater range of social dynamics and embodied affects.""&nbsp; She refers to Michael Warner's studies of ""reverence"" and Jordana Rosenberg on ""enthrallment"" and Sianne Ngai on ""ugly feelings"".&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; Such subjects don't necessarily easily fit with critical theory since ""Enlightenment ideas of critique so much depend on the value of autonomous thinking and the freedom from religious political authority.""&nbsp; (3-4)&nbsp; BUT she notes that Ngai in particular believes that ""ugly feelings"" reveal that 20thc century artists have developed ""models of subjectivity, collectivity, and agency not entirely foreseen by past theorists of the commonwealth."" (quoted on 3).&nbsp; And more Ngai insists that to focus on the ""abnegation of agency"" in such ""ugly feelings"" can, in Walkowitz's words, ""can create opportunities&nbsp; for new refelection, reasoning, and self-cultivation"" just as thinking about the ""power of powerlessness.""&nbsp; (Walkotizy sitees p.18 and 14 in Ngai's study.&nbsp; Walkowitz adds in a phrase that has some power I thiink: ""...<strong>indeed, the willingness to relinquish physical or psychological control, to become temporarily and purposefully inattentive, or 'disconcertedÄ as Ngai puts it, is centralto early-twentieth-century conceptions of self-knowledge and of the limits of self-knowledge.""</strong> (4)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* In any case, this is how she approaches cosmpotianism and specifically hernotion of a ""cosmpolitan style.""&nbsp; She says that ""Cosmpoltian style is concerned with writers who have used naturalness, triviality, evasion, mix-ups, treason, and vertigo to generate specific projects of democratic individualism, onthe one hand, and of antifascism or anti-imperialiism , on the other.""&nbsp; (4)&nbsp; This comes out a ""new distrust of civilizing processes,a nd of hte role of art in these processes"" (4) that leads these writers to develop a ""critical cosmpolitanism"" that expresses an ambivalence about ""collective social projects.""&nbsp; (4)&nbsp; <strong>She thinks that cosmpolitanism has alwas involved a ""negotiation between distance and proximity."" (4)&nbsp; That said, the critical cosmopolitanism of her 20th and 21st century writers goes one step further into the dynamics bound up with notions lke distance and proximity when they ""emphasize conditions of limited or suspended agency, and they ask us to consider how conceptions of belonging are bound up in the production, classification, and reception of literary narratives."" (4)</strong> &nbsp; Later she notes that this ina&nbsp; different way saying that ""it is in their additional refletion on the relationships between narrative and political ideas of progress, aesthetic and social demands for literalism, and sexual and conceptual decorousness, that Conrad, Woolf, and Joyce make their most significant contributions to the analytic project of critical cosmopolitanism."" (5) &nbsp;</p>
<p>* One idea embbed here and indicated in the term ""style"" is that to examine cosmopolitanism critically is to see its role in history and that this&nbsp; means as she says on bottom of 4 not only seeing that cosmpolijntansim can support certain notions of imperialism, but also that it cosmpolitanism can involve certain ""analytical postures"" such that, for example, ""a commitment to collective agency may be a style rather than an index of transnational politics."" (4)&nbsp; But that style, she seems to imply, still has real and powerful consequences...</p>
<p>* Here is where her analysis of cosmpolitanism begins to intersect with modernism.&nbsp; She first defines modernism on 6.&nbsp; She says it ""involves strategies that respond to and engage with the experience of modernity, a condition of industrialization and 'spirit of critique,' as Dilip Parameshwar Gaonakr puts it, that shcoalrs now assocaiting not only with the past and with the West but also with the emergent practices of 'non-Western people everywhere.'"" (6)&nbsp; (She also uses Foucualt and Dipesh Chakrabarty to define it).&nbsp; Thus modernism for her involves strategies or styles that attempt to respond to modernity.&nbsp; Then her take on cosmpotlian style becomes one in which she seeks to diverge from thinkers like Terry Eagleton and Caren Kaplan who have argued that ""early-twentieth century writers used metaphors of exile to represnt various experiences of idsplacement"" by instead noting the power and effect of these gestures as styles or strategies.&nbsp; She thus argues instead that ""modernist writers troubled the distinction between local and global that most conceptions of exile have presuppposed."" In this sense, she is working with modernism in the way that Perciles Lewis, Jessica Berman, and Jed Esty have done she says, (6) (She could also add Susan Hegeman I think!)&nbsp;</p>
<p>(NOte that there is also here a link to the critique that Hollinger made in his essay ""Ethnic Diverstiiy, Cosmpolitanism, and the Emergence of the American Liberal Intelligentsia,"" when he notest that the theme of exile in the literature of the Am. liberals, e.g. Bourne, Cowley etc, is one that misses the positive content of these liberals' discourse... Hollinger doesn't&nbsp; think modenrism is a distinc thing it seems, and he means something else, ie he wants to critique their cosmpolitanism for being elitist, a fact that the exile/alienation theme implies and reproduces...) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Drawing on what she describes as a growing notion that many early 20th century writers following Walter Pater and Oscar Wilde saw ""individualism as a social and political cause"" (10-11)&nbsp; and the Chantal Mouffe's notion of politics as antagonistic and taking myriad forms, she wants to see the cosmpolitanism of her writers as forming a distinct kind of political consciousness:&nbsp; ""I argue that syncretic but less-than-rational tradition of cosmpolitanism, which is often associated with aesthetecism, dandyism, and <em>flanarie</em> at the fin de siecle, helped to establish a new analysis of perception and alternative tones of political consciousness among early modernist writers.""&nbsp; (12) Ie she is seeing a politics in the late-Victorian tradition of aeshetic decadence, central to British modernism, that involved ""a repertoire of excessive and purposefully deviant cultural strategies whose values include pleasure, consumption, szncretism, and perversity."" (12)&nbsp; This tradition she says ""amplifies the place of transcience and artificiality within models of national culture and tansnational mobility."" (12) She critiques existing studies of ""international modernism"" for having avoided this influence and focusing onyl on the ""outward-looking ntaure of cosmpolitanism"" and associating the avanteßgard only with ""tones of antagonism, timeliness, and heroci certainty."" (13) She sees as aligned with her project the attempts by Mica Nava, Monica L. Miller, Arjun Appadurai and Amitava Kumar to define a cosmpolitanism that does not only focus on people who travel, ie one that argues for the ""inclusion of consumption, imagination, longing, and fantasy among cosmopolitan pracctices in the twentietht century."" (13)&nbsp; She gives as an example Nava's insistnce that the exotic clothing of middle-class English women although it is not part of ""politics"" because ""it does not act within or on political institutions"" but it is part of the ""politcial"" because ""it shapes social relations of gender, bodily display, urban mobility, and transnational fantasy."" (13)</p>
<p>*&nbsp; She has here a very good and much moe concise section on ""modernist cosmpolitanism"" the main point of which is that the contemporary discussions eschew modernism, and in some cases reject it, but at the same time describe practices, techniques and practices that she thinks are inherent to modernism.&nbsp; So she ultimately argues quite forcefully that ""there is nos criticial cosmopolitanism without modernist practices"" (18) and by consequence that to take critical cosmpolitanism seriously assuming that it relies on such practices means that we must ""change what we claim about the relationship between idiosyncratic expression of culture and the conditions of international sympathy or reparation."" (18)&nbsp; I think what she means by the secon point is that we can't assume that a middle-class british woman buying exotic clothes is simply a close-minded consumer participating in a narrow form of identiity unrelated to a true cosmopolitan outlook.&nbsp; She sees Bruce Robbins <em>Feeling Global</em> book as one that seeks to exclude modernism, as he saw it in Sontag's demand that we participate in modernist aims of ""disorientation, defamiliarization, making strange.""&nbsp; And yet she notes that Robbins' cosmpoltianism is like modernism because it involves estrangement and hesitation and she inssits that he has in many ways been ""the strongest advocate of a theory of cosmpolitanism that requires rather than rejects aesthetic experience, 'strategic acquiescening,' and models of conscience tha are 'rooted in routine duties and pleasures as well as in once-in-a-lifetime renunciations.'"" (15) Another example is Walter Mignolo who limists cosmpolitanism to only those who have emerged from ""various spatial and historical lcaotion of the colonial&nbsp; difference"" but then talks about ""border thinking"" as involving <em>bricolage</em>, a key technique of the modernist tradition of aesthetic decadence. (16)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;* What is clear is that Walkowitz sees the focus on style and posture even in consumption as a way to democratize the approach to cosmpolitan politics.&nbsp; She says it here when specifying what she thinks are the consequences of her accoutn of crticial and alternative cosmpolanism: 1 she says that it ""suggestes that cultural strategies of posture have a significant role in even those cosmpolitan paradigms that involve actors who are not social elites or whose position in the world is not in all ways privileged"" (17)&nbsp; And this means that it may not be beste to critqiue cosmpolitanism by attempting to ""'dissociate' cosmpolitanism from the lienaments of 'class, hierarchy, and affluence'' but instead one should acknowledge the analytic complexities of the cosmpolitan traditoin."" (17-18) That's why she say that there is no critical cosmpolitanism withotu modernism.&nbsp;</p>"

It included from the beginning female charter members.  The American Ethnological Society ""made no explicit exclusion of women, but did not number women among its charter members in 1848 or for many years thereafter."" (39)  But when it was reorganized (when?) it included women (39)

When Wall Street Met Main Street: The Quest for an Investors' Democracy,"<p># Julia C. Ott, *When Wall Street Met Main Street: The Quest for an Investors' Democracy* (London, England: Harvard University Press, 2011)</p>
<p>&gt; Summary: Julia Ott's book describes the formation of an ideology of a ""shareholder democracy"" (5) or ""mass investment society"" (225) in the 1920s. Her point is that this idea is the basis for more recent forms of modern conservatism that are perhaps more frequently traced to neoliberal thinkers such as Hayek and Milton Friedman. Her critical point is that this notion of ""broad-based invesment as a social, political, and economic goal"" ought to be reassessed by Americans. Although this idea of a shareholder democracy has ""sometimes"" supported regulation and ""managerial restraint"" it has, she says, ""tended to marginalize questions about the distribution of economic wealth, security, and power. There has been wealth gained by some individuals, but because ""securities investment requires significant disposable income, the wealthiest segments of society have enjoyed its benefits most.""

<div>## Ch. 1 - The Problem with Financial Securities</div>
<div>*  This chapter describes the emergence of a new ""political-economic  ideal--in which mass investment in financial securities would  democratize modern captialism and restore propertied status to the  citizenry."" (34-35)&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>* This new ideal was a  response to the loss of property-based conceptions of citizenship in the  face of mass industrialization, a problem highlighted by the Populist  party and the critiques of Tom Watson. (12-21)&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>*  This new idea emerged gradually in three places, first, the U.S.  Senate's Industrial Commiission investigation, initiated by McKinley  after the election of 1898; then in the ideas of economicists Robert  Ely, Jeremiah Jenks, and John Bates Clark, and in the ideas of U.s.  District court Judge Peter S. &nbsp;Grosscup; then finally in the Pujo  Committee report. The basic idea here was to embrace economic  concentration but reject the laissez-faire form; that is, to say that if  properly regulated, shareholding might prrovide a way to democratize  modern capitalism and introduce something like property-ownershiop back  into the society. That is, this new ideal emerged **with** progressive  era reform...</div>"

Essays in Radical Empiricism (Selections),"<p>General Notes for Pragmatism Course</p>
<p><strong>A. Does Consciousness Exist?</strong></p>
<p>* James starts by making a critique of the notion of consciousness.&nbsp; He wants too deny that it exists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>* He's really critiquing the metaphysical dualism that he blames on Kant: ""At first, 'spirit and matter,' 'soul and body,' stood for a pair of equipollent substances quite on a par in weight and interest.&nbsp; Btu one day Kant undermined the soul and brought in the transcendental ego, and ever since then the bipolar relation has bene very much off its balance.&nbsp; The transcendental ego seems nowadays in rationalist quarters to stand for everything, in empiricist quarters for almost nothing."" (162)</p>
<p>* He wants to move instead toward a notion of experience.&nbsp; He says that he has for some time ""suggested the nonexistence [of consioucsness], and tried to give them its pragmatijc equivalent in realities of experience."" (163)&nbsp; Again experience: ""My thesis is that if we start with the supposition that there is only one primary stuff or material in the world, a stuff of which everything is composed, and if we call that stuff 'pure experience,' then knowing can easily be explained as a pqarticular sort of relation twoards one another into which portions of pure experience may enter.&nbsp; The relation itself is part of pure experience..."" (163)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* He goes through a refutation of the ""alternative view"" in which consciousness is central. He takes as a starting point neo-Kantian thought about which he says ""the evaporation of the definite soul-substance has proceeded as far as it can go without being yet complete."" (163)</p>
<p>1-&gt; For the neo-Kantians, he says the notion of consciousenss ""does no more than signalize the fact that expeirence is indefeasibly dualistic in structure."" (164)&nbsp; He goes on: ""To consciousness as such nothing can happen, for, timeless itself, it is only a witness of happenings in time, in which it plays no part.&nbsp; It is, in a word, but the logical correlative of 'content' in an Experience of which the peculiarity is that <em>fact comes to light</em> in it, that <em>awareness of content</em> takes place.&nbsp; Consciousness as such is entirely impersonal--'self' and its activiteis belong to content.&nbsp; To say that I am self-conscious, or conscious of putting forth volition, means only that certain contents, for which 'self' and 'effort of will' are the names, are not without witness as they occur."" (164)&nbsp;</p>
<p>2-&gt; But at the same time they suggest that we also have ""an immediate consciosusenss of consciousness itself."" (164)&nbsp; The idea, he notes, is that the idea of consciousnesss can be determined through analysis, ie that through analysis (he gives metaphor of separating the menstruum in pain from the pigment) conscousness can be demonstrated to be seaprate from the content of consciousness.&nbsp; (164-165)</p>
<p>*&nbsp; But he rejects this idea that there is a duplicity in experience.&nbsp; (165)&nbsp; Experience he says is a ""double-barelled"" term...it is both subjective and objective.&nbsp; He lists a series of other double-barrled terms that he thinks are replacing the single-barelled notions of thougth and thing: ""The dualism connoted by such double-barrleed terms as 'experience,' phenomenon,' 'datum,' '<em>Vorfindung</em>'--terms which, in philosphy at any rate, tend more and more to replace single-barrelled erms of 'thought' and 'thing'--that dualism, I say, is still preserved in thiis account, but reinterpreted, so that, instead of being mysterious and elusive, it becomes verifiable and concrete."" (166)</p>
<p>* He roots the source of this way of thinkingin Locke and Berkeley interestingly... (166)</p>
<p>* He gives a long explanation vv a room and one's consicousness of it/relationship to it.&nbsp; The basic problem in philosphy he thinks ahs been how to know how a thing exists in the world and also in the the mind.&nbsp; He notes that ""represenative "" theories ""avoid the logical paradox, but on the other hand they vioalte the reader's sense oflife, which knows no intervening metnal image but seems to see the room and the book immediately jsut as they physically exist."" (167)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* He summarizes the issue about how an object can be in the mind and in the world, but saying that it's like the problem of how a single point can be on two lines, and the answer is that it can if it lies where the lines intersect.&nbsp; This the case with the room example.&nbsp; Take the example of a room.&nbsp; It can be seen as lieing at the intersection of multiple processes.&nbsp; And the ""pure experience"" of the room can be thought of as lieing at an intersection.&nbsp; (167)&nbsp; Ie the experience of the room can be thought of a ""a member diverse processes that can be followed away from it along entirely different lines."" (167)&nbsp; It is both in the context of one's ""field of consciousnses"" and also ""the room in which you sit.""&nbsp; (167)&nbsp; ""it enters both contexts in its whoeleness,g giving no pretext for being said to attach itself to consciousness by one of its parts or aspects, and to outer reality by another."" (167)&nbsp; These two contexts are two procesess: the one the biography of the person, the other ""the histors of the house of which the room is part."" (167)&nbsp; He contarsts these two processes on 167-8 in a nubmer of ways.&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Now he applies the same principlpe to concepts as he just has to percepts.&nbsp; (168)&nbsp; ""If we take conceptual manifolds, or memories, or fancies, they also are in their first intention mere bits of pure experience, and, as such, are single <em>thats</em> which act in one context as objects, and in another context figure as mental states."" (168)&nbsp;&nbsp; He quotes Muensterberg to demonstrates this ""objectivity of non-perceptual experiences..."" (169)&nbsp;</p>
<p>*&nbsp; This means there's a kind of ""doubling-up of experience""...ie ""jsuta s the seen room...is <em>also</em> a field of consciousness, so the conceived or recollected room is <em>also</em> a state of mind..."" (171)&nbsp; The common ground of this doubling up of experience is the fact that in pure experience the same experience is an intersecting point of a series of lines of context and processes...&nbsp; Ie the basis is experience it seems.</p>
<p>* The doubling-up, though, doe snot imply division: ""As 'subjective' we say that the experience represents; as 'objective' it is represented.&nbsp; What represents, and what is represented, is here numerically the same; but we must remember that no dualism of being represented and representing resides in the experience <em>per se</em>.&nbsp; In its pure state, or when isolated, there is no self-splitting of it into conscoiusness and what the consciousness is 'of.' Its subjectivity and objectivity are functional attributes solely, realized only when the experience is 'taken,' i.e. talked of, twice, considered along with its two different contexts respectively, by a new retrospective experience, of which that whole past complication now forms the fresh content."" (172)&nbsp;</p>
<p>*&nbsp; So the ""pure experience"" is that which lies prior to this ""taken"" experience where the object is considered in relation to its two contexts, ie as seen object or idea.&nbsp; ""The instant field of the present it all times what I call the 'pure' experience.&nbsp; It is only virtually or poentially weither object or subject as yet.&nbsp; For the tie being, it is plain, unqualified actuality, or existence, a simple <em>that</em>..."" (172)&nbsp; This is the naive immediacty of expeirence prior to reflection...</p>
<p>* So&nbsp; he sums up that consciousness does not itelf exists but ""connotes a kind of external relation..."" (172)&nbsp; ""<em>The peculiarity of our experiences, that they not only are, but are known, which their 'conscious' quality is invoked to explain, is better explianed by their relations--these relations themselves being experiences--to one another."" (</em>173)&nbsp; Ie our experiences are peculiar because they both exist and we know about them,a nd what we call consciousness is simply a way to refer to that fact; but it would be more accurate to simply talk about the 1) the relationships between the things existence and our knowledge of it, and 2) how those relationship are also part of our experience...</p>
<p>* Now he deals with objections to his idea... in ther est of this essay.&nbsp; 173-178.&nbsp; Key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Things are for example ""extended"" in space, but thoughts not.&nbsp; Things are red or hot, etc, but thoughts not.&nbsp; This difference and the difficulty of explaining it would be explained by metaphysical dualism. But James challenges whether it's so true that, say, thoughts are not extended.&nbsp; He notes that everyone agrees that thoughts and things share certain properties, say their relationship to time.&nbsp; Also ""[b]oth are of kinds, can be compared, added and subtracted and arranged in serieal orders."" (174)&nbsp; Rer extension, he insists that our thoughts do have extension, say if we think of a foot-rule.&nbsp; ""The difference between objective and subjective extension is one of relation to a context solely.&nbsp; In the mIe ind the various extents maintain no necesssarily stubborn order relative to each other, while in the physical world they bound each other stably, and, added together, made the great envoloping Unit which we believe an and call real Space."" (175)&nbsp; The point then is that the difference is not that objects have qualities that our thoughts do not have, but that the relations of the qualities to things and the relationships of things in space is more definite for things.&nbsp; Another way to put this is that qualities in the objective world have consequences.&nbsp; A fire burns in a way that the thought of a fire does not.&nbsp; He's good on this on 175-6.&nbsp; Our sense of the subject/object distinction comes from the fact that ""as the general chaos of all our experiences gets sifted, we find that there are some fires that will always burn sticks and always warm our bodies, and that there are some waters that will always put our fires; while there are other firest that will not act at all.""&nbsp; (175-6)&nbsp; And later: ""With 'real' objects, on the contrary, conseqences always acrue;and thus the real experiences get sifted from the mental ones, the things from our thoughts of them, fanciful or true, and precipitated together as the stable part of the whole experience-chaos, under the name of the physical world.&nbsp; Of this our perceptual experiences are the nucleus, they being the originally <em>strong</em> experiences.&nbsp; We add a lot of concetual experiences to them, making these strong also in imagination, and building out the remoter parts of the physical world by their means; and around this core of reality the world of laxly connected fantasies and mere rhapsodical objects floats like a bank of clouds.&nbsp; In the clouds, all sorts of rules are violated which in the core are kept.&nbsp; Extensions there can be indefinitely located; motion there obeys no Newton's law."" (176)</li>
<li>Another critique that he brings up, the rationalist one?, that we are aware of our own consciousenss.&nbsp; That we <em>know</em> it.&nbsp; Here James refers to his materialistic sense of the ""stream of thinking"" which is just really a ""careless name for what, when scrutinized, reveals itself to consist chiefly of the stream of my breathing..."" (178).&nbsp; He writes; ""The 'I think' which Kant said must be able to accompany all my objects, is the 'i breathe' which actually does accompany them.' (178)&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>B. A World of Pure Experience</strong></p>
<p>* What would a radical empriicism be then for James?&nbsp; --&gt;&nbsp; It's got to not include anything that is not ""directly experience"" or exclude anything that is directly experienced.&nbsp; So that means that ""<em>relations that connect experiences must themselves be experienced relations, and any kind of relation experienced must be accounted as 'real' as anything else in the system</em>."" (178)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* This definitin runs counter to ""ordinary empricism"" that in his view ""has always shown a tendency to do away with the connections of things, and to insist most on the disjunctions."" (179)&nbsp; He references Berkeley's nominalism, Hume's idea that ""whatever things we distinguish are as 'loose and separate' as if they had 'no manner of connection...'"".&nbsp; Also James Mill and John Mill.&nbsp; And so on.&nbsp; He speaks also of John Mill's ""account of both physcial things and selves as composed of discontinuous possibilities, and the general pulverization of all Experience by assocaition and the mind-dust theory..."" (179)&nbsp; And he notes that the ""natural result of such a world-picture has been the efforts of rationalism to corret its incoherencies byt he addition of transexperiential agents of unification, substances, intellectual categories and powers, or Selves..."" (179)&nbsp; His sense is that ""if empiricism had only been radical and taken everything that comes without disfavor, conjunction as well as separation, each at its face value, the results would have called for no such artificial correction."" (179)</p>
<p>* Taht is, he thinks that ""radical empricism"" can account for ""conjuctive relations"" without relying on a notion that they are true in some ""supernal way, as if the unity of things and their variety belonged to different orders of truth and vitality altogether."" (179)&nbsp; Ie he thinks that the rationalists accusation that empiricists can't account for how the world of sensations holds together is false...</p>
<p>* He provides a useful metaphor to speak of the two traditions: ""<em>Prima facie</em>, if you should liken the universe of absolute idealism to an aquarium, a crystal globe in which goldfish are swimming, you would have to compare the empiricist universe to something more like one of those dried human heads with which the Dyaks of Borneo deck their lodges.&nbsp; The skull forms a solid nucleus; but innumerable feathers, leaves, stings, beads, and loose appendices of every description float and dangle from it, and, save that they terminate in it, seem to have nothing to do with one another.&nbsp; Even so my experiences and yours float and dangle, terminating, it is true, in a nucleus of common perception but fo rth emost part out of sight and irrelevant and unimaginable to one another."" (180)&nbsp; He thinks that what he calls this ""imperfect intimacy"" of things with each other... or&nbsp; their ""bar e realtion of <em>withness</em> between some parts of the sum total of experiencea nd other parts"" is what empricism over-emphasizes and rationalism tries to ignore.&nbsp; Whereas his ""radical empiricism"" he think ""is fair to both the unity and the disconnection..."" (181)</p>
<p>* <strong>The ""conjunctive relation""</strong> ie relatinon of connection, that has he says been most tbouelsome to philosphy is the ""<em>co-conscious transition</em>...by which one experiences passes into another when both belong to the same self."" (181)&nbsp; ""Personal histories are processes of change in time , and the <em>change itself is one of the things immediately experienced</em>.&nbsp;  'Change' in this case means continuous as opposed to discontinuous  transition."" (181)&nbsp; This idea of continous transitiion is ""one sort of  conjunective relation"" but he says to be a ""radical empiricist is to focus on this kind of connection because it is where he ays so much corrupt thinking (ie ""Metaphysical fictions"") have entered in.&nbsp; It is then to take this relation at ""face value, enither less nor more; and to take it at its face value means first of all to take it just as we feel it, and not to confuse ourselves with abstract talk <em>about </em>it, involving words that drive us to invent secondary conceptions in order to neturalize their suggestions and to make our actual experience again seem rationally possible."" (181)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* What is key is that continuity is a ""definite sort of experience,"" different from the experience of disctontinuity. (181)&nbsp; And he says that's it.&nbsp; There's no other ""whatness"" to the experience of change and development other than the ""absence of break and this sense of continuity in that most intimate of all conjunctive relations, the passing of one experience into another when they belong to the same self."" (182)&nbsp; This is all there is to it, but he notes that ""all experiences have their conditions"" and what has happened he thinks is that ""over-subtle intellects"" have in asking how those conditions are possible, subsutited conceptions for the pure experience.&nbsp; That's how one has got to these notions of Absolutes or Substances.&nbsp; (182)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* <strong>The cognitive relation</strong>.&nbsp; This kind of radical empricism he thinks can save us from a pitfall common to philosphy, namely metpahysical dualism which he refers to as&nbsp; ""an artificial conception of the <em>relations between knower and known"" </em>in which there an absolute discontinuity has always been posited.&nbsp; He quicly summarizes the attempts to resolve the problem: by common-sense theorists, by representative associationalism, and by transcendentalists.&nbsp; (183)&nbsp; BUT he notes that all the while there was in the ""very bosom of finite experience"" already the answer.&nbsp; He lists three cases on 183 of which he develops an exampel of #2, ie the case in which&nbsp; the knower and the known are ""two pieces of <em>actual</em> experience belonging to the same subject, with definite tracts of conjunctive transitional experience..."" (183)&nbsp; The example he uses is him sitting in the library at Cambridge and thinking of Harvard's Memorial Hall.&nbsp;&nbsp; He may have a clear image of it in his mind, or just know it's name.&nbsp; Then he asks you to suppose that he's got to lead you to the hall, and he fails to do so.&nbsp; Then you might rightly say that whatever the image in his head, it was not that hall that was ""meant.""&nbsp; On the other hand, if he succesfully leads you to the Hall, then the idea seems to have been ""terminated"", <em></em>however imperfect it was to begin with.&nbsp; <strong><em>""</em>In this continuing and corroborating, taken in no transcendental sense, but denoting definitely felt transitions<em>, lies all that the knowing of a percept by an idea can possibly contain or signify</em>.&nbsp; Whereever such transitions are felt, the first experience <em>knows</em> the last one.&nbsp; Where they do not, or where even as possibiles they can not, intervene, there can be no pretence fo knowing.&nbsp; In the latter case the extremes will be connected, if connected at all, by inferior relations--bare likeness or succession, or by 'withness' alone.&nbsp; Knowledge of sensibile realities thus come to life inside the tissue of experience.&nbsp; It is <em>made</em>; and made by realtions that unroll themselves in time."" (185)&nbsp; </strong>So somewhat as he'd said with the notion of conjunctive in the experi(ence of a self that that experiecne is just the experience of the absence of break, nothing more nothing less, here too knowing is just this kind of link between a thought and it's termination. It provides a sensation of greater and greater fulfillment as an idea leads to a sensible experience of a percept.&nbsp; And this is all there is to knowing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>* He puts it another way.&nbsp; We know no ""more real kind of union <em>aliunde</em>"".&nbsp; So ""unions by continuous transition"" are all we know.&nbsp; Even if there were ""more absolute unions realized"" we would still only know them through the same ""conjunctive results.""&nbsp; (186)&nbsp; Why? To put it another way, if there were an Absolute, it would override experience where a knower knowing something else in experience would be gone.&nbsp; Otherness would be just an illusion.&nbsp; (186)&nbsp; But on the other hand if the world is one ""where both the terms and their distinctions are affairs of experience, conjunctions taht are experienced must be at least as real as anything else."" (186)</p>
<p>* He sums up the process of a thougth moving to fulfulment of a percept, in which the percept simply verifies the concept on bottom 186.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">* <strong>Substiuttion</strong>. What's so important about this kind of knowing for human life is that an experience (like an idea) that ""knows another can figure as its <em>represenative</em>, not in any quasi-miraculous 'epistemological' sense, but in the definite practical sense of being its <em>substitute</em> in various operations, sometimes physical and sometimes mental, which leads us to its assocaites and results."" (187)&nbsp; We then can ""experiment on our ideas of reality"" without needing to experiment on the ""real experiences which they severally mean."" (187) &nbsp; And these ideas ""form related systems, corresponding point for point to the systems which the realities form; and by letting an ideal term call up its associates systematically, we may be led to a terminus whch the corresponding real term would have led to in case we had operated on the real world."" (187)&nbsp; This is substitution.&nbsp; This is key...&nbsp;&nbsp; What does it mean?&nbsp; For James, experience is a process unfodling in time that can be conjunctive or disjunctive.&nbsp; The experiences he's interested here are those that build on previous experiences and that bring one nearer a goal.&nbsp; They can in a way be said to fulfill a function.&nbsp; To think this way about function vv a world of pure experience is to say that the only events that occcur are transitions and arrivals/terminations, but transitions and terminations can happen by many paths.&nbsp; When two experiences lead to the same termination/end by different paths they are functionally equivalent.&nbsp; And now ""the whole system of experiences as they are immeidately given presents itself as a quasi-chaos through which one can pass out of an initial term in many directions and yet end in the same terminus, moving from next to next by a great many posible paths."" (188)&nbsp; Some paths might be better than others, however, in certain cirumstances, and James says that ""the paths that run through conceptual experiences, that is, through 'thoughts' or 'ideas' that 'know' the things in which tley terminate, are highly advantageous paths to follow."" (188)&nbsp; That's because 1) they often involve rapid transitions, and 2) they have a universal character often and a ""capacity for association with one another in great systems"" that means they ""outstrip the tardy consecutions of the things themselves, and sweep us towards our ultimate termini in a far more labor-saving way than the following of trains of sensible perception ever could."" (188)&nbsp; Now he says most ""thought-paths"" are ""substitutees for nothing actual"" and simply ""end outside the real world altogether , in wayward fancies, utopias, fictions or mistakes."" (188)&nbsp; But he says where they do ""re-enter reality"" we ""substitute them always."" (188)&nbsp; And ""with these substiutes pass the greater number of our hours."" (188)</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">* Now he has an oustanding paragarph on 188-189, where he brings back the metaphor of the Dayak heads.&nbsp; He calls experience a ""quasi-chaos"" because there is ""vastly more discontinuity in the sum total of experiences that we commonly suppose.""&nbsp; The ""objective nucleus"" of each person's experience is the body, which is itself a ""continuous percept"".&nbsp; But outside of it there is a distant physical world ""at all times absent from us"".&nbsp; Its parts ""form conceptual objects merely, into whcih the preceptual reality of which our life inserts itself at points discrete and realtively rare."" (189)&nbsp; Individual thinkers working around their ""several objective nuclei""&nbsp; of the real world, which are partly shared and partly discrete, ""trace paths that intersect one another only at discontinuous perceptual points, and the rest of the time are quite incongruent; and around all the nuclei of shared 'reality,' as around the Dyak's head of my late metaphor, floats the vast cloud of expereinces that are wholly subjective [ie that are not substitutes of any actual real world experience], that are non-substitutional, that find not even an eventual ending for themselves in the perceptual world--the mere day-dreams and joys and sufferings and wishes of the individual minds.""

"Lost and Found: Remembering Modernism, Rethinking Feminism","<p>Quick Summary 6/29/10</p>
<p>This article provdides a good survey of the lit on women, gender, and modernism.  It's overall argument as the title indicates is to suggest that future readings should move beyond the attempt to claim women as modernists true propogators and men and mysogynists or the reverse.  She calls for a more ""culturally based criticism"" that is at the same time historically specific and  interdisciplinary (12)  And she wants  more subtle readings that show the tensions between conventionality and modernism in both male and female modernists.  She ends with a good quote from Eysteinsson's <em>The Concept of Modernism</em> (1990) in which he is critizing one of the major texts trying to resituate modernism as in the field of women writers by Gilbert and Gubar <em>No Man's Land</em> (a multivolume work).  He writes:</p>
<p><em>""How do male modenrists support patriarchal laws, and how are they at the same time 'otherwise avant-garde'?  Are some of them perhaps torn between deep-rooted and patriarchal social habits, still guiding their individual lives, and a radical new view of human subjectivity expressed through language or whatever their artistic medium might be?  If such were the case, we might come to the conclusion that whatever their individual positions as social beings, their literary discourse works to disrupt patriarchal structures?""

"Reading Obama: Dreams, Hope, and the American Political Tradition","<p>3. Chapter 2</p>
<p>*  This is a complex chapter in which K traces currents of ""intellectual life"" in the last half of the twentieth century. At the outset, he says that Obama ""captured the central dynamic"" in the start of <em>Dreams</em> when he describes his grandparents as entertaining a ""useful fiction"" that they were kliving in a ""bright new world where differences or race and cutlure would instruct and amuse and perhaps even ennoble."" (86)  But for Obama this ""useful fiction"" was something that ""haunted' him and his family. (86)</p>
<p>* The key to understanding why this ""fiction"" would ""haunt"" Obama, K says one must understand the ""struggle between different worldviews that developed in America--and not only in America... "" (87)  K thinks that focusing on the ""towering figure"" of John Rawls is a helpful way to simplify the compelxity of the late 20th century intellectual life in America.  He says that he will use ""themes from Rawls's life and work to trace an arc that characterizes much of American thought in recent decades.  Unless we understand that arc, we cannot understand the amalgam of deeply held principles and frankly admitted uncertainties that characterizes Obama's approach to public life."" (87)</p>
<p>* American social thought since mid-century K says has been ""marked by a struggle between the champions of foundationalism and universalism--that 'useful fiction' animating champions of international law and interracial harmony--and challengers who deny the existence of unchanging truths."" (88)  Obama's ""sensibility"" K says is a product of that struggle... (88)  When Obama speaks of being ""haunted"" by the ideals of h is parents and grandparents...it is the attraction of these universal ideals that he is feeling K says.</p>

"Vigorous Male and Aspiring Female: Poetry, Personality, and Culture in Edward Sapir and Ruth Benedict","Summary Note

Handler here examines the interactions between Sapir and Benedict from the point of view of the new culture of ""personality"" and the stress on developing a certain ""hardness,"" a term Handler takes from Pound's explanation of the relatoinship between self-expression and poetic form.  This was manifested in ""an absolutely original use of language, because the individual's unique experience could not be conveyed through conventional language, encumbered as it is ith dead metaphors and cliche."" (98)  Or as Croce put it Handler says as a ""direct intijon of reality"" (99)  Handler examines Sapir and Benedict's relaiton to this ideal, one which is troublesome for both but especially for Benedict, because ""hardness"" has masculine characteristics.  (Though he demonstrates that it was problematic for both, and thus in a way that gender was in general not clear in this time. See Monroe critique of Sapir, 110).    Then Handler interprets it in terms of Sapir and Benedict's differing theories of culture.  (116-119), Benedict reified culture in relation to the problem of culture.  For Sapir it was ""spuriousness"" which Handler empahsizes as being the ""therapeutic"" culture of the U.S.; whereas Benedict emphasizes the ""maleability"" of the individual and therefore intolerance became the problem.  Finally, Handler breaks this difference down in terms of the approach to 'social engineering', the idea being that Benedict's approach lent itself to this by stressing the maleability of the individual and Sapir's did not b/c he expected only great artists to be creative and because he thought it useless to try to become aware of one's rationality. (119-122)    Interestingly, Handler concludes saying that in contrast to Sapir who retreated from poetry into what he called ""purely technical lingusitic erudition..."" (quoted on 121, 121-122), Benedict ""discovered her convincing sense of selfhood not simply in anthropology as scholarship but in the role of the technical expert, the scientific creator who puts her individual talents at the service of the collectivity."" (122) [i.e. public intellctual.] And Handler is in fact very optimistic about their tact: ""One could play such a role cautiously (Benedict) or boldly (Mead), but in either case it uaranteed a genuine self and at least the promise of a genuine culture--one in which hardness and softeness would no longer matter."" (122)

I'm not sure that Handler earned that final discrimination between Sapir and Benedict.  How could Mead and Benedict have achieved a ""genuine self"" when the hadn't redefined, or at least he hasn't stated that they did redefine, what selfhood was?  And what was the basis of such selfhood if personality was ""maleable""?  What he's missing I think is what I try to provide which is a more concrete context for the discussion of selfhood.  Selfhood can be reconceived around the general political-philosophical problem of the individual's need to react to coercion in modern institutions.  I.e. Sapir's is a reaction to that problem.  Mead and Benedict's too...but it cuts in a different way, partly because they are women who have been allowed to finally take a somewhat authoratative role within these institutions.  Their approach to them is going to be all different.  Handler provides evidence for that here but no demonstrates no analytical understanding of it."

The Culture of the Thirties,"p. 153-154 Claim about Domestication of Culture

""In sketching this structure, o fact is more significant than the general and even popular 'discovery' of the concept of culture.  Obviously, the idea of culture was anything but new in the 1930s, but there is a special sense in which the idea became widespread in the period.  what had been discovered was 'the inescapable interrelatedness of...things' so that culture could no longer be considered what Matthew Arnold and the intellectuals of previous generations had often meant--the knowledge of the highest achievements of men and of intellect and art through history--but rather reference to 'allthings that a group of people inhabiting a common geographical area do, the ways they do things and their values and symbols.'  The remarkable popularity of Ruth Benedict's <i>Patterns of Culture</i> (1934)--surely one of the most widley read works of professional anthropology every published in the United States--provides us iwht a symoblic landmark.  Its impact was significant; but more important, her anlaysis of the possibility of different cultural patterns and the way such patterns shape and account for individual behavior was part of a more genral discovery of the idea itself, the sense of awareness of what it means to <i>be</i> a culture, or the search to <i>become</i> a kind of culture.  'The quest for culture,' one studnet of the problem suggests,'is the search for meaning and value.'  It is not too extreme to porpose that it was during the Thirties that the idea of culture was domesticated, with important consequences.  American then began thinking in terms of patterns of beahvior and belief, values and life-styles, symbols and meanings.  It was during this period that we find, for the first time, frequent reference to an 'American Way of Life."" (153-154)."

<p>Men spent less time in homosocial atmosphere of 1890s: polling places, party caucuses, lodges, saloons.  They spent more time going to movies, dating, watching spectator sports.  Or at home, listening to the radio or on the front porch.  Textbooks on ""Marriage and the Family"" informed highschool and college students that they needed to develop ""healthy heterosexuality"" and a ""satisfying emotional life."" (quoted on 221)  Women who were working in reform were accused of being ""castrated men"" and also that a ""life without sexual love was not entirely without joy."" (quoted on 221).</p>

Eccentric Flows and Cosmopolitan Culture,"<p>Summary Notes Feb 2012:</p>
<p>William Connolly, “Eccentric Flows and Cosmpolitan Culture” in Neuropolitics: Thinking, Culture and Speed (Minneapolis &amp; London: Univerisity of Minnesotta Press, 2002), 176-202.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Connolly wants to argue against the “concentric model of political culture” (184), which he finds variably in Kant, Samuel Huntington and Martha Nussbaum.&nbsp; The idea is that identity flows outward concentrically from the individual to the family to the neighborhood to the community to the nation and then to Western civilization and so on.&nbsp; That idea precludes the possibility of what Connolly calls “eccentric connections” that cut across concentric forms of affiliation and solidarity and indeed against the “connotation of isolation, perversity, and marginalization” that is involved in the concentric model of political culturre and identity.&nbsp; To focus on eccentric connections is to “identify eccentric flows of flight, compassion, connection, allegiance, identification, legitimacy, responsiveness and responsibility that exceed the concentric image of how political culture does and must function.” (185)&nbsp; <br />Recognizing such connections is also to take advantage, Connolly thinks, of the kinds of opportunities that social acceleration (he is drawin on the work of Paul Virilio who only sees the negative sides, and not drawing on Hartmut Rosa’s work) provides, for such eccentric connections become more likely in our tightly integrated and accelerated world of communication and transportation.&nbsp; Connolly’s sense is that we must with some urgency recognize the way our accelerated world makes possible eccentric flows and connections in order to have a chance to salvage a cosmopolitan possibility.&nbsp; He writes at the end of the article: “...the jig is up.&nbsp; As the hope to secure a single regulative idea [ie Kant’s idea that extends through to Nussbaum] is shaken by a world spinning faster and faster than heretofore, a small window of opportunity opens to negotiate a plural matrix of cosmpolitanisms.” (199)<br />The philosophical core of the article comes in a section “Toward a New Matrix of Cosmpolitanism,” where he attempts to critique Kant’s understanding of universal morality as a single “regulative idea.”&nbsp; He has articluated Kant’s take on this earlier in the article, pp. 180-182, as relying primarily on a highly suspect “apodictic recognition”, ie it is true because it must be true according to Kant.&nbsp; In this section, he tries to say that Kant’s regulative idea, if modified, might still be helpful.&nbsp; What has to be jettisoned is the idea that there’s only one regulative idea.&nbsp; From his point of view, in addition to the highly suspect reliance of this notion apodictive form of proof, this is also just no longer a sustainable position, given that Europeans are now so aware of the existence of multiple regulative ideas.&nbsp; Awareness of genealogy, deconstruction and political disturbance (ie those things that poststructuralist and postmodern critiques hav eprovide) can be deployed to call into question the idea that certain moral sources are incontestable, but positive work he thinks may require some sort of “regulative idea”.&nbsp; He thinks we can recognize the existence of a plurality of regulative ideas in the world, and also recognize the way we need these ideas, but without putting one up over another.&nbsp; (195)&nbsp; Eccentric connections can thus give us a chance to locate “creative lines of connection to other orientations.” (196)</p>"
Mass Culture as Woman: Modernism's Other,"<p>Notes 6/26/10</p>
<p>* H starts by pointing out that Flaubert--a father of modernist aesthetics--read romance novels and yet the Madame Bovary ends up dieing while he becomes a hero of a new aesthetics ""based on the uncompromising repudiation of what Emma Bovary loved to read."" (45)  IN fact, Flaubert famously said: ""Madame Bovary, c'est moi.""</p>
<p>* So H sees the presentation of woman as the ""avid consumer of pulp"" as paradigmatic to modernism (46).  The same idea is also central, he notes, to woman writers with ambitions like those of the ""great (male) modernist"".  He says Christa Wolf (who he has been citign) cites the work of Ingeborg Bachmann and quotes Wolf: ""...Bachmann is that nameless woman in <em>Malina</em>, she is the woman Franza in the novel fragment <em>The Franza CAse</em> who simply cannot get a grip on her life, cannot give it a form; who simply cannot manage to make her experience into a presnetable story, cannot produce it out of herslef as an artistic product."" (46) -- i.e. like M. Bovary.</p>
<p>* H now notes that the problem of ""saying I"" for a woman, which Wolf he says has also highlighted in her own novels, is also a problem of any ""post-romantic [i.e. modenrist]"":  ""Having first created the determining conditions for a certain historically specific type of subjectivity (the Cartesian cogito and the epistemological subject in Kant, as well as the bourgeois entrepreneur and the modern scientist), modernity itself has increasingly hollowed out such subjectivity and rendered its articulation highly problematic.  Most artists, male or female, know that."" (46)</p>
<p>* But H wants to say: there is a difference in terms of how the problem presents itself to the woman writer and the man.  I.e. Flaubert's statement Madame Bovary, c'est moi is different than the ""impassibilite'"" of the novel's style H says.  ""Given the fundamentally differing social and psychological constitution and validation of male and female subjectivity in modern bourgeois soceity, the difficulty of saying 'I' must of necessity be different for a woman writer, who may not find 'impassibilite'' and the concomitatng reification of self in the aesthetic product quite as attractive and compelling an ideal as the male writer.  The male, after all, can easily deny his own subjectivity for the benefit of a higher aesthetic goal, as long as he can take it for granted on an experiential level in everyday life."" (46)  So he quotes Wolf agian that modernist aesthetics is not tyring to help people get closer but rather farther away from ""reality""...So H says that this seems right, that what is being warded off in work from Flaubert to Roland Barthes, is the """"realities of modern life and the ominous expansion of mass culture thoughout the social realm"" which of course is usually presented in the image of a woman.</p>
<p>* H concludes the first section of his essay then by saying that this link (insofar for example as it is evident in Flaubert) between moernist aesthetics and a flight from mass culture is central to the modernism.  ""Mass cutlure has always beeen the hidden subtext of the modernist project."" (47)</p>
<p>* INterestingly, H notes that the equation of mass culture with the feminine has been abandoned by more recent critics, e.g. Adorno and Horkheimer, in favor of ""streamlining, technological reproduction, adminsitration and SAchlichkeit"" which would be assigned to the male realm, but he notes that the feminine identification still makes its appearance, e.g. in Kracauer's Tiller Girls in his important esssay on ""mass ornament."" (48)</p>
<p>* H critiques a thread of french literary criticism (associated with Kristeva e.g.) that has attempted to ""claim the space of modernist and avant-garde writing as predominantly feminine..."" (49)  This he thinks is ""highly questionable"" because it ignores the ""powerful masculinist and misogynist current within the trajectory of modernism, a current which time and again openly states its contempt for women and for the masses and which had Nietzsche as its most eloquent and influential representative."" (49)</p>
<p>* Now he gives some quick examples of how mass culture was gendered feminine (p.50-51).  Then he states ...""the gendering of an inferior mass cutlure as feminine goes hand in hand with the emergence of a male mystique in modernism (especially in painting), which as been documented thoroughly by feminist scholarship.  He points to essays by CArol Duncan and Norma Broude in <em>FEminism and Art History</em>.  Also Valerie Jaudon and Joyce Kozloff, ""ARt Hysterial Notions' of Progress and Cutlure,"" <em>Heresies </em>, 1, no.4 (Winter 1978): 38-42.</p>
<p>* Then oin the 2nd half of the 19th century he says what happens is a ""certain chain effect of signification: from the obsessively argued inferiority of woman as artist (clasically argued by Karl Scheffler in <em>Die Frau und die Kunst</em>, 1908) to the assocation of womanwith mass culture (witness Hawthorne's 'the damned mob of scribbling women') to the identification of woman iwth the masses as a poltiical threat."" (50)</p>
<p>* Nietzche is key here becuase he ascribes feminine characteristics to the mob and this is always tied to ""his aeshetic vision of the artist-philosoher-hero, the suffering loner who stands in irreconcialble opposition to modern democracy and its inauthentic culture."" (51)  This comes out in particular in his polemic against Wanger apparently, who was corrupted by ""adoring women."" Then he transforms music into ""mere spectacle, theater, delusion..."" (51)  So N says that WAgner signifies the ""emergence of the actor in music..."" (quoted on 51).  So Wagner signifies the same thing as Victor Hugo in ""declining cultures, wherever the decision comes to rest with masses, authetncitiy bcomes superfluous, disadvantageous, a liability. Only the actors still arouses <em>great</em> enthusiasm."" (quoted on 51)  So then H writes that ""WAgner, the theater, the mass, woman--all become a web of signification outside of, and in opposition to, true art: 'No one brings along the finest sense of his art to the theater; whatever is perfect suffers no witnesses.  In the theater one becomes people, herd, female, pharisee, voting cattle, patron, idiot--Wagnerian.'"" (51)</p>
<p>* So whta is being chastised her is the ""spectacle"" or what Baudrillard calls the simulacrum.  It's no accident H notes that the theater is what is being criticized since this was one of the few spaces that bourgeois society allowed women to enter in public, ""preicsley because acting was seen as imitative and reproductive, rather than original and productive."" (51)</p>
<p>* When H quotes N again here now it is the inifinte and the sea (cf Theweleit) that one encoutners: in WAgner's ""infinite melody"" one ""walks into the sea, gradually loses one's secure footing, and finally surrenders onself to the elements without reservation."" (N quoted on 51).</p>
<p>* This is all political H points out.  He notes that int he late 19th century ""a specific traditional male image of woman served as a receptacle for all kinds of projections, displaced fears, and anxieties (both personal and political), which were brought about by modernization and the new social conflicts, as well as by the specific historical events such as the 1848 revolution,t he 1870 Commune, and the rise of reactionary mass movements which, as in Austria, threatened the liberal order."" (52)  So now he cites Theweleit's stuffa bout the mob being represented as an engulfing feminine flood: ""Images of the raging mov as hysterical, of the engulfing floods of revolut and revolution, of the swamp of big city life, of the pspreading ooze of massification, of the figure of the red whore at the barricades--all of these pervade the wriign of the mainstream media, as well as that of right-wing ideolgoues of the late 19th can dearly 20th centuries whose social pscyholgy Klaus Theweleit has perceptively anlyzed in his study of <em>Male Phantasies</em>.  The fear of the masses in this age of declining liberalism is always also a fear of woman, a fear of nature out of control, a fear of unconscious, of sexuality, of the loss of identity and stable ego boundaries in the mass."" (52)   This is exemplified in Gustave Le Bon's <em>The Crowd</em> in which ""the male fear of woman and the bourgeois fear of the masses become indistinguishable."" (52) All this justifies the male fear of losing the self's ""stable ego boundaries"" and the revolt against devalued cutlural forms which have been gendered as feminine. (52-53)</p>
<p>* This makes modernism look more like  'reaction formation"" (53) rather than something heroic.  The fact that modernsim would considering this insight seem less heroic is, H says, appropriate: ""...the powerful masculinist mystique which is explicit in modernists such as Marineetti, Junger, Benn, Wyndham Lewis, Celine, et al. (not to speak of Marx, Nietzsche and Freud), and implicit in many others, has to be somehow related to the persitent gendering of mass cutlure as feminine and inferior--even if, as a result, the heroism of the modern won't look quite as heroic any more."" (55)  And now H insists that the ""modernists insistence on purity and authonomy in art, Freud's privileging of the ego over the id and his insistence on stable, if flexible, ego boundaries, andMarx's privileging of production over consumption"" are all homologically related in opposition to the fear of losing one's self in a feminine mass culture... (55)</p>
<p>* But what then is the relationship of modernism to modernity that gave rise to it...Here he hits on the point that to ""our postmodern age"" modernism appears to have been ""deeply implicated in the processes andp ressure ofthe same mundane modernization it so ostensibly repudiates."" (56)  He uses Adorno and Greenberg--who are defenders of modernism--to show that they both always understood modernism to be a ""reaction formation"" and therefore a product of captialism as much as mass culture.  Indeed, he has a quote from Adorno to Walter Benjamin: ""Both [modernist art and mass culture] bears the scars of captialism, both contain elements of change.  Both are torn halves of freedom to which, howeer, they do not add up."" (58)  <strong>But H adds to this: ""But the discussion cannot end here.  The postmodern crisis of high modernism and its classical accounts has to be seen as a crisis both of captialist modernization itself and of the <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">deeply patriarchal structures that support it</span>.""

The Anthropologist as Hero,"<p>Notes 7/29/10:</p>
<p>Reading this essay again to see if it might be useful for the Conclusion of the dissertation.</p>
<p>Sontag's essay starts by stating that ""serious"" modern literature deals with the theme of ""homelessness.""</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The felt unreliability of human experience brought about by the inhuman acceleration of historical change has led every sensitive modern mind to the recording of some kind of nausea, of intellectual virtigo.(69)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then solution</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...seems to be, at least initially, to exacerbate it.  Modern thought is pleged to a kind of applied Hegeleanism: seeking its Self in its Other.  Europe seeks itself in the exotic--in Asia, in the Middle East, among pre-literate peoples, in a mythic America; a fatigued rationality seeks itself in the impersonal energies of sexual exctasy or drugs; consicousness seeks it meaning in unconsicouness; humanistic problems seek their oblivion in scientific 'value neutrality' and quantification.  Th 'other' is expereinced as a harsh purification of the 'self.  But at the same time the 'self' is busy colonizing all strange domains of experience.  Modern sensibility moves between two seeminly contradictory but actually related impulses: surrender to the exotic, the strange, the other; and the domestication of the exotic, chiefly through science. (69-70)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ok...so where does anthropology fit in.  Philosphers have contributed to ur understanding of this modern problem, but it is poets, novelist, and some painters that have lived it.  Then she turns to Levi-Strauss, whom she says ""invented anthropollgy as a total occupation, invoving a spiritual commitment like that of the creative artist or the adventurer or pscyhoanalyst."" (70)</p>
<p>She notes that he is a scholar and not a ""man of letters.""  But she says that his Tristes Tropique is a work of genius with a ""human voice."" But what is he saying here that she finds most interesting?</p>
<p>She notes that Simone de Beauvoir recalled Levi-STrauss as a ""young philosophy student-teacher expounding 'in his detached voice, and with a deadpan expression...the folly of passsions."" (72)  Sontag builds on this noting that L-S prefaced his book with a motto by Lucretius: De rerum natura.  She says; L-S's ""aim is very much like Lucretius, the Graecophile Roman who urged the study of the natural sciences as a mode of ethical psychotherapy.  The aim of Lucretius was not independent scientific knowledge, but the reduction of emotional anxiety."" (72)  She describes that Lucreitus saw man as divided by sexual pleasure, emotional loss, superstituion, and fear.  Science was  for him a way to regain ""pscyhological gracefullness."" (73)</p>
<p>She says that L-S sees humans with ""Lucretian pessimism,"" but the problem is history, which has laid ruin to everything.  The tropics are tristes, she notes.  What L-S proposes then is not the kind of seeking of dramatic oblivion, but the same technique as a kind of practice, what L-S calls ""anthropological doubt,"" which he installs as a technique in his <em>Structural Anthropology</em>.  She quotes him: ""This 'anthropological doubt' consists not merely in knowning that one knows nothing but in resolutely exposing what one knows, even one's own ignorance, to the insults and denials inflicted on one's dearest ideas and habits by those ideas and habits which may contradict them to the highest degree."" (quoted on 73)</p>
<p>So then Sontag observes that anthropology provides a unique solution to the problem of modern alienation: ""Anthropology conquers the estranging function of the intellect by institutionalizing it.  The anthropologists is not simply a neutral observer.  He is a man of control of, and even consciously exploiting, his own intellectual alientation."" (74)  (L-S she says call his profession a ""<em>technique de depayesment""  (</em>this word I think can mean exile, change of environment, habits, etc..)</p>
<p>It's interesting here that Sontag reads this as a form of mastery--as if L-S is reacting to the problem of homelessness in a truly masculine way.  She even says: Anthropology ""is one of the rare intellectual vocations which do not demand a sacrifice of one's manhood.  Courage, love of adventure, and physical hardiness--as well as brains--are all called upon."" (74)</p>
<p>Sontag says that the anths world is divided between ""'home' and 'out there,' the domestic and the exotic, the urban academic world and the tropics.  ... So she says he becomes the ""very model of the 20th century consciouness: a 'critic at home' and a 'conformist elsehwere.'"" (74)  As a resutl, also, the anthropologist cannot act as a citizen, and apparently L-S acknowledges this...stating that he can ""only be a critical dissenting voice."" (74)</p>
<p>Funnily, she think American anthropologists were mere ""data-collectors.""  How wrong!  (75)</p>
<p>Interstingly, also, she has Levi-Strauss saying that the purpose of the fieldwork is actually to produce they ""pscyholgoical revolution"" which is the decisive poitn in the training of the anthropologist. (75)</p>
<p>She keeps reading L-S against the A. Anthropologists, but she gets them wrong I think.  Maybe that's the way anthropology was in the 50s' 60's?  Dont' think so though...it's all about neturality she thinks, but that doesn't make sense to me.  She does not however that L-S conceived of his method after reading Lowie...</p>
<p>Then she says something strangely put but probably true, that his ideas are closer to ""the more avante-garde methodologies of economics, neurology, linguistics, and game theory.""  (75-76) Avante-garde, in what sense?  L-S she says sees linguistics as a kind of ""natural science"" that will finally allow social scientists to transalt etheir science into a pure science...so she writes: ""...the man who submits himself to the exotic to confirm his own inner alienation as an urban intellectual ends by aiming to vanquish his subject by translating it into a purely formal code....The anthropologists, as a man, is engaged in saving his own soul. But he is also committed to recording and understanding his subject by a very high-powered mode of formal analysis--which obliterates all traces of of his personal experience and truly effaces the human features of his subject, a given primitive society."" (77) L-s calls this ""anecodotique geometrique.""  Structure is the ""broom"" she says that performing a great cleansing operation.  He's applying a ridid formalism to the analysis of non-western peoples.</p>
<p>She notes that L-S distinguishes his structuralism from the naturalistic British fucntionalism which in Sontag's words ""interprets the variety of custom as different strategies for producing universal social ends."" (78)  For L-S, she says anthropology can be neither descriptive nor inductive...""occupies itsself only with the formal features that differentiate one society from another."" (78)</p>
<p>Re kinship, e.g., the fucntionalists see kinship as rooted in biological relations [true?], but L-S, along with Boas and Lowie, see kinship as an artificial construction.</p>
<p>She ends by comparing L-S with Saartre, with whom she has compared L-S as one of the most powerful and influential thinkers in France.  She ntoes that she is not totally convinced by L-S critique of Saartre in Le pensee sauvage, last chapter.  But they are different.  Saartre is moved by Jean Genet above all, but Genet is all artifice and ""masturbatory revel.""  She links L-S to a different french tradition: ""the cult of aloofness, <em>l'esprit geometrique.</em>""  She says this tradition can be found innovelists like Nathalie Sarraute, Alain Robbe-Grillet, and Micahel Butor who seeks ""infinence precision"" and have ""narrow dehydrated matter and cool microscopic styles"".  She also mentions filmmakers like Alain Renais.  She says this tradition mixes ""pathos and coldness."" (79)</p>
<p>But she say a good critique of L-S must look at his formalism as a moral choice.  Now she is good here, so I will quote t length:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...his extreme formalism is a moral choice, and (more suprisingly) a vision of social perfection.  Radically anti-historicist, he refuses to differentiate between 'primitive' and 'historical' societies.  Primitives have a history; but it is unknown to us.  And historical consciousness (which they do not have), he argues in the attack on Saartre, is not a privileged mode of consciosness.  There are only what he calls 'hot' and 'cold' societies.  The hot societies are the modern ones, driven by the demons of historical progress.  The cold socieites are the primitive ones, static, crystalline, harmonious.  Utopia, for Levi-Strauss, would be a great lowering of the historical temperature.  In his auguarl lecture at the College de France, Levi-STrauss outlined a post-Marxist vision of freedom in whcih man would finally be freed from the obligation to progress, and from 'the age-old curse which force it to enslave men in order to make progress possible.'  Then:...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now she quotes L-S:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...[then] history would henceforth be quite alone, and society, placed outside and above history, would once again be able to assume that regular and quasi-crystalline structure whcih, the best-preserved primitive societies teach us, is not contradcitory to humanity.  It is in this admittedly Utopian view that social anthropology would find its highest justification, since the forms of life and thought which it studies would no longer be of mere historic and comparative interest.  They would correspond to a permanent possibilty for man, over whcih socail anthropology would have a mission to stand watch, especially in man's darkest hours.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wow!</p>
<p>She ends this essay, saying that ""the anthropologist"" is enacting a ""modern pessmism""...</p>
<p>NOtes:</p>
<p>One obvious and significant thing is that structural anthropology is nto all anthropology, and the Boasians, e.g., were not merely data mongers. Their was something more there...</p>
<p>But is this something that I could use in my Conclusion?  My original idea was that I could do the old invoke and the differentiate from, but that was in my memory of it and focused on that idea of the modern self seeking its ""oblviion"" in the other.  That's not quite what's going on here is it?</p>
<p>L-S and structural anthropology as she sees it is after a kind of permanence and stability...a kind of spatial-structural crystalline strength (presumably built around the right ideas) that would serve as  a defense against the destructive and horrrible effects of history (WWI and II, is obviously in the background here though she doesn't mention it...)</p>
<p>Perhaps that's what Sapir was after too...he's after-all the closest thing to a structuralist, with his focus on languag, but his sense of language was still humanistic (language followed grooves in the mind, not structures... as he says in his book on<em> Language</em>).</p>
<p>The thing to ask, given my thesis, is where's the individual in this?  It's gone...but was it ever that important for L-S given that, as Sontag also notes L-S thinking, he is an anti-Durkheimian but also in that line of thought... So... I could use this article as a way to work backward through all these flawed ideas about what Am. Anth was to what I think it is...</p>

The American Woman's Pre-World War I Freedom in Manners and Morals,"p. 318 -   Desc. of Moral Change & Individualization

The sociological origin of the notion of moral change that McGovern deploys here ought not to be ignored, and also dates to the period he is studying, a fact that McGovern does not really take into account. 

His description is on 318-319.  It has to do with a ""deterioration of external controls over morality"" which he says occurs before 1920.  That deterioration was the result of, he says, the ""dissolution of moral authority,which formerly had centered in the family and the small community."" (318-9)  I.e. it had to do with urbanization and the inapplicability of ""family values"" and instiutions to urban life.  ""As against primary controls and contacts based on face-to-face association where the norms of family, church, and small community, usually reinforcing each other, could be internalized, the city made for a type of 'individualization' through its distant, casual, specialized, and transient clusters of secondary associations."".  You can see th eorigins of this sociological argument in his f.n. at the end of the previous sentence.  He cites Soctt Nearing and nellie M.S. Nearing, ""Woman and Social Progress"" (New York, 1912) and of course W.I. Thomas's The Unadjusted Girl: With Cases and Standpoint for Behavior Analysis (Boston, 1923).  and Ernest R. Mowrer, Family Disorganization (Chicago, 1927).

McGovern also refers to this as ""individualization"".  (319)  I feel it is a bit reactionary.  McGovern, for instance, has a quote on 320 which seems extereme (and which would lead naturally to Lash's Haven in a Heartless World): ""Individualizaiton of members served to disrupt confidence between generations of the family, if not to threaten parents with the role of anachronistic irrelevance."" (320)"
The Categories,"<p>Notes</p>
<p>Part I -- he defines his categories.</p>
<p>* What's a category?&nbsp; He says it's an ""element of phenomena of the first rank of generality.""&nbsp; He thinks this def'n holds for Aristotle, Kant, and Hegel.&nbsp; (179)&nbsp; Then categories are borken down into two types: 1) Universal, which belong to all phenomena, although maybe to a greater or lesser extent in each case; 2) particular, which ""form a series, or a set of series, only on of each series being present, or at least predominatn in any one phenomenon."" (179)</p>
<p>His categoreis:</p>
<p>1) Presentness or just pure quality.&nbsp; He says Hegel was almost right witih his word Immediacy, but he was wrong in imaginging it to be ssomething abstract and that the concerete blinded one to the abstract.&nbsp; For Peirce presentness as an abstract ""cannot be <em>abstracted</em>."" (180)&nbsp; He says just go outside ""under the bloue doem of heaven aand look at what is present as it appears ot the artists' eye."" (180)&nbsp; The ""abstracted is what the concerete, which gives it what ever being ith as, makes it to be."" (180)&nbsp; The present he says can be understood by imagining a ""consciousness in which there is no comparison, no relation, no recognized multiplicity...no change, no imagination of any modification of what is postiively there,&nbsp; no reflexion--nothign but a simple postiive character."" (180)</p>
<p>[What is pragmatic here?&nbsp; Perhaps this critique of Hegel's understanding of abstraction...the abstractness of presence is simply the pure unmodified consciousness of the thing in itself...as it is.&nbsp; This is also anti-Kantian, becaues he's thinking that we actually do perceive these things.]</p>
<p>2) Struggle ie relation/interaction.&nbsp; Here's where presenetneess is made more complex through interaction. He gives the example of a ladder hitting you&nbsp; on the head. You've resisted the ladder even if you think you've not.&nbsp; He defends this category as a universal category for most of the section.&nbsp; A key momvent, however, key to pragmatism, is on 186 re expereince.&nbsp; Here the notion of resistance/relation/interaction is related to the role of experience in correcting our false ideas:</p>
<p>""But without being longer roudn the bush, let us come to close quarters.&nbsp; Experience is our only teacher.&nbsp; Far be it fromme to uenunciate any doctrine of tabula rasa.&nbsp; For, as I said a few minutes ago, there manifestly is not one drop of principle in the whole vast reservoir of established scientific theory that has sprung from any other source thn the power of the mind to <em>originate </em>ideas that are true.&nbsp; But this power, for all it has accomplished, is so feeble that as ideas flrow from their springs in the soul, the truths are almost drwoned in a flood of false notions; and that which experience does is gradually, and by a sort of fractionation, to precipitate and filter off the false ideas, eliminating them and letting the turth pour on its mighty current."" ((186)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Then also on 187, the lessons of experience, give rise to the ego as he explains there.&nbsp; CF the description of self-consciousness in ""Questions Concerning Certain Faculties... ""</p>
<p>3) The lats one is harder...here he's arguign for the existence of non-mechanical causation in things...a kind of existince of general principles??</p>
<p>Part II</p>"
A Four-Fold Humanity: Margaret Mead and Psychological Types,"p.187-188  Desire for STable Temperament 

In quote from ""Summary Statement"" Mead writes ""There is no sex inheritance, there are only family lines, bequeathing ot their lineal descendants regardless of sex, one of two temperaments, a certain physical type and an adaptive body chemistry.  There are cultures which have stabilized temperament so completely all cultural forms proclaim it..."" (187)  

Here in those lines you can see this ideal of a ""stabilized temperament.""   Later Sulivan notes that elsewhere Mead had noted they had speculated on the ""circumstances by which multiple strains of inheritance could become sufficeintly characteristic of a populaiton so that that population could obtain a more or less recognizable coherence or stability."" (188)  And she had noted Europen attempts to ""maintain such 'culturally achieved balances' under the rubric of race and other similar attempts under the categories of caste, the important conclusion of this reasoning wa s that a given temperamental type could become a general characteristic of a populaiton and thereby influence the ethos or emotional tenor of its society..."" (188) 

This last is in an untitlted document that Sullivan is sure was written by Mead though it is not in her normal handwriting,  it is in Library of Congress S11:8."
"The Soul's Economy: Market Society and Selfhood in American Thought, 1820 - 1920","<p>p.016-26 Polticial Economy, Human Nature and Class Consicous politics</p>
<p>At the base of political economy was a new science of human nature.  A notion of universal human nature, rooted originally in Christian conceptions of the ""solitary soul."" (16)  These Christian conceptions provided a ""point of departure"" for the Enlightenment psychology of ""Reason."" (16)  An view of the individual as ""abstracted"" from social relations.  Yet Sklansky thinks that this social science took  heed of ""nurture,"" rather they undestood the human faculties of learning and self-improvement as the basis for a project of ""social engineering."" (16)</p>
<p>Good explanation of the basis of the view of human nature (16-18).  Key part of Sklansky's argument is his explanation of how this view was rooted in a sense of class conflict.  As he builds up his view of human nature, it ultimately leads from Reason through to conscience and then to ""interest"" or self-interest, and then to enlightened self-interest which is not the same as selfishness. (17-18).  This is all related to the idea that labor, not leisure, was the basic human condition (18, bottom).  And thus he finally points out that this view of political economy was one that was rooted in the view that labor underlay all economic value.  ""...the classical economists defined 'value' as an absolute magnitude or measure of the cost of producing goods, meaning on the most basic level the required expenditure of soical effort."" (19)  This was the ""natural price.""</p>
<p>Because they rooted value in natural price they became concerned with surplus value and ""[t]hey located the source of that critical surplus not in trade butin the social relations that emerged in the production of wealth, or class relations."" (19) So he sees Smith for instance as being interested in the relatoinship between one's work and one' sposition in society.  And he sees Smith's distinction of productive and unproductive classes as the basis for a revolutoinary critique of the aristocracy.  This in other words is the kind of critique that was eclipsed by later notions of the social self, which no longer concerned themselves with the root of autonomy in labor and productivity in the sense of a notion of value as being rooted in work...This mean in other words that they under stood trade as the exchange of labor, see 19, middle paragraph.</p>
<p>The end point of this though is that political economy encourages what he later calls the ""newly class-conscious politics of the Revolutionary Era.""  (28)  Because property ownership was the basis of political representation, the ""ideal of popular sovereignty therefore entailed a vsision of representative goernment as an arean of cometing class interests.""   Thus the early debates over popular sovereignty ""focused upon how to represent and reconcile different forms of property within a single state, as Charles A. Beard argued nearly a century ago."" (25)</p>
<p>So critics of the Constitution (antifederalists?) saw those lower orders not represented as facing ruin and James Madison meanwhil estated that ""Those who hold, and those who are without property, have every fromed distinct interest in society."" (quoted o 25, from Federalist No.10) Thus the basic task of the government was to regulate these opposing class-based interests accordingto Madison (25-26).</p>

The Clash of Civilizations?,"p.45 Confucian-Islamic connection main obstacle to Eastern cleaving to West.

The latin American and Eastern European countries can most easily redefine themselves in this western mode (45)

But those that can't ally themselves with eachother, develop miltiary and economoic power, and promove internal development: ""The most prominent form of this cooperation is the Confucian-Islamic connection that has emerged to challenge Western interests, values and power."" (45)

There is he says an arms race in East-Asia w/ China at the head.  He then speaks of a ""Confucian-Islam military connection..."" (47)  But he suggests this is unbalanced b/c the West he argues is disarming, non-proliferation, he sees as one of its characteristic civlization goals (45-46) and this marks the arms race in this stage, where one side is arming and the other disarming while trying ""not to balance but to limit and prevent that arms build-up while at the same time reducing its own military capabilities.""

"The Scientific Reaction Against Cultural Anthropology, 1917-1920","[Stocking's take on Boas Censure]
Stocking's take on the Censure of Boas at the Decemeber 1919 AA meeting in Cambridge is that it had to do mainly with conflicts between the Maya-Washington crowd and the Boasian cultural anthropologists.  He also describes it on p.273 as being about the relatoinship between anthropology and other disciploines but I don't htink this is really born out in his analysis (read again for this).
He gives a whole history of the conflict between these two groups that is immensely useful and which I will need to re-read for the Professionalism chapter (276-296), but also he points out in terms of the those who voted for and those who voted agianst (275-6)
The problem with his analysis I think is that he doesn't get what Boas is saying  in the letter, i.e. that his opposititon to scientists acting as spies has to do with the fact that scientists ought to be critiquing the function of the state, not serving it.  When Stocking analyzes the letter on 273-5, he doesn't quite get this."
The Clash of Civilizations?,"p.032 COMMENT: Evidence of his teological approach to history.

In the midst of discussing aftermath of the first Iraq War, Huntington explains why he thinks democracy is emerging in the middle east: ""Many Arab countries, in addition to the oil exporters, are reaching levels of economic and social development where autocratic forms of government become inappropriate and efforts to introduce democracy become stronger.  Some openings in Arab political systems have already occured."" (32)  That teleology is interesting--why should wealth not be suited to aristocracy??  He must explain this.  Though Huntington smartly points out that the beneficiaries of this trend have been ""islamist movements."" (32)"
"From Experts to Social Scientists: The American Anthropologists, 1929-1963","p.017-  Shift to University...and Localism

As anthropologists came into the university they came into closer contact with other social scientists of various sorts.  Anthropologists worked in universities with sociologist, psychologists, geographers, etc... 

Thus ""The specific content of ideas and the infleucnes of other branches of knowledge on anthropology as a discipline varied from university to university. This discipline of anthropology was the aggregate of a collection of local configurations of knowledge specific to the anthropologists who worked in various university departments."" (17)   See also Charles Camic article on localism in Social Sciences

Prio to 1930, also, Madden argues that ""anthropologists worked on a very small scale in American universities.  Most departments only had one or two full-time faculty members, and at many, if not most, universities, anthropologists did not have separate departments. "" (18)  This led to further problems ""preparing new experts in the four fields that comprised the anthropological body of knowledge."" (18) Madden insists that in many cases where anthropology was in the same dept. as sociology it was subordinate and the ""agenda of sociologists threatened to fragment th discipline of anthropology."" (18) 

Madden describes an ""implicit divisoin of labor"":

""Anthropologists at Harvard trained physical anthropologists and archaeologists.  Those at Columbia trained the cultural anthropologists.  Neither department coudl boast of a strong tradition in all four fields."".  (18)

Nonetheless power rested in the hands of the ""Boasians"": ""During the 1920s, boas's students from Columbia occupied most of the key positions in anthropology, including editorship of the <i>American Anthropologist</i> and the chairs of most graduate programs in anthropology, and the common educational background of these students provided what little organization what little organization the disicpline had.""

Anthropology and Antihumanism in Imperial Germany,"<p>p.048 [Adolf Bastian, subjectivity in G. Historicism] Adolf Bastian criticized German history saying it had usurped its position as the ""queen of sciences"" because it had become too sujective: He wrote in Ethnologie und Deschiche in ihren Beruhrungspunkten unter Bezugnahme auf Indien, vol. 2, Ideale Weltin in Wort und Bild (Berlin: Emil Felber, 1892), 21... ""Since history must constnatly orbit in narrow...circles around the center of its own national consicouness [Volksbewusstseins]--in that it thereby raises itself to a queen of the sciences because it comprehends naitonal life in its realizations--it can never escape subjectivity, niether in its subject matter nor in relation to the historian himself."" (quoted on 48). As Zimmerman sums it up: ""History was entrapped in subjectivity, both because it dealt with the national self and because it had necessarily to describe the subjective experiences of the period that it portrayed."" Bastian of course thought that Ethnology avoided that fault, so it was not just a supplement to culturla history it was a superior alternative. Bastian wrot also in Ethnologie, v.2 but p.27: ""Ethnology maintains a standpoint of pure objective observation, sharply distinguished from history, which cannot rid itself of a subjective coloraiton because even when kept freem from calculating or doctrinaire positions, it is nevertheless based on 'reserach into motives.'""</p>"
The Victorian Barmaid as Cultural Prototype,"<p>*  Bailey says that there's a lot about sexuality, but that most studies have focused on certain areas: ""the submerged histories of 'deviant' groups; the ideology of written texts; controversies over regulation; andindividual cases of that remarkable phenomeon, closet <em>hetero</em>sexuality."" (151)  What's missing he says is a look at the ""'middle' ground of sexualitym, not as another exclusive territory, but as an extensive ensemble of sites, practices, and occasions that mediate across the frontiers fo the putative public/private divide.""

<p>*  He posits a new category: parasexuality.  It is para in denoting something almost or beside or secondary as in paramedic he says but also in denoting the idea of protection as in parachute: ""Parasexuality then is sexuality that is deployed but contained, carefully channelled rather than fully discharged..."" (151)</p>
<p>* Sow hat is a parasexuality a modification of?  He indicates that it is the model built up around the ""language of discharge"" and the phallocentric model of sexuality sometimes referre to as the ""hydraulic model...in which sex is a limited but powerful energy system, a permatic economy whose force must always be either fully released orsuppressed, its prime expression being the male orgasm."" (152)  This model also entailed the objectification of women and has been examined in relation to the ""pathologies of scopophilia and fetishism..."" (152)</p>
<p>* So he further defines parasexuality at this point: ""Parasexuality identifies a significant historical initiative as a <em>managed</em> version of the fraught imperatives of release or suppression in orthodox bourgeois sexuality."" (152)  He notes that the idea of ""management"" is appropriate int he context of ""the increasingly rationalised operations of an emergent leisure industry in the nineteenth century..."" (152)  So the key distinction here from previous relationship to bourgeois sexuality ist hat parasexuality in pubcs, music halls and popular theatres is that ""sexuality was a natural resource rather than a natural enemy.  Thus while parasexuality was certainly a form of control, it started from a point of acknowledgement and accomodation rather than denial and punishment..."" (152)  A bit later he refers to parasexuality as a kind of ""normalisation of sexuality."" (152)  But it wa also an ""exercise in framed liminality orcontained license that constituted a reworking rather than a dismantling of hegemony."" (152)</p>
<p>*  Parasexualty was controversial and earned crtics.  These issues were debated by industry managers and its critics, but also explored in the every-day exchanges of participants. (152-153)</p>
<p>* The Barmaid: she is for the ""unreconstructed male"" an ""instant cue for the knowing smile,"" while for the feminist she is the ""classic token woman."" (153) The essay whill show that she has  a history one of whose important themes ""is her glamorous embodiment of a distinct form of modernity -- parasexuality."" (153)</p>
<p>The essay then proceeds in three sections he says: 1) barmaid in relation to the ""modernisation of the Victorian pub."" 2) The concept of glamour in relation to graphic ""texts"" of barmaid and ""what they suggest of male subjectivities in relationship to the barmaid."" 3) Consideration of thiese matters in relation to the ""material context"" of the barmaid.  4) Last sections ituations barmaids in relationship to othe female service workers and speculates upon the ""implications for sexuali politics in the critical years of the late Victorian period."" (153)</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>* Barmaid was the produt of a transformation of the ""urban public house"" when the tavern around the 1830s was rpalced by the ""gin palace with its dramatic innovations of scale, plan, management and style."" (153)  Whereas many old pubs were ""little morthan parlours or kitchens of private houses,"" the new pub was bigger and catered to a more anonymous urban crowd.  Importantly, sales were made ""across a bar counter which separated customers from the drink supply and made for a more efficient and secure operation."" (154)  The capacity was increased by getting rid of chairs and tables, which also ensured more rapid turnover in customers.  ""Any feeling of contestion was relieved by the upward spaciousness of high ceilings and the illusory roominess controved by the generous use of mirrors and plate glass..."" (154)  The barmaid was needed as staff but also as an ""allurement among its mirrors and mahogany, its brassware and coloured tile."" (154)</p>
<p>* Older alehouses had also had womenb, tu in many cases they were simly wives or daughters ""exploited as an extension of their domestic duties."" (154)  What made the barmaid distinct was partly the new context: ""she was not physically separated fromthe public by the novel device of the bar counter, part of the pub's duplication of the apparatus of the retail shop which formalised selling and begn that conversiton of its clientele from gues to customers.  The bar was now also a boundary or cordon sanitaire which kept the barmaid almost literally out of reach of the customer (or vice versa), and met the publican's new concern for respectability to protect his license and greater business investment in ta time of tighete licensing controls and reform hostility."" (154)</p>
<p>* But Bailiey notes ""if the romaning wanto of the alehouse had now become contianed with the closed territory of the serving era,"" her separation had also made her role ""more conspicuous and seductive."" (154)  The bar coutner was ""the visual as well as transactional focus of the pub-gin palace and provided a framing effect that gave it the dramatic properties of a stage... "" (154)  The theatrical quality Bailey notes was increased by the ""flaring quality of the new gas lighting and the reflectinos of the pub's numerous mirrors..."" (154)  The fact that she shared the stage with the commodties suggested that ""she herself might be an article for purchase and consumption."" (154)</p>
<p>* What was significant here Bailey says is not so much woman as sex object however, but ""the woman as bearer of <em>glamour</em>, arguably a distinctively mnodern visual property,  and central to parasexulity in its practice of managed arousal."" (156) Glamour is usually associated with 1930s Hollywood stars.  Film historians define it as ""alluring charm or fascination, often based on illusion, that transforms or glorifies a person or thing."" (156)  Even older usage in the nineteenth century by Sir Walter Scott denotes a ""magic or fictitious beauty."" (156)  The crucial point for Bailey in realtion to parasexuality: that ""[d]istance not only sustains and protects the magical property that is commonly recognised in glamour, but also heightens desire through the tension generated by the psearation fo the galmour object and the consummation of desire."" (156) Distance can be achieved in lots of ways: you can put as in Scott's usage your loved one on a pedestal I.e courtly love or you can look throug a shop window or on television or photography as we do now, but it was this distance afforded by the bar--its aspect as a stage that isolated teh barmaid and made her distant--that gave her the qualities of glamour. (156)</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>* Won't go through all Bailey's analyses here.  He first references Manet's barmaid clerk (famous painting) and discusses a reading of it by T.J. Clark which saw Manet's image that reeads it as a illsutratinof the disjunctions of modernityl...and the emptiness of the barmaids face as a example of alientation.  But then Bailey analyses more popular graphical representations and finds something very different.  In these images the man has penetrated behind the counter and is regarded appealingly by the barmaids.  Bailey's reading of these is too good to summarize here, but the point is ultimately that Clark's reading may not hold up for these other more popular representations which he thinks get at the reality a bit better: ""In this context, the beholder is less the voyeur or predator than the ultimate participant in a flattering drama of opportunity and incluesion in the press and rush of big city life.  Should we say that the vision of the avant garde is distrubing yet probalbly more accurate, while that of the more popular aesthetic is reassuring yet ultimately deceitful?  Maybe; but it shoudl be noted that whatever the element of fantasy and manipulation in the latter, there is a conserable grounding in reality.  It is the particular genius loci of the pub, as it was with the popular theatre and music hall, to be an intermediate institution that combines the properites of both public and private domains.  Its internal space is in part firmly ordered between the open and closed, but much of it remains negotiable, including that across the bar counter -- and from both sides.""

"The transformation of German Jewry, 1780-1840","<p>General Notes</p>
<p>Note Session 10/12: Reading very selectively. Trying to map out the newer literature on Bildung. Although this isn't the newest book, it seems to be well respected. Sorkin is Mosse's student I thin#David Sorkin, *The Transformation of German Jewry, 1780-1840* (New York: Oxford University Press, 1987)<br /><br />Note Session 10/12: Reading very selectively. Trying to map out the newer literature on Bildung. Although this isn't the newest book, it seems to be well respected. Sorkin is Mosse's student I think. This book is cited in the newer books that touch upon the subject of Bildung and the Jewish middle class that I have looked at so far, Hacohen's book about Popper, and Marion Kaplan's book on the making of the Jewish middle class.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Critical Note: I think that Sorkin's point of view has a lot to do with Mosse, who I think was his teacher. Interestingly, Dirk seems to think that Mosee's work is no good, that he his perpetuating the *Sonderweg* thesis because he tells a story of Bildung's decline. I am not sure that this decline narrative is not justified in fact, esp. vv the expeirence of Jews. But Dirk has also pointed to the Kocka book about Bildung, which seems important since Kocka is one of thsoe who has critiqued the *Sonderweg*.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />My sense is that Sorkin builds on Mosse but tells a more detailed and differentiated intellectual history, one that is in fact less fixated on the inevitability and all-ecompassing centrality of Germany ethnonationalist turn. <br /><br />&gt; It is also noteworth here that Sorkin is using ""community"" and sub-culture. The vision of as Rodgers put it ""little platoons of society""... <br /><br />## Intro<br /><br />* This is a study of ""German Jewry"" between 1780 and 1840. It takes off from a deisre to ""explain why the nature of the most visible Jewry in modern Europe remained essentially invisible to its own members and to subsequent genreations."" (3) <br /><br />* This group he says has attracted so much attentiuon because ""in its history all of the hallmarks of modernity seemed to have converged in their fullest and most volatile forms."" (3) <br /><br />* He describes German Jewry as being involved in a ""twofold revolution."" 1) ""a protracted process of political emancipation, a far-reaching social transformation, and a racial anti-Semitism which eventually achieved power."" (3) 2) an ""encounter with the surrounding culture [that] resulted in an intense culturla productivity rivaled in earlier Jewish history only by the symbioses of the Hellenistic period and the Golden Age in Spain."" (3)<br /><br />* Sorkin thinsk that the novelty and productivy of this group's twofold reovlution has meant that it has attracted a great deal of attention, and indeed it has served as a sort of model for WEstern European Jewish experience generally. (3)<br />&nbsp;<br />* His goal seems not to challenge paradigmatic status...but rather to note that in descriptions of thiis twofold revolution, there has been far greater attention paid to the intellectual/cultural side, and not to the social revolution. On the flip side, more recent studies that do focus on the social revolution, have ignored the cultural and intellectual dimensions. He will not. (So one can see this book as sitting in that moment of early cultural history, post-Wingspan, where there was a sense of the dissatisfaction with pure social histroy and a recognition of a need to dealwith the cultural and intellectual.)<br /><br />* The results of the exclusively cultural focus he thinks was to set up a literature that interpreted the meaning of ""assimilaiton"" as a kind of self-denial or loss of a distinctly Jewish culture. Sorkign points out that this ""definition of assimilation...is based on static, anachronistic categories."" (4) The nationalist saw the ""Jew"" as opposed to the ""German."" The religioninst opposed the ""Jew"" to the ""Christian."" And both of these points of interprettion saw ""emancipation"" as being ""based on an act of hopeless bad faith."" (4) That was so because whatever gains German Jews might achieve it would in their view always come at the cost of ""self-denial."" (4) It was hopeless because Germans would never assume Jews as equals. So emanciipation was thougth to involve self-dianial and self-hatred and in turn hatred of others. So these accounts created a kind of ""continuum between self-denial and anti-Semetism"" and so ""lilnked emancipation teleologically to the events of the twentieth century."" (4) <br /><br />* What Sorkin intends to do is to replace this kind of account with another that by focusing on the twofold revolution&nbsp; -- ie social and cultural tranformations -- will trace the emergence ""of a new ideal of man from the last decades of the eighteenth century until 1840."" (4)&nbsp; This new ideal was develooped by a ""new intellectual group"" who he calls the ""ideologues of emancipation"" who shaped an ideology ""in response to emanciaption"" that involved a ""radicalizing of the Hebrew Enlightenment, the *Haskala*, which had arisen from the disaffection of traditional rabbinic and new lay elites with an autonomous community deteriorating from extreme social differentiation."" (5) <br /><br />* The new ideal, he says, ""had a definite conviction that German Jewry was degenerate"" (5) but also argued that regeneration would require equal rights as a precondition. (5) Equal rights would permit a process of rengeration and that process would in the end ""lead to the formation of a new kind of Jew and a new kind of Jewish community based on its ideal of man."" (5) The Jewish middle class ""bourgeoisie"" created by the ""transformation of German society"" readily adopted that ideal, thought without conforming to the ideologues ivision of regneration. But it did use the ideal to ""shape a new kind of Jewish community--a public sphere and a public social world -- informed iwth a new ideal of man."" (5) That new community nd ideal of man, Sorkin argues, ""represnted a new form of Jewish identity"" (5) that ""rested heavily on borrowings from the majority culture: its ideal, the formationof the individaul, *Bildung*, acme from the German bourgeoisie of education (*Gebildeten*)."" (5) Jews saw this bourgeooise as their ""model for emulation and a target for integration."" (5) And, Sorkin says, ""[l]ooking at German society from the outside,"" the&nbsp; Jews treated the bourgeoisie as the ""culture of the majority soceity."" (5)<br /><br />* The key idea here in the Jewish community was that there was a quid pro quo: ""rights for regeneration, for the creation of a new Jewish identity took place under the auspeices of political emancipation."" (5) <br /><br />* That is key because the social fact that Jewish integration remained incomplete for over almost a century. And it remained so. Sorkin thinks that what he is calling the ""ideology of emancipation"" would have had little relevant if emancipation had occured quickly and if Jews had been accepted in to German society after rights were given, but they were not. Emanciption remained incomplete and integration partial. Btu this situation ""comprised the conditions for the ideology becoming the basisi&nbsp; of a new kind of identity."" (5) <br /><br />* The dientity that emerged, he says, was a ""subculture."" (5) And by that he mans a ""minority-group use of the majority culture that has two aspects..."" (6) Such a subcutlure is ""composed of elemnts of the majority culture"" but is at the same time totally ""distinct and functions as a self-contained system of ideas and symbols."" (6) SO H E IS OPERATING WITH A KIND OF CULTURE OCNCEPT HERE...&nbsp; but he states outright that for such a subcutlrue the ""boundaries seaprating the subjculture from the majority culture were shifting and permeable..."" but there were boudnaries he says. And he notes that there was a ""creative element"" wherein Jews ""appropriated"" certain ideas of the majority culture in a way that differed from other Germans ""if only in nuances, social weight, and its fuision with elements of Judaism."" (6) <br /><br />* A key component of this subculture were a set of ""secular fact ors--cultural, eonomic, demographic, social--which it utrnedinto the basis of a separate existence."" (6) This means that this community cannot be understood in any simple or static way as defined by either religion or nationality. ""The identity must be seen instead as the subculture of a minority gorup, the specifially German-Jewish."" (6) This German-Jewish culture remained, however, unassimilated. Intermarriage, conversion, or denial of connection with Jews was not a dominant expeirence. More penetrating, Sorkin notes that due tot he lack of assimilation a certain ""sense of indignity and furstration"" was central to the community's expeirence and an ""aspect of its solidarity."" (6) <br /><br />* To answer his initial quesiton,this identiy and subculture remained invisible to German-Jews because of the ideology of emancipation, which ""proclaimed the absence or imminent disappearance of the social and political bonds that had unified Jews in the autonomous community, because their existence would have vitiated the claim to emancipation. That new cultural, social and poitical bonds came to exist, adn taht they did so through the ideology of emancipation, was a paradox that the ideologues could not comprehend. They could neither recogniye nor acknowledge that their ideology, deisgned to foster integration, had become a basis of separation. The bourgeoisie ould not see that its acculturation made it not German but German-Jewish."" (7) <br /><br />* The way Sorkin explaisn this then is to say that the ""community's invisibility...resulted from the disparity between ideology and socail reality."" (7) To say this, allows him also to say that what was going on here was not self-denial but the fact that these German-Jews were not able to ""fully understand the nature of their nascent community..."" **So this is a story, he says, not of ""self-denail but of irony--the consequences of the discrepancy between German Jewry's actual and its imagined situation."" (7)**<br /><br />* It is also because of the fact&nbsp; that this community was invisible to its own menmbers and that they denied its existence that the earlier studies, which focused on the cultural side of the twofold revolution, took those pronouncements at face value and told a story of self-denial as the cost of emancipation. That interpretation has played a central role in subsequent formulations of Jewish identity, and he givse the example of Zionism, which it seems he is probably critiquing here...and trying to present other forms of identity. <br /><br />* VV culture he echoes his earlier hedging on the self-contained idea, apparently trying to say he uses the concept but not as a key frame: ""...I have attempted to treat culture as neither determined nor determinant, but as one structural factor among others in an overall process of historical development."" (7) He is not using an explicit theory, but has observed the ""culture played a role in the overall transformation of German Jewry"", which has meant that he had to pay attention to it but could also not ""treat it as the primary phenomenon or...reduce it to an epiphenomenon..."" (8) <br /><br />* His book though is structured around culture. The first half looks at the ""genesis of a cultural formation"" and the second looks at the ""historical role of that cultural formatioon.. ""(8) <br /><br />* Sorkin hopes that the book sheds some light on the German-Jewish question (ie why was it invisible and why wasit so culturally productive). But he also sees the book as useful for thinking about ""the afterlife of the German Enlightenment, the *Aufklärung*, in the culture of liberalism."" (8) It is useful here becasue the ideology of emancipation projected ""*Aufklärung* modes of thought well into the nineteenth century."" (8) He says that this ideology was at times ""clouded"" by neo-humanist and romantic ideas, but he seeems to see it as remaining true to that core tradition--whcih he thinks is still valuable? He also notes that the ""successors of the ideologues""--who?--still used the same ideas in the 20th century ""to generate new positions within the subculture..."" ie he seems to think it still valuable as a source of liberal ideas???&nbsp; Perhaps he and Hacohen are&nbsp; on the same page in this ??? <br /><br />&gt; Note: To what extent is Sorkin just projecting a kind of American vision of a fissured society, a kind of mixture of Madisonian democracy, and mid-1980s idenity politics/liberal political theory in the Walzerian frame? <br /><br /><br />##&nbsp; Conclusion<br /><br />&gt; It is in the conclusion it seems where Sorkin really takes up the issue of Bildung? Or at least, k. This book is cited in the newer books that touch upon the subject of Bildung and the Jewish middle class that I have looked at so far, Hacohen's book about Popper, and Marion Kaplan's book on the making of the Jewish middle class.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>"

From Physics to Ethnology,"<p>Notes 11/12/12:</p>
<p>&gt; Reading for Manifold Origins article. What was the influence of neo-Kantianism and psychophysics?</p>
<p>* Stocking is trying to make more subtle the account that has dominated the discussion of Boas' intellectual roots. He's working against the critique of Boas' developed by the subsequent generation of anthropologists that maligned Boas as an arch anti-evolutionist... He wants to focus on what happened to Boas on his trip to the Canadian Arctic. (135-137)</p>
<p>* He lays out a series of letters Boas' wrote to Jacobi in 1882 and 1883 where he describes his developing interests. In one letter from January 2, 1882, he says that he'd like to study ""the mechanism of the life of organisms and especially of peoples that is before my eyes."" (137) Already he states his intention to work on geography, and that he will ""leave psychophysics in peace, since it leads me too far afiield, even if I shoudl find an unusually rich field of work in science."" (137) Afield from ?? ""the life of organisms and especially of peoples..."" ? (137) Then he states his larger goal vv geography: ""to investigate the influence of the configuration of the land on the acquaintance of peopples with their neaer and far neighborhood."" (138) He thinks to be fruitful in thsi study he will need to make trips, and also to become acquainted with physiology and sociology. (138)</p>
<p>* Then in April 10, 1882, he's sent his *vita* to Jacobi. Here is where he states his feeling that he need to move away from his materilaist *Weltanschauung*. ""In the course of time, I became convinced that my previous materialistic *Weltanschauung*--for a phsyicsit a very understandable one--was untenable, and I gained thus a new standpoint which revaled to me the importance of studying the interaction between the organic and the inorganic, above all between the life of a people and their physical enviornment. Thus arose my plan to regard as my life's task the [following] investigation: How far may we consider the phenomena of organic life, and especially those of the psychic life, from a mechanistic ponit of view, and what conclusions can be drawn from such a consideration?""&nbsp; Here too he thinks he'll need a knowledge of other sciences: physiology, psychology, and sociology. And he's turned to the Eskimo for this reason, thinking that they are an ideal peopel to study the ""dependene of the migration of present-day Eskimo on the configuration and physical conditions of the land..."" (139)</p>
<p>* At this point Boas fails to get a scholarship at Johns Hopkins, and instead goes to Berlin where he meets Rudolf Virchow and Adolf Bastian. He there studies things like astronomical determination of location and cartography in order to prepare for ""scientific travel."" (139)</p>
<p>* In another letter of May 2, 1883, as his planning for his trip to the Arctic is coming ot an end, he writes again to Jacobi. Now he says his goal is to ""work [out] a physiological and psychological mechanics, if I may use that term."" (quotedon 139) He says he would begin with pscyhophysics. and has an exact outline of a book on that. But he thinks me must begin with ""geogrpahy, since that is the science that I have thoroughly learned."" (140) So he says he has ""slected a geographically perteinent problem -- the dependence of knowledge of the land, [a relatiopnship] whcih accoridngoit my knowledge to date of exiting material can probably be worked out."" (140) He said he chose the Eskinmo because they were a people living ""in the simples possible circumstances"" but there too he says ""conditions are much too complicated"" (140) Then he also says that the ""general study will be about the knolwedge of peoples have of the local geography, which will be followed by a pscyhological study about the casues for the limitations of the spreading of peoples."" (140)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Stocking says based on all this that Boas WAS NOT going to the Canadian Articie to examine the ""Eskimo perception of sea water"" or becasue he was interested purely in geography as has been charged in earlier works. (140)</p>
<p>* Stocking suggests as the proper context for understnaidn gBoas' motives what Charles Gillispie has cllaed the ""German 'syncretisimm' of 'the historicist spirit of romantic idaelism and the hairy philosophy of monistic materialism'..."" (140) He notes that Boas was raised on Schiller and Goethe but then began to feel ""some of the ambiguities and tensions of Gillispie's syncretism. (140)&nbsp; -- Stocking notes Boas' own statemnt that he had to develop a compromise between his interest in math an dphysics and an ""intesnive emotional itneret in the phenomena of the world"" in his Anthropologist's Credo. (140-141)</p>
<p>* Stocking suggests that ""in understanding Boas' later shift to ethnology"" it is important to realize that there was a big overlap between ethnolgocial and geopgraphical work in German historical geography. , esp followers of Karl Ritter who was the intellectual guide of Theobold Fischer who worked with Boas in the earlyl 1880s. Ritter ""focus was on the interaction of man and enviornment--the 'relationshio of all the phenomena oand forces of nature to the human race.'"" (141) He tried to formulate a law o migrations of primitive peoples which was part of a ""prevolutionary ethnology."" (141) Ritter also founded the Gesellschaft feur Erdkunde* in Berlin, and had intended to found an ethnological society. Bastian did that instead, founding hte *Berliner Gesellschaft fpeur Antrhopologie, Ethnologie, und Urgeschichte* in 1858. And Bastian, who was then head of the Gesllschaft feur Erdkunde, conceived of it as a branch of that society. (141)</p>
<p>* Stocking has a quote from a letter from Fischer to Boas on 1882 giving him advice. It's really rich. What seems to come out of it is a real emphasis on the unity of the development of physical geographical studies and of the grwoth of scientific knowledge. Heres' the really bizarre quote:</p>
<p>&gt; The natural scientist, to be sure, resists fromt he beginning tracing everywhere the connections with man. But in order for him to seek completely new conceptions, in order for new ideas to come to him in abundance, he msut become conscious of the fact that the unity of natural science, with its various branches mutually influencing and conditioning each other, and all together constituting the condtiions of nature which influence the life of humanity everywhere, will be restored on the surface of our planet."" It is indeed a pslendid remakr that Ritter once made, that geography is the secure foundation of study and teaching in physical and historical sciences.It is in geography in which both find themselves gain, [and] in this sense, the unity of science in general is restored in it."" (141-142)</p>
<p>What does this all mean?&nbsp; Stocking does not really interpret this all, except to say that there is an emphaisis on the ""holistic, affective understanding of the relationshp of man and the natural world..."" (142) But Fischer is saying something more here. He's saying that geography is the basis for relating human knowledge to the perception of the real world, yes, but also that in that it is the basis for re-unifying all human knowledge. That phrase is powerful that is through geography that the unity of natural science ""will be restored on the surface of our planet.""</p>
<p>* Boas work in physics and pscyho physics at the same time ""raised problem which also took him along path toward the study of man's interaction with the extenral world."" (142) In his doctoral dissertation, Boas had perforemd experiments that dealt with the absorption of light in samples of water. But at points the measurement depended on Boas' subjective judgement. This led Boas to ""the problem of thresholds below which differences in stimuli produced no perceptible sensory differnece and to the question of 'just noticeable differences' in sensory stimuli, both of where were central to Fechnerian psychophysics."" (142) Boas then writes six article during the year of hsi miltiary sericce on psychophysics, that cuulmiantes in a discussion of ""The Basic Tasks of Pscyhophysics"" (142) Stocking does not go into detail on these articles, saying that they were fairly in line with what the secondary lit says on psychophysics, but he says that the general cahter of Boas'statements indicate a concern with the situational factors that affect the experimenter's perecption, i.e. subjectiivty. ""More fundamentally, he suggested that various differences which traditinal psychophysics assumed to be *qualitative* (e.g. in the intesnsity of light) were in fact *qualitative*. On the basis of such arguments Boas called into question the very possiblity of all perceptions or of a general law governing the relationship of stimulus and perception."" (143)&nbsp; Later in 1939 he wrote that these experiments taugh t him that ""there are domains of our expeirence in which the concepts of quantity...with which [as a physicist] I was accustomed to operate, are not applicable."" (143)</p>
<p>* Appropriately, Stocking shifts to Boas' contact with neo-kantianism here. Since the end point, the idea that some domains of experience are not accessible to scientific knowledge is a deeply Kantian insight. He notes that in his April 1882 vita, Boas had indicated that he was spending much time with philosophy in the last 4 semesters at Kiel. He was under the influence of Benno Erdmann, a leading Kant scholar. Erdmann, Stocking says, ""was especially interested in problems of logic, epistemology, and pscyhology."" (143) Boas sent Erdmann his articles on pscyhophysics, and Erdmann evidently commented on them. Boas' close friend Rudolf Lehmann, was also involved in the neo-Kantian movement. And Boas studied Kant on his trip. (143)</p>
<p>* Having noted this influence, Stocking attempts a kind of interpretation that I don't find so compelling, although it's not bad. His turn away from his materialism, expressed in his letters to Jacobi indicates a desire to question his materialism, not a full rejection. His work in physics and psychophysics led him to a concern with subjectivity in experimental perception. Now Stocking adds his take on the Kantian influence: ""Kantian philosophy--which in this period was impelling a number of men to a realization that the interpretive activity of the human mind had a great deal to do with the chracater of the objects observed in the 'external' world--must have also impelled him to a consideration of epistemological problems."" (145) I.e. what Stocking is saying here is just that neo-Kantianism reinforced Boas' confrontation with the problem of subjectivity. But I'm not sure that Stocking has got right his little quick summary of the neo-Kantians. To be sure they were concerned with the interaction between subject and object, but it seems to me from what I've read that they were in fact seeking to redefine science as something that could account for both material and immaterial phenomena, and the interaction between them, by grounding perception in physiology. What we can now about the world is defined by physiology and pscyohology; what we cannot know is things-in-themeslves. My account here is also totally weak, but it's more than Stocking gets at... There's also the Theobold Fischer quote that sounds a lot like the Kuno Fischer, whom Liss says Boas' was influenced by in her *Cosmopolitan Imagination.* K.Fischer published these critiques of Kant in the *Journal of Specualtive Philosophy* that sound a bit lilke T. Fischer in terms of this world-historical growth of human scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>* Stocking's argument then about Baffin Island takes a very subtle form. All the above influences involve a kind of need to compromise between varied scientific interests, and compromise was ""based on an underlying epistemological concern which runs beyond the Arctic trip through all of Boas' early work"": namely, the tension between subjectivity/reflexivity and objectivity. (144)</p>
<p>Note: I would put this even more strongly: because Boas was perhaps seeing a possiblity for unity in knowledge; that was somehow fragmenting; and the reason for that had to do with the roblem of subjectivity. Perhaps the neo-kantians had the confidence that they could overcome the disunity of knowledge by taking subjectivity ""scientificcally"" into account in, say, the study of pscyhophysics, and in knowing the pshcyological and physiological basis of subjectivity, but they were a very divided camp, and Boas, as Stocking notes, had pushed back against their ability to quantify phenomena that were in his view essentialy qualitiative, so he may ahve been even more skeptical of that claim to unity. So he had the desire to unify knowledge, perhaps, but the growing sense that that was not possible. His anthropology, as Liss gets at, was a way to try to hold things together,i.e. hold the unity of knowledge together...but that wasn't working. I'm really taken by this idea though that is perhaps in both Fischer's of geography as the basis of a unified scientific human knowledge that would expand with knowledge and understanding of the physical world. Must go all the way back to&nbsp; A. Humboldt, but given here a very different configuration and contextual meaning? Is this really a thing,though? Need to go back to that K. Fischer article and follow it out. I bet this is also in FA Lange.</p>
<p>* Now Stocking turns ot the question of the impact of the trip to Baffin Island. He first distances himself from the idea that the field experience is for anthropologists perceived as a kind of spiritual converstion, and he wants to suggest that this may have influenced interpretations of the impact of that experience on Boas. (144-145)</p>
<p>* Stocking in an interesting paragraph on 147-148 that goes from a reference to Boas' relationship to his parents and a tendency to revolt against authority, to a discussion of his reactions to the Eskimo, to wehther or not he changed his point of view, suggests that Boas **did not** experience the kind of transformation that, for instance, Laura Bohannan describes in her interpsecitive account of the modern anthropolgoists' experience.&nbsp; Note: I agree that Boas did not change in the way Bohannan describes probably, but one thing I notice here is that Stocking puts this in terms of the idea that Boas' ""European identity"" was not shaken. He cites as evidence Boas' regularly stated desires to speak with someone sensible, and his revulssion to the Eskimo culture. What I notice though is that Stocking misses that Boas' ""European identity"" was already unstable because of his Jewish background, i.e. in what Liss gets at about Boas, but also waht Sorkin has described in general...</p>
<p>* Stocking then goes on to contradict this claim, after trotting out the Herzensbildung quote.&nbsp; That quote he says obviously reflected a change in attitude of the sort that then became very dominant in *The Mind of Primitive Man*. Stocking's point here is rather to give a more deflationary account of the transformation. He wants to say that what Boas was doing here was in fact reacting to a growing sense of alienation from Germany, rooted in his devotion of the politics of 1848 and his sense that in Germany h e would be unable to do work and speak out in a way consistent with his politics. In this connection, he brings up the antisemetism in Germany. And then he says that due to this Boas was attracted to the ""wholeness of a society in which one did one's work without complain and shared food as one shared deprivation; in which the rule of tradition was accepted without hypocritical pretense to superior rationality; in which the *Bildung* of the heart rather than of the mind was the measure of a person's worth."" (150) I think Stokcing puts a lot of words in Boas' mouth here.</p>
<p>* From here Stocking speculates that upon his return to Germany -- a year in which he, following the advice of T. Fischer, attempted to become a privat dozent based on his Baffin-Land text (the first he produced on the trip) and spent time working under Bastian with other young ethnologists -- that he transformed scientifically away from physics to ethnology. Stocking notes the influecne of Bastian, who was an ethnologist. Boas' ethnology Stocking says was like Bastian's a ""pscyhologial study"". He notes that Boas' in fact call it folk-pscyhology referring to it's comparative dimenions, a prhase that eferred to Bastian's work. And like Bastian's work comparative study of *Voelkergedanken* or ethnic *Weltanschauungen*, Boas' basic unity of observation was the psychic life of each *Volk* as an organic whole, and its analystica goal was to get behind the modifying action of geography or hsitory to the fundamental 'lelements of the character of a people,' whichh could then be treated comparatively. Like Bastian, although to a greater degree, Boas was disinclined to cast the development of fundamental ideas in evolutionary terms."" (152) That said, Stocking thinsk that Boas saw the relationhsip bewteen *Elementargedanken* and *Voelkergedanken* as being more complex than Basian. Specifically, he thinks that Boas was influenced by Bastian's ""conception of 'geographical provinces of cutlural similarities'"" and yet he was beginning to cut against such geographical determinism by ""weighting"" that perspective itth ""historical meaning, emaphsizing the process of diffusion which&nbsp; made the mythology of a given province such as 'inextricable mixture' of 'fundamental ideas.' Indeed, it is in this sense of the hiotoricity of ethnic phenonmena, which is not chractersitic of Bastian, that is the most notewrothy aspect of Boas' early ethnological theorizing."" (152)</p>
<p>NOte: This is good! Thsi is what I'm emphasziing, and which Liss has too. So this is firmly grounded in Boas' thought.</p>
<p>* Stocking says that the origins of the emaphsis on historicity may have come from Dilthey! ""whose attempt to free the historical sciences from the domination of the epistemological assumptions of positivistic natural science had appeared in 1883, and who had in the prceedig year assumed a chair at the University of Berlin."" (152) Stokcing says that Boas made it clear that dilthey had influence dhim in later comments and he speculates that it was during his eyar in Beriln that he may ahve read or even heard him speak. (152)</p>
<p>* Stocking also notes that this historical orientation may have developed from Boas experience in the Arctic. He notes that Boas did not find the simplicity that he'd hoped to in the Arctic among the Eskimo. Stocking quotes from not sure what here: ""...'the influence of geographical surroundings' was an 'extremely complex' matter which was affected by any number of 'pscyhological' factors, whcih in turn were influenced by hsitory. 'The longer I studied [after returning to Germany] the more I became convinced that the phenomena such as customs, traditions, and migrations are far too complex in their origin, as to enable us to study their pscyhological causes without a thorough knjowledge of their history'"" (153)&nbsp; (F.n. #27, shows these are letters to Powell and Bastian. The first is perhaps to Powell, 6/12/1887, and the second to Bastian 1/5/86)</p>
<p>* Stocking says it was in this context that Boas conceived of ethnographic projecst in the Pacific Northwest. He planned a whole project that Bastian rejected in January 1886.&nbsp; In spring 1886, he was finally qualified as a dozent, but was soon off to British Columbia. And Stocking says that here he was very interested in history. Quoting him: ""I considered it necessary to see a poeple among which hstorical facts are of greater iinfluence than the surroundings, and selcted for this purpose Northwest America."" (153)</p>
<p>Notes: What is strange in Stocking's language though is that he here then says ""indeed, the letter diaries of this trip indicate thiat his motives were by this time ethnological..."" (153) What does he mean by ethnologicalhere???&nbsp; Is this becasue he's taking for granted an endpoint in the form of ethnology he takes to be central to American anthropology? What is ethnology here?</p>
<p>* On hsis return to New York in early 1887, he accepts a postiion as a geographical editor at *Science*. Again on this weird thing about ""ethnology"" Stocking feels he needs to explain the fact that this was a geographical editorship away by saying onjce again that Boas' focus was ""ethnological."" (153-4)</p>
<p>* On 154-155, Stocking goes through Boas' key ""The Study of Geography"" in order to argue basically that Boas had turned toward an ""ethnological"" perspective, which Stocking associates with the description Boas gives of the historicist-romantic view. See esp the end of the paragarph on top of 155. Where he defines that article as ""essentially a justification--to physical scientists generally, and to himself--of the study of phenomena whose only unity was 'the connection in which they appear to the mind of the observer,' which could nto be subjected to quantitative deetermination or to law, but which could only be 'understood' historically."" (155)</p>
<p>Note: This sounds very phenomenological. Having just read Boring's A History of Experimental Pschology, and thinking of Stocking's use of the word *Weltanschauung* and given the known link to Fechner and Helmholtz, this sounds like Anschauung -- sense-perception mixed with what Helmholtz called unconscious inference -- mixed with Fechner pscyholgocial aesthetics also. So I see where Stocking is going here, but I think he jumps to quickly. It's also a bit mixed up. He's implying it seems that Boas was mixing old romantic-historicism with the new psychology, and taking only interest in the conjnection of phenomena in the mind of a people. Also is that Boas' phrase...the connection of things in the midn of the person?</p>
<p>Note: Also Stocking in analyzing this essay notes the separation of logical/aesthetic and affective desire. This is really the key point somehow, as it gets into that changing meaning of the aesthetic in the transformation of *Bildung*.</p>
<p>* From here, Stocking shows how Boas applied the same distinction between the impulse to generalize and the impusle ot focus on individualities to his critiques of museum organization. Then finally on 156-167 he pionts out that there was therefore no conversion experience but instead a ""gradual and continous"" development ""out of his family and cultural background, his work in physics and psychophysics, his geographical interests, his contact with German Romantic idealist and historical traditions,a nd his work with Bastian, all inthe context of his feild of experience. In short, it flowed from his total life experience."" (157)</p>
<p>* The culmination of this point of view he thinks was in the 1888 article ""On Alternating Sounds."" This article he thinks brought together all the strands just mentioned above. His analysis is on 157-159. The concerns of pscyhophysics are brought together with culture.</p>
<p>*Stocking then ends on a note that destabilizees his claims a bit because he shows quotes where Boas is talking about wantig to find the ""pscyhological origin of the implicit belief in the authority of tradition"" and he cites that 1887 review of Bastian's book where Boas hits this note.</p>

Ruth Benedict and the Modernist Sensibility,"<p>p.139-139 B against ""modernist self-doubt""?</p>
<p>Here H says that ""[i]n <em>Patterns of Culture</em>, Benedict discovered the authentic, holisitc cultures she sought nd from whichthe modern world had xcluded her as a participant."" (139)  Then H notes that B perhaps accepts even those cultures that repress individual expression because it does not seem to be done coercively?  [Note: But the whole role of culture itself is coercive in the way she describes it...it molds plastic people...] H thinks B rejected Sapir's ""genuine culture"" model resting on ""sincerity"" because ""sincerity implies self-consciousnss, and Benedict sought worlds in which meaniningfulness and participation could exist wihtout such awareness.  The Northwest Coast potlacher could pursue megalomaniacal successes unhindered by modernist self-doubt."" (139)</p>
<p>then...""Benedict wrote into being the holisitic, enuine cultures that no longer existed in the modernist's world. At the same time, she preserved her own indivduality, controlling and inviolate as a narrrative voice..."" (139)</p>"
Ideas and Institutions in American Anthropology: Thoughts Toward a History of the Interwar Years,"<p>[3] [On Boas' ""Experiential Standpoint""] Stocking has a statement here that coincides with my ideas:  the idea that the Boas' critique grew out of a distinct perspective formed by a kind of outsiders position.  This outsider position was defined by the influence of the neo-Kanitan German philosophers (and that Germano-Romantic tradition of thiought), his ""cultural marginality"" as a German-Jew, and his early professional alienation...  Two things about this.   1) It seems similar to my attempt to describe the Boasian point of view in the first chapter as the emergence of a distinct ""point of view"" and one that grew out of the alienated position of the discipline... Stocking however describes the above factors as causing an ""experiental standpoint from which a systematic critique could be developed."" (3)   2) Stocking's descriptions also highlight the point for the second chapter which is that this position of marginality is also about a larger cultural conflict between the positivistic and the historical intellectual tradition... (3) E.g. Stocking writes ""For those who felt no serious alienation from the machine-driven civilization celebrated at the universal exhibition, there was apparent reason enough for such an assumption [i.e. the assumptions of Social Darwinism that Stocking pointed out attempted to legitimate the already assumed notion of cultural superiority of European civilization].  But Boas' cultural marginality as Jewish German, his early fiedl experieince, and his difficulties establishing himself professsionally in the United States helped to create an experiential standpoint from which a systmatic critique could be developed.""

"Verging on Etra-Vagance: Anthropology, Hisotry, Religion, Literature, Arts...Showbiz","(6) p. 30 - 38 Mead's ""Subjectivity""

In two sections here Boon basically examines the treatment of menstruation in Benedict, Mead and Belo,
showing how the three built up their statements on this
theme.  Finally, he shows how Belo built in Mead's statements about a dance ritual in Bali in a text that Benedict read the year she died and allegedly approved of -- the point being that Belo inserted Mead as a counter-point to her own conclusions about the ritual and what it said about gendered female identity...  This mode of citing he sees as something like his ultra-objectivity.  ""...it is critical to note that Belo cites Mead's 'objective' description interrupted by Mead's own 'subjective' commeon on Balinese women's witch-likeness.  But before Belo returns to the next day of her own description of eight months beforehand (Sindoe, April 27, 1937), she interjects a dissenting commentary on Mead's description plus comment.  I reiterate: Belo interrupts Mead's own self-interrupting notes--notes that Belo had use to interrupt her own 'notes' that form the bulk of her study's evidence....""  (38) The analysis that Belo than provides Boon describes as ""arresting""...she describes Mead's sense of the daggers that the women use to stab themselves as ""between a phallus and a baby."" (38) and her statement that Mead seems to see something evil withc-like in the ritual whereas she doesn't.   and on the next page then Boon states: ""I kinow no more powerful insight into a 'subjectivity' possibly guiding Mead's endeavors overall--in Samoa, Manus, Omaha, New Guinea, Bali--than Belo's critical insight."
A Manifesto for Feminine Modernism: Dorothy Richardson's Pilgrimage,"<p>Quick Notes 7/5/10</p>
<p>F<span style=""text-decoration: line-through;"">e</span>lber sees in the writer Dorothy Richardson's thirteen volume <em>Pilgrimage</em> , a work produced between 1915-1967, a femine modernism that exhibits modernist characteristics <em>and</em> takes up (in thew ords of Rita FElski) ""takes up feminist concerns: if, for example, the text seeks to undermine an obviously patriarchal ideological position."" (25)  This is what Felbert thinks Ricahrdson's text does by rejecting male-patriarchal logocentric writing techniques.</p>
<p>A couple of example that came through on my quick reading of this article</p>
<p>1) She gives an example right of the bat by saying that Richardson pursued an aesthetic that ""privileges writing which is nonhierarchical and flowing..."" (25)  Felbert notes that this is indicated in her formal choice of a sequence novel or <em>roman-fleuve</em>, which apparently literally means ""river novel,""  This puts Ricahrdson in the zone of ""stream-of-consciousness,"" but Felbert notes that Richardson dislikes that phrase.  She calls it instead ""shroud of consciousness"": <em>""Her objection is elucidated as she explains that 'stream of consciousness is a muddle-head phrase.  I'ts not a stream, it's a pool, a sea, an ocean.  It has depth and greater depth adn when you think you have reached its bottom and there is nothing there, and when you give yourself up to one current, you are suddenly possessed by another.'  She rejects 'stream of consciousness' as too restrictive both in its unidirectional flow, bounded by its banks, and in its forward-moving linearity.  In contrast with the bounded male language, Richardson advocates a 'feminine prose,' which she defines in the introduction to Pilgrimage as 'unpunctuated, moving from point to point without formal obstructions.'"" (25)</em></p>
<p>2) On 28-29, Felber develops this rejection of the boundedness of male langauge in Richardson's preference for silence as a rejection of male logocentrism.  In fact, this ties to an earlier point in whihc the ""internal"" is a kind of feminine world that cannot be adequately expressed in the ""external"" langauge of men (or that language as it has been defined by men, thus creating the need for a new kind of feminine writing, 26-27.  [Note: it's interesting to think in relation to this of Simmel's arguments about ""objective"" culture as being a mascuine thing and ""subjective culture"" as being feminine.  This is essentially the same argument it seems?]</p>
<p>3) The new method of writing it seems is found in Pilgrimage by the main character Miriam when Miriam encounters a new wrigin stile in one of hte other characters named Amabel.  The two see in eahc other ""qualities no man cn see."" (31, elber's words.)  Miriam encounters this in a letter from Amabel, which provokes an ""aeshetic revelation.""  (32)  It's the cahracter of the hand-writing in part whcih ""evokes the writer's presence"" as well as evoking the ""female ibody in the manner advocated by the French feminists: 'Each word, eaech letter, was Amabel, was one of the many poses of her body, upright as a plant is upright, elegant as a decorative plant, support its embellishing cuves just as th eclean uprights of the letters supported the curves that belong to them.'""  (32)  So Felber says that the letter becaomes an example of <em>""ecriture feminine"" </em>and of modernist narrative coming together.  Longer quote on 32-33 illustrates the coming together and othe rmodernist qualities.  The idea of words as hieroglyphs...gaps between letters etc etc. ""...the writing is spatial and synchronous, creating a picture, transcending the bound quality of male wriing which moves 'from word to word.'"" (Felber, 33).  Miriam responds to the ltter in a way that Felber says ""makes clear tha the letter represents a new gendreed tradition in writing:</p>
<p>""Instead of calling her attention to the way the pen was held, to the many expressivenesses of a given handwriing, apart from what it was being used to express, instead of bringing as did the majority of letters, expecially those written by men, a picture of the writer seated and thoughtfully using a medium of communication, recognizing its limiations and remaining docile within them so that the letter itself seemed quite as much to express the impossibility as the possiblity of exchange by any means of the written word, it called her directly to the girl herself, making her, and not the letter, the medium of expression."" (34)</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Felber ends the essay by saying that ""Miriam disocvers how to articulate her true essence and write in an inherently feminine style.""  This in turn allows her to ""transcend the impasse of the binary opposition of speech-silence: She has discovered a language which speaks a silence and feminine essence, an laternative language to the restrictive male discourse."" (35) She quotes Irigary as saying that a feminine language would be one in which ""every dichotomizing--and ta the same time redoubling--break, including the one between enunciation and utterance has to be disrupted."" (from <em>Power of Discousrse</em>, 79-80, her on 35.)  Ricahrdson's work Felber says anticipates ""the so-called French feminist position."" (35)  She anticipates critiques that would suggest that by saying that such writing celebrates essential female qualities and in this way suports essentialism is wrong.  Here she says: ""femininity is valorized to emphasize the absurdity of the traditional denigration of qualities attributed to women.""

Ruth Benedict and the Modernist Sensibility,"p.135 Contradition in Benedict's Approach to Culture

Handler says that Benedict in her dissertation issues a ""programmatic call to her colleagues to reorient field research in order to document the patterns of particualr cultures (Benedict 1932:7)"".  (135)  

This call he contrasts with the position Sapir took in ""Unconscious Patterning..."" that observers of other cultures are likely to get the meaning of a ritual wrong. (134-5) See original article 546-547 for Sapir quote.  The ability of the anthropologist to describe such patterns, Handler says, was never in doubt for Benedict. (135)  

Handler says, though, that there was a contradiction.  Citing Boon's Verging on Extra-Vagance he says her ""method is fundamentally comparative and hermeneutic.  It thus implies the impossibility of objective descriptions of individual cultures--or, more precisely, of descriptions constructed by an observer occupying neutral ground."" (135)"
Another Liberalism: Romanticism and the Reconstruction of Liberal Thought,"<p>Notes Spring 2011:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Introduction</p>
<p>She's trying to capture an aesthetic or affective response to liberalism  by romantics. &nbsp;She thinks there are elements in liberalism that appeal  to romantics. &nbsp;She thinks romanticism might be the return of the  repressed. &nbsp;She describes how romantics see liberalism--as cold and  rational. &nbsp;She looks at romantic individuals who think liberalism can be  redeemed, and vice versa. &nbsp;Her own context is the 60s and 70s attacks  on liberalism, and seeing it as being resilient and adaptable.</p>
<p>2. Ch.1&nbsp; Romantic Militarism versus Civil Society</p>
<p>* Romantic militarism poses a threat to liberalism because ""[l]iberalism stands for, among other things, security of expectations, civilianism, and peace.""&nbsp; (9)&nbsp; Romantic militarism contrasts because it holds out ""romantic dreams"" and a tendency to ""imagin[e] war as the prime occasion for perfect freedom and self-expression."" (9)&nbsp; Romantic militarism disregards the military as a bureaucracy ""marked by coercion, obediance, and routine."" (9)</p>
<p>*&nbsp; But it's not only about ""opposition"" because romantic miltiarism can also ""appear as a series of exuberant variations on liberal themes."" (10)</p>
<p>1) For romantics whose ""formative experience"" was French Revolution, liberalism was a revolutionary doctrine.&nbsp; And for them romantic militarism was ""perpetual insurrection"" that did not end in the creation of a new establishment.&nbsp; Here ""Romantic militarism is an exaggerated echo of a fundamental liberal dilemma--that the ideal of personal freedom can never be fully encompassed by any catalogue of rights and benefits and will always be frustrated by the actualities of even limited government."" (10)</p>
<p>2) Romantic miltiarism as opposed to civil society takes asserts a ""heroic indvidualism"" and in this form it ""exploits liberal ideas.""&nbsp; It accepts the emphasis on the individual, but jettisons the ""moderate"" understanding of the individual as driven by prosaic ambitions.&nbsp; It replaces ""moral autonomy with amoral expressivism."" (10)</p>
<p>* She uses Wordsworth's ""Convention of Cintra"" to illustrate romantic militarism that leads to a desire for revolutionary liberation.&nbsp; The title is from the armistice the British and French signed to put an end to their conflict in Iberia. For Wordsworth, the war satisfied a desrie for action that would satisfied intense human desires.&nbsp; So as he sees it ""an expedient act of state is transformed into an expression of genius."" (11)&nbsp; What Wordsworth particularly liked was that even after the convention was signed the British and Spanish were ""inspired"" to fight on--that inspiration was an ""intangible"" and ""spontaneous"" force. But Wordsworth's story has a complex relationship to liberalism.&nbsp; Rosenblum thinks Wordswroth's ""Convention"" was not--though it could be read this way--a republican warning of the loss of virtue that can occur if a people don't experience threats from without, and thus a part of that civic humanist tradition that saw war as a way to avoid corruption.&nbsp; (12)&nbsp; It was for him about ""intensity of desire"".&nbsp; (12)&nbsp; BUT Rosenblum says that ""even when inspired, Wordsworth's people preserve the ethos of liberalism. They are r enthusiasm for private individuals united in their enthusiasm for liberty."" (12)&nbsp; So his idealized people she says ""are suspicious of government and opposed to tyranny, a nation of men and not citizens..."" (13)&nbsp; So Wordsworth wants his people as R puts it wewll to ""love independence, not to use it.""&nbsp; (13)&nbsp; Wordsworth's version of romantic militarism she says is born of combination of French Revolution, nationalist wars of independence, and the British state which was <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">not</span> centralized or marked by an adminsttrative zeal.</p>
<p>*&nbsp; She turns to Humboldt whose vision of miltiarism did grew out of the political expeirence of a centralized bureacuratic state.&nbsp; Therefore ""Humboldt is more scrupulous about insulating individuals from government and less sanguine about their capacity for genius.""&nbsp; (14)&nbsp; Humboldt sees all modern states as ""enlightened despotisms"" and he views their administrative efficiency as a force that enervates ""the free play of personal energies and homogenize individual differences."" (14) ""German efficiency"" causes Humboldt to celebrate citizen-soliders cultivating individuality in war--and so he regrets the dissapearance of war.&nbsp; But Humboldt is also realistic and he knows that in fact soldiering for the modern state involves some of the most intense forms of homogenization.&nbsp; So ultimately ""Humboldt resigns himself to the view that individuality and spontaneity must be cultivated privately, apart from war."" (16)&nbsp;<strong> In doing so, R states that Humboldt ""charts a course back to liberalism that will be taken by other romantic sensibilities, moving from the exhuberant dream of heroism to a stern recommendation of private life under limited government. He reconciles himself to legalism and to the pacific private sphere liberalism provides."" (16) </strong>His <em>The Sphere and Duties of Government</em> she says is the prodcut of this ""odyssey"".&nbsp; And in it H presents a theory of the liberal ""nightwatchman state""--a small govenrment that simply ""provides seecurity against external enemies and a framework of laws to regulate conflict."" (16)&nbsp; It leave the ""inner person alone.""&nbsp; (16)&nbsp; In this way, R notes ""[l]imited government and private liberty are transformed into conditions for the development of beautiful individuality."" (17)</p>
<p>* Another romantic reaction to liberalism was the push toward ""heroism.""&nbsp; Heroism was a response to the move, associated with liberalism, away from ""passion"" to ""interest""--the gradual replacement of the chivalric tradition and the aristocratic ideal of military service with a focus on commercial ""interest."" (18)&nbsp; R cites Albert O. Hirschman's <em>The Passions and the Intrests</em> as presenting one version of this narrative.&nbsp; In this narrative, commerical economies were justified because ""money-making activities were rational and benign comparedwith disruptive military service."" (18) The reaction to this was one that resurrected ""heroism"" as an attack on ""economic man.""&nbsp; There were different attacks from this angle: repubilcan advocates of civic virtue saw the ""military ethos and personal courage"" as resistant to corruption and the anciem regime equated heroism with aristocratic honor and nobility and advocated the aristocracy's returnt o power as a ""recover natioanl glory."" (18)&nbsp; <strong>Romantic heroism</strong> was differnet because it had no ""concrete and social content""; in fact, it was appealing precisely because it mean ""just one thing: unconstrained self-assertion."" (19)&nbsp; ""Unlike republican courage and aristocratic service, romantic heroism is opposed not to egoism, but to then arrow selfishness of commerical types."" (19)&nbsp; H notes that the appeal of heroic self assertion is that it ""offers proof"" of the indivdiual's ""inner sense of limitless power."" (19) Napolean is the model for e.g Alfred de Vigny. (19-20)&nbsp; <strong>Here too R finds a route back to liberalism: ""a romanticism that identifies personal dignity with independence, and independence with extraordinary action, is not as remote from liberal individualism as might seem.&nbsp; After all, classical liberal thought describes an individualism for the strong.&nbsp; This is especially true of Locke and Kant, for whom enlightenment requires 'heroic' action, the throwing off of priestly and political authorities and striving for personal independence.&nbsp; Autonomy demands struggle against tyrrannies on every front and against ingrained habits and prejudices.&nbsp; Enlightenment is soemthing that can only be done by oneself, not by or for others.&nbsp; Individuals are not simple beneficiaries of liberty, then, but aggressive personalities who need to assert themselves to win it in the first place."" (21)--though R qualifies saying this that liberalism doesn't have the exlusive meanign of being for the strong, and is not so explicitly masuline.&nbsp; Althought it was historically linked to men, ""there is no conceptual barrier to extending [its rights] to women."" (21)&nbsp; And liberalism does always entail ""respect for others"" -- a ""minimum of utiltiarian attention to the general happiness."" (21) </strong></p>
<p>* Romantics may also simply ""feel aversion to prosaic civil society"" without indulging a ""compensatory"" stance like heroic self-assertion.&nbsp; She uses alfred de Vigny to illustrate; he ultimately advises ""stoic resignation."" (22-23).&nbsp; Then using Mill, who is open to romantic sensibilities and</p>
<p>Part II -- Liberalism and Romanticism at the Margins</p>
<p>ch.3 The Penumbra of Privacy</p>
<p>* another contrasting of liberalosm and romanticism: &nbsp;""The romantic is always on the verge of extreme privitization..."". It resists ""conventional engagements and constraints"" of public life and seeks detachment as a technique for ""self-development, self-expression, and artistic creation..."" (59). For liberals on the other hand, ""'private' refers to society..."", which is created by protecting society from governmentm with civil liberties. (59). &nbsp;Romantics are less concerned about limiting government's power. &nbsp;But after the ninetheenth century, these contrasts have lessened. &nbsp;As a result liberal ""rationales for private life have expanded and multiplied, sometimes appropriating romantic perspectives,the notion of private life has emerged as a critical idea on the margins."". (59-60).<br /><br />* Account of classical liberalism: &nbsp;separated public from private, as much to create an autonomous public realm as to create autonmous private realm (60), But the public realm had a responsibility to limit the power private groups exercised over individuals. &nbsp;Hence Madison's pluralism implied access to private groups as well as the capacity to exit. [Interesting re my description of Boas' cosmopolitanism...as requiring both] (60). Neither public or private groups should absorb the individual. At the same time, the individual has no social responsibility--that's why communitarians have critiqued it. &nbsp;Public authorities create a space in which the individual can pursue happiness, and so long as his actions remain lawful, the individual is not accountable for their consequences. (61) &nbsp;But this is not total anomie or pure individualism either. &nbsp;""Private life means life in civil society..."" (61). &nbsp; Liberalism makes possible group membership and group activities that have a public-political significance. &nbsp;So civil society is an ""array of 'partial publics'..."". (61). Hobbes and Locke believed that private liberty would promote public discussion and group membership. &nbsp;It would impact policu and form a ""bulwark against Bonapartism, mass politics, and totalitarianism."" (62) so R says classical liberalism provided ""'public' rationales for private life."" (63)<br /><br />* Free speech is valuable negatively because of ""suspicion of government's purpose"" etc, but also positively because of its benefits for civil society and its task of monitoring publlic authorities. &nbsp;(63).<br /><br />* liberalism evaluates speech in terms of its ability to rationally communicate therefore and not for self-expression. &nbsp;So attempts to expand free speech rights are not about whether kanguage is ""sincere"" or ""authentic."". (63). The idea that speech is itself good is not a liberal concept. &nbsp;For Rosenblum it is a mark of the ""vulnerability"" of liberalism to romantic ideals. &nbsp;(63)<br /><br />* But as time has gone on liberls have recognized that there is not only tension between individuals and government, but indeed between individuals and private associations, ie any organized group. &nbsp;So that the notion of private has started to be identidied with the personal-intimate. &nbsp;And: ""The conflict is no longr between official and unofficial obligations but between the demands of life in society and the felt imperatives of individuality and personal life."" (63). As a result then ""liberal privacy begins to converge with romantic notions of detachment."" (63)</p>

Iron Wall: Israel and the Arab World,"<p>Notes 10/2015:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shlaim is one of the key ""new"" revisionist historians. It's significant that this book starts with a statement of his father: ""The Jews prayed for a state of their own for two thousand years, and they prayed in vain; did it have to happen in my lifetime?!"" Then Shlaim writes in the following sentence: ""This book is dedicated to his memory."" (pg xvi).</p>
<p>I haven't read his whole account but it seems to me that this speaks volumes about his perspective: a one-rich Iraqi Jew, who lost the position that Jews held in Iraq, and blames that (why?) on Israel. He's rich nonetheless, and has the best education, landing him at Oxford.</p>
<p>The two prefaces are useful. The second, especially, because it traces some of the more recent developments with regard to the revisionist historians, in particular the split inside that group with Benny MOrris now placing more ""blame"" on the Arabs and the Palestinians. Shlaim disagrees with Morris, but he acknowledges in that summary that the revisionist historians now no longer agree among themselves. (xxiii)</p>
<p>With regard to the current book:</p>
<p>The point of his analysis in the book, he says, is to examine ""Israel's policy toward the Arab world."" (xxvi). The focus then is on Israel and Isareli thought and behavior.</p>
<p>## Prologue:</p>
<p>A good quick summary of the early zionist leaders: Herzl, Chaim Weizman, Jabotinsky, and Ben Gurion. He seems to like Jabotinsky the most, perhaps because he acknoweldged the problem, although he thinks that Jabotinsky's legacy has not been honored since he also wanted a settlement, and this part has been forgotten or avoided. Perhaps this is why he seems in particular to like Ben Gurion and Weizman who negotiated in a two-faced manner, courting the British and othe rpowers, whilst only appearing to seek a settlement with the Arabs. This is I think a theme of the book.</p>
<p>## 1. The Emergence of Israel</p>
<p>* He asks if the Israelis had an option other than dealing with King Abudullah of Jordan instead of negotiating with the Palestinians after acceptance of the UN Partition plan (UN resolution 181 from 29 Nov 1947). HIs answer is no! Becuase Hajj Amin al-Husseini had lead the Palestinian nationalist movement to an outright hostility toward Zionism that was as strong in the 1940s as it was in the 1930s. (30). This seems like a key moment in the book where he is willing to grant that Israelis were right to make an end run around the Palestianians. -- A rare moment probably.</p>
<p>* Talks about the ""popular-heroic-moralistic version of the 1948 war"" that is popular and widely taught in Israel. He then challenges it. (36), first by rejecting the idea that the Arabs always had a superior military power; this was not true. RAther, the opposite. Ultimately, Israel fielded more troops (36-37). Secondly, the Arab's war aims wer enot united in opposition to Israel, in a desire to destroy it; rather the Arab countries, and King Abudullah, all had their own aims. So he writes: ""Each of the other Arab states were also moved by dynaistic or national iterests, which were hidden behind the fig leaf of securing Palestine for the Palestinians. The inability fo the Arabs to coordinate their diplomatic and military plans was in no small measure responsible for the disaster that overwhelmed them."" (37).</p>
<p>* He faults the Israelis in the war after Egypt violated the UN armistice for gaining strategic ground outside the UN partition plans area alotted to Israel. (39).</p>
<p><em>[It's hard for me to understand in this account how he can blame the Israelis for gaining as much ground as they could. The Holocaust had just occurred; the age of imperial play in the region was not exactly over. He seems to judge them from a standard that at the time was yet to be established, and that today still i sunstable.]</em></p>

How 'Jewish' Was Theatre in Imperial Berlin,"<p>General Note 9/19/2013</p>
<p>Jelavich looks at the theatre culture of Imperial Berlin. It was not exclusively Jewish but there was considerable participation among Jews. Otto Brahm, e.g., had found ed the Freie Bühne, in Berlin in 1889. He wanted to put on shows that were free from censorship, so that he could stage ""potentially ontroversial"" modern plays like those of Ibsen and othe rmodenr playwrights. He organized the theatre as a private ""association"" in order to avoid the censors. But then teh question is how important was it that Brahm was Jewish since he was not staging explicitly ""Jewish"" plays?</p>
<p>The answer the Jelavich gives is that it was important, in part because Brahm's theatre was supported by a range of Jewish patrons. And even a police observer in 1894 noted that its vistors were mostly ""of Jewish elements."" (41) What was going on here? Was there something ""Jewish"" about the naturalist modern plays that Brahm wanted to stage? Jelavihc's answer is not in terms of content, but in terms of teh kinds of spaces that these Jews were hoping to create. Rather than trying to stage Jewish themes, or on the flip side, to participate in theatre in order to become respectable within the braoder German <em>Biludngsbürgertum, </em>Jelavich argues that what these people were doing was ""sponsoring a cultural space that explicitly fostered aesthetic pluralism and experimentation."" (42) And this Jelavich argues was these Jewish people's vision of liberalism: ""Having been subjected to discrimiatnion for so many geneartions, Berlin's Jews, like their coreligionists in other countries, had a vested interest in supporting a worldview that championed diversity of opinion in politics and in the arts."" (42)</p>
<p>Jelavich ties his argument to the Jewish relationship to the concept of Bildung, that was also changing in this period. Jewish emancipation he says had begun in the Napoleonic era and was completed with the Founding of the&nbsp; German Emprei in 1871. (42) Jewish people in Germany pursued Bildung. Jewish men were disproproraitonaly represented in the German <em>Gymnasia</em>. He notes that in 1906 in Berlin 18 precent of Gymanias sutdents were Jewish, 5x their actual percentage of that state's population. (43) Yet still very few Jews achieved the credentials that they sought: 1895, 65% of Jewis were in trade and commerce and 60% of those were self-employed. (43) So in fact the Jews that hlped shape Berlin's theatre culture were not&nbsp;<em>Bildungsbürger.&nbsp;</em>What shaped this scence then was what Arnold Zweig in his 1928 book Jews on the German stage, was their ""unprejeduced attitude toward the new"", a phenomeono was not in itself Jewish but rather metropolitan, like what one saw in Paris, London, and Madrid. But Jews had a reason to be this way accroding to Zweig, being newcomters to the German aesthetic tradtion. (43)</p>
<p>For those <em>Bildungsbuerger</em> that were a part of the theatre audience, however, their reaction was wrapped up with the changing cahracter of <em>Bildung</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...even they [the Jewish middle class elemnets] could hardly be considered 'assimilating,' because the notion of <em>Bildung</em> that they embraced had long since mutated in German society at large, as George Mosse has argued. Mosse notes that the 'German culture' that Jews found so attractive was the cosmopolitan vision of the German Enlightenment and of German classicism, which was pluralistic, tolerant, heterogenous, and amdire of 'world culture.' That ideal enviiosned in the eighteenth century, however, became profoundly distorted over the course of Germany's national conslidation in the nineteenth century. The global dimension was lost, and a cnaon of national literature and art was established that excluded foreign elements or nationalized themthrough specious rhetoric, such as the claim that Shakespeaer was actually a German(ic) author. The cosmpolitanism of the eighteenth century gave way to a nineteenth-century project to establish cultural homogeneity: to create a Germa culture that was increasingly coded as patriotic, Christian, xenophobic--and anti-Semitic. Universities, were the royal roads&nbsp; to&nbsp;<em>bildungsbürgerliche&nbsp;</em>credentials, were at the forefront of that shift. While student fraternities became hotbeds of anti-Semitism, professors created discriminatory cannons of German culture. A decade before the founding of the Freie Bühne<em>,&nbsp;</em>the prominent historian Heinrich von Treitschke of the University of Berlin touched off the ""Berlin anti-Semitism debate"" with the proclamation: ""the Jews are our misfortune"" (""die Juden sind unser Unglück""). (43-44)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A tthe same time, he notes that Jews were often denied employmetn in the ""official"" institutions of higher edcuation and culture: i.e. unis, court theatres, operas, and museums. This experience of antisemeteism, enlightenment (along with zionism) have helped shaped modern Jewish identity. He cites Micahel Meyer's book on that theme. In reaction, he notes, ""Jews created new cutlural spheres, open nont only to Jewish participation to but a plurality of styles, including novel and experimenta forms... "" (44)</p>
<p>This is the general theme here. And then he provides evidence vv the efforts of Max Reinhardt vv Theatre. He then also shows the realtionshp of this theme to Cabaret culture, which he says would have been ""Unthinkable"" without Jews. And finally film.</p>"
Kant and the Experience of Freedom: Essays on Aesthetics and Morality,"<p>General Notes</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>* Reference to the way Kant's Critique of the Power of Judgement has been taken up as ""the archetypal work of postmodernism, revealing the contradictions inherent in every idea of knowledge, rationality, culture, and art which it has suddenly become so fashionable to discover."" (1)</p>
<p>* He wants to show that this is not the case, or rather that Kant was not simply intrested in works of art in terms of a ""narrow formalism,"" despite the seeming centrality of that idea to ""certain sections of the opening of the 'Analytics of the Beautiful'..."" (2)&nbsp; He wants to show that it's reductive to present Kant as the ""founding father of the idea of 'art for art's sake.'"" (2)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* I think much of Guyer's larger argument here can be summed up in this sentence: ""Kant believed in the intrinsic and indepednent value of of aesthetic experience but also in the uniquely unconditional value of morality, or the primacy of practical reason (that is, the use of reason to determine what we ought to do rather than what is the case).&nbsp; One of my chief purposes in the following essays is to show how Kant tried to make these two beliefs not merely compatibile but interdependent.""

On Creating a Usable Culture: Margaret Mead and the Emergence of American Cosmopolitanism,"<p>2. The Problem of American Culture</p>
<p>p. 19.  She sees the years 1909 and 1911 as crcuial for understanding Mead's intellectual influences.  1909 because of Freud's visit to Clark and Croly's publishing of <em>The Promise of American Life</em>.  Then 1911 because of the publishing of Boas' <em>The Mind of Primitive Man</em>.  This she says was the ""first time the idea of culture as a distinct lifeways appears in his writing.""  (19)  [Is this really true?  The claim needs to be further specififed...I think he makes this point earlier... for example in his article from 1901 by the same title...butt this is certainly more important a text and widely read...]  Also in this year Santayanna gives his lecture ""The Genteel Tradition in American Philosophy"" and also Bourne's set of essay scollected as ""Youth and Life.""  Molloy sums up her paragraph with: ""The rethinking of America around the idea of culture had begun."" (19)</p>
<p>p.19-20: The influence of Freudian theory led to what M. Cowley described as the ""Greenwich Village doctrine"": ""We are unhappy because we are maladjusted, and maladjusted becase we are repressed.""  (quoted on 20).  So there was a need to discover ""hidden motives"" and undo repression.  This gave freedom a new meaning Molloy articles making it something more than ""just a political and economic right.""  ""It now meant health, well-being, 'normalcy."" "" (21)</p>
<p>p.21-22: She makes good use of Croly's <em>The Promise of American Life</em>.  He's advocating a new relationship between thenation and the individual, challenging the separation betwen the two, enviioning a way in which ""each [individual] finds a special niche or function within the nation such that the distinction between national and individual interest disappears and '[t]he individual becomes a nation in miniature,...[and] [t]he nation becomes an enlarged individual."" (22)  For this to occur, there needed to be better regulation of political and economic systems so that the intellect could be set free...Croly then founds the <em>New REpublic</em> with money from wealthy liberals including Elsie Clews Parsons. (22) The influence of this organ is at its greatest during the Wilson admin ""whne it was regarded by some as an unofficail government organ."" (22)</p>
<p>p. 26-27: In Bourne, she quotes Mary Esteve who describes Bourne's notion of the ""experimental life"" as standing for ""nonconformity"" on the one hand and also a sober ""calm disinterestedness"" and ""detached enthusiasm""... a kind of ""scinetific consciousness quoting born: ""to take life not with their naked fists, but more scientifically--to stand with mind and soul alert, ceaselessly testing and criticizing, taking and rejecting, poised for opportunity, and sensitive to all good influences."" (26)  Molloy alsothinks Bourne's Trans-National America article also influenced Mead heavily, describing it as a critique of the melting pot.</p>
<p>p. 27-28: Van Wyck Brooks she says saw the ""relation betweeen the individual and nation as much more organic.""  I.e. she thinks for him it was rooted in a notion of race.  She sums up all three this way: ""Where Croly saw the unity of nation and individaul coming out of individual [pursuit of excellence, Brooks saw the relation between individual and nation as much more oranic.  For Brooks, the relationship between individual and society preceded indivdiual choice or activities.  Croly still worked with the idea of the self-made man, the man who shapes and is haped by the events, cutlure, and opportunities America could provide; Brooks foreshadowed the shift to a mroe determined American: one who expresses an inherence 'race.'  Bourne, on the other hand, while valuing 'racial' or 'cultural' difference, was committed to the idea of conversation, between individuals and between cultures.""  (28-29)</p>
<p>p.29: She notes in a quote from Casey Blake that all three thinkers used different conceptions of culture, using it both in an Arnoldian and a Boasian sense... (29) Yet there wer also differences.  Bourne criticized the ARnoldian conception in his essay ""The Cutl of the Best"" in 1916.  Molloy thinks Bourne had ""Boasian roots"" (29)  Brooks she describes as more ""conservative"" than Bourne, ""more ocncerned with the creation of a unified national culture in which arts and letters could flourish, and perplexed about how that could be achieved in the face of cutlural pluralism in the United States, whereas their ersthle mento, Croly came increasingly to support the repression of cultural difference and the ""Americanization"" of immigrants."" (29)</p>
<p>p. 29: For these critics, ""alienation"" wasn important theme when describing their realtiuonship to ""main street"".  The sense of alieantion she asserts had much to do with a sense of ""provincialism"" to which cosmpolitanism was the alternative.  And she notes that ""[a]nthropology, and the devleopment of the idea of culture as way of life, clearly had a role to play in enabling the emergence of cosmopoitanism, providing both the theoretical concepts and the empirical evidence not only for human variety but also for the intrinsic and extrinsic value of other ways of life."" (30)  <strong>In this desire for cosmpolitanism, howeer, Molloy intelligently picks up on the intellectuals' split attrtaction to the transcendence of ""ethnic limitations"" on the one hand and yet their sense of ""older communitarian ways of life"" as model sof ""un-alienated life"". (30)</strong></p>
<p>p.30: Molloy thinks this ""cultural-nationalist"" movement was big but short,lasting from 1909 to 1918 more or less.  She gives periodization on 30.  It's at its peak in 1915 and then is broken apart by the war and also by the death of Bourne in 1918.  (31)</p>
<p>p.32...Molloy shifts to Mead, saying ""We hqve yet to understand how it is that 'culture' passed into the vernancular during this period, but Margaret Mead was certainly one of the vectors of these ideas.""  Mead she said had taken in the ideas of the cultural nationalists. She had discussed Puritanism and American Cutlure with her friends.  (no evidence here).  She submitted an article to <em>Nation </em>entitled ""The WAste of theProtocracy"" while a masters student in 1924.  She wrote an essay on Bourne's <em>Youth and Life</em> for Benedict and in a letter to B she ""regarded him as having won 'real victories over very live and vicious enemies, these battles...with which my gneration has nothing to do, but calmly accepts the fruits of victory."" (33)  She also admired the way he was able to in Molloy's words ""control his emotional affects 'without theunpelasent deviceds of Electra and Oedipus notions' and that he had 'achieved tolerance and a sense of the place of Puritanism as a rather peurile access to Paganism rather than a veritable menace to be assaulted.'"" (33) In general, Mead was exposed to this work Molloy says through the ""little magazines."" (34)</p>
<p>p.34: Importantly, Molloy argues that as Mead entered college the ""Progressive impulse to integrate American arts, economy, and politics into an 'organic whole' had begun to disintegrate."" (34)  This coincides she says with a shift away from what Groman calls the ""link bewteen lierary-aesthetic and poltiical radicalism"" that M thinks characterized the cultural-nationalist movement...and amove toward a purly literary-aesthetic ethos....a ""modernism based on formal aesthetic criteria..."" (34)  This was a reaction to the post-wwI disillusionment, to the failure of the League of Nation, rampant materialism, and ""boosterism"" she says.  She sees Freud's writings being used to ""support the notion that the cure for what ailed America lay in the individual."" (35)  At the same time, she describes a seires of develompents: rising nubmer of college graduates, a book and print culture emerging out of flood of new publishing houses, and the popularity of books like Fitzgerald's <em>This Side of Paradise</em> and S. Lewis' <em>Main STreet</em>.  that indicated she thinks that it wasn't only the ""intelligentsia"" that was ""dissatisfied with the 'genteel tradition'... and that the broader middle class was interested in ""getting cultured.  (35-36).  She indicates a growing consciousness that linked being cultured with an awareness and rejection of small-town rural American sensibilities.  (36)  And at the ssame time, she notes the move toward Prohibition and the National Origins Act and Johnson Acts that restricted access to the U.S.  (37)</p>
<p>p.37:  Mead she says was at the middle of all of this.  Boas was ana ctivie opponent of the immigration acts.  And Molloy notes well: ""In the hullabaloo about the sexual content of <em>Coming of Age</em>, we are sometimes apt to foret that it was prompted not by concerns abou sex but by concerns about biological determinism."" (38)</p>"
Getting Spliced: Modernism and Sexual Difference,"p.100-102 Stein, Gender and Modernism

Burke explains that this connection between a certain (logopoetic?) mode of modernist writing led to (required?) rethinking gender and sexuality.

She points to Stein's sentence ""...'a splice is something that causes a connection.'"" (quoted on 100).  She notes then on 101 that according to Richard Bridgman ""when Gertrude Stein spoke of the sentence, she was likely to be making symbolic formulations that referred to human relationship as well as verbal ones.'"" (quoted on 101, from Gertrude Stein in Pieces, 197).  Burke points out that ""splice"" was a word used in 19th-century english novels to indicate marriage and she thinks Stein probably was aware of the connection. 

Her point is that Stein's ""formulation of modernist technique--for the splice makes possible one kind of juxtaposition--contains a poetics of gender hidden within its apparently formalist concerns."" (101) 

PUshing futher seh notes that Stein seemed to operate with an ""implicit parallel between verbal connectives and the modes of human intercourse..."" (101)  Burke quotes an account of a discussion with Dashiell Hammett in 1934-34 tour while in California.  In this quote, she suggests that there is a vital link between literary representation and gender-sex.  She notes that men created many types of men in the 19thcentury and women didn't and that the situation had been reversed in the 20th.  Then Burke also quotes her saying ""...'literature--creative literature--unconnected with sex is inconceivable,' then observed cautiously 'but not literary sex, because sex is a part of something of which the other parts are not sex at all.'"" (101)  

This literary rep. is connected to gender she expands in her notion of ""composition"" that she formulated in the course of thinking about modernism.  Each generation differed in the ""way life is conducted"" (uoted on 102) which is ""authentically speak, composition."" (quoted on 102)  She thought that people that lived within a particular ""composition"" rejected its representation and were not aware of that composition; thus writers that reflected it only came to greatness after their death.  But she thought WWI had shifted that: ""...'every one became consciously became aware of the existence of the authenticity of the modern composition' [sic].  In fact, the 'war may be said to have advanced a general recognition of the experession of the contemporary composition almost by thirty years.'"" (102)  

Burke writes: ""Since Stein's account of this 'modern composition' includes the patterns of relationships of those who live within it, we may assume that these comprise the patterns of connections evoked in G.M.P and celebrated in <i>Tender Buttons</i>...Moreover, Stein's phrase implies a parallel between what we no wcall the culture of an era and the way in which the people of that era write: the cultural 'composition' of a given society is reflected in the formal structures of its literary 'compositions.'"" (102)  Note: c.f. with Jameson's idea that modernism vs. post-modernism reflecting shifting social, political, economic circumstances."
The Victorian Connection,"p. 86-88 Liberalism and the Victorian Connection

Hall points out that ""Victorian liberalism was tempered by the awareness of the dangers inherent in democracy, and by a preference or experience over any doctrinaire scheme."" (86)  Hall argues that many Victorian liberals found the right balance in Mill who had drawn upon Coleredige and Bentham.   Mill was popular, and also in the U.S.  He was exelcted a ""corresponding member"" of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1857.  Frederick Law Olmsted's dedicated his The Cotton Kingdom (1861) to him; he communicated with Americans Chauncey Wright and Charles Norton.  He was sseen as a ""prophet"" by a number of young men, e.g. E.L. Godkin and John  Morley who respectively began the Nation in 1865 andthe Fortnightly Reviewin 1867.  (86) 

Specific connections: liberal-minded English visistiors that visited the U.S. to see for themselves the success of the ""American experiment"" made connections with members of the Cambridge-Boston group.  E.g. Godkin who stayed in the US. became friends with Lowell, Norton and the Jameses in Boston and Olmsted, George Ripley and George William Curtis in New York.  Goldwin Smith came in 1864 and was greeted by Norton who description of him is revealing on 86-87.  

Hall thinks Charles Eliot Norton very important in the ""transatlantic network."" (87)  He had inhereted ties to Unitarians in both the United States and Britain fro mhis family.  He edited with Lowell the Norrth American Review.  ""Norton aw the need for another kind of periodical to teach liberalism, and his support enabled the <i>Nation</i> to be founded."" (87) 
He belonged to a cosmpolitan community of the ""best men"" Hall says, and Hall also stresses that this community did not (yet) enjoy culturla hegemony..  Hegemony was still primarily in the hands of the evangelicals and the entrepreneurs he says (87-88)  He notes that <i>The Atlantic MonthLY</i> which ""flew proudly the flag of humanism"" under the leadership of Howells would not run a story of Mark Twains for fear of  alienating religious-evangelical readers.. (88)"
"""The Foundations of All Future Researches"": Franz Boas, George Hunt, Native American Texts, and the Construction of Modernity","p. 494 - 8   Boas' Textual Authority

-- Boas tried to validate Hunt's writings, but not via Hunt as an ""individual.""  Boas appears to downplay or even hide details about Hunt's identity.  (494)  

-- It is possible that Boas obscured Hunt's role to protect Hunt from laws forbidding participation in certain ceremonies. (495)

-- Boas enacted as set of ""erasures"" which hid the ""complexity of life in Fort Ruper as well as the embeddedness of the texts in white-Native American relations."" (495)  This was what they would call a ""detextualization"" of the production of the text and they note that since Boas excluded Hunt's own accounts  of wher eand how he acquired texts, that ""Boas...retained control over the metadiscursive practices tha shped its authority."" (495) 

-- Boas also noted furstration with the problem that the texts came from Hunt alone.  This raised questions about whether these texts reflected an individual or a tribal ivew point.  Boas tried to re-request certain texts or to confirm them with his own fieldwork, and when confirmed the authors note that boas ""minimized the textual gaps"" between repeated accounts. (496)  

-- Boas also resisted the attempts of Henry W. Tate to excercise his own metadiscursive authority...when Boas realized through comparing his texts with those collected by Tate, that TAte had as Boas put it ""felt it incumbent upon himself to omit some of those traits of the myths of his poele that seem inappropriate to us, and there is no doubt that in this respect the tales do not quite express the odl type of Tsimshian traditions."" (quoted on 496, from p.31 Tsimshian Mythology).  Boas was however more troubled when he realized that Tate had begun to read collections of tales that he had already published.  Boas wrote then: ""...I called his attention at once to the necessity of keeping strictly to the form in which the traditions are told by the Tsimshian."" (quoted on 496, from ""Tsimshian Mythology"" in Thirty-First Annual Report of the Bureau of American Ethnology
(Washington, D.C., 1916), 291037. p. 31)  But Boas did not have the same concerns when Hunt read colelctions (496) Still Boas resisted Hunt's attempts to excercise an authorial metadiscursive control.. (496-7)

-- Boas justification of resisting his informants metadiscursive control came from his ability to confirm and cross-check the accuracy of informatoin he receieved, and in his writing o fthe preface of collections of stories.  Therefore co-authoring did not necessarily mean that boas shared authorial control (497-8)"

A line linking into the historiography of Boasians as critiques of racism: ""Even once this biologistic version of race theory came under fire from progressive strands in the human sciences, namely Boasian anthropologists, racial difference came to mean immanent cultural difference."" (333-334)

The critique here is this: ""Boas's framework could have provided him with a basis ffrom which to collect narratives that documented ongoing struggles by Native American communities for survival, certain types of narratives, exhorations, and ht like are grossly underplayed in the extant corpus.  The broader issue here invovles not only selectivity but the political effects of using metadiscursive practices that systematically sever connections between texts and the complex historical circumstances in which they were collected.  Boas's genuine concern for invovling Native Americans in the process of etnographic documentation and for seeing indigenous communities through indigenous lenses did not induce him to surrender control over the metadiscursive practices that shaped the production and reception of texts.""

Historiography and Enlightenment,"[Summary Card]
This essay by Pocock is a review/response to John Robertson's The Case for the Enlightenment: Scotland and Naples, 1680-1760.  Robertson's book apparently refers to what Pocock calls a ""friendly debate"" between a view of the  Enlightenment as a single process taking place in a number of places and a view that , in Pocock's words, ""reduces it to a family of distinnguishable processes taking place in a number of historical contexts--some of which, horrible dictu, were national and provided by nation states--with the result that there ceases to be any such thing as 'the Enlightenment'..."".  
What Pocock does in the article is distinguish a separate process that is deserving of the title of enlightenment but which is not the process described by Robertson.  The process he describes is one carried out mostly by historians and which deals with a challenge to the sacred authority of the church by anlayzing the historiography of philosophy wherein the attempts by humans to understand how Word of God was made Flesh in Jesus Christ are seen as a struggle fo humans with language.  This has the effect of removing the sacred quality of theology and seeing it instead as history.  This is a process of Enlightenment Pocock says, and it is one that Robertson's history, which deals with philosophers attempts to conceptualize the growth of human civil society through stages, does not deal with at all.
Pocock then goes on to argue that the presence of this alternate process, which he admits converges at points with the philsophers' Enlightenment, means that Robertson cannot term his Enlightenment ""the Enlightenment.""  
There are many things about this account that I find useful.  The main thing at this point is, in the writing of my ""War Chapter,"" that this article could be cited in as evidence for the claim that there was a notion of historical advancement and progress that was conceivable within a historiographical tradition, and which was carried out in England!  Thus this is an artilce that helps to establish that within England and other nations associated with natural philosophy, there was also a strong and important tradition of historical thought ongoing..."
A Four-Fold Humanity: Margaret Mead and Psychological Types,"p.190-1  Four-Field Humanity

Mead's Types elaborated in this Squares Theory. 

First focused on Male and Female.  or Northern and Southerner.  There were many diagrams.  But Sullivan thinks that there were no particular general meanings ass. with these directions.  

In ""summary Statement"" Mead also talks about fey and Turk.  

These types were not opposites they she said to her sister Elizabeth Stieg ""have a great deal in comoon with each other' while also 'being antithetical'"" (191)  

She sought to create psych tests for this (191-2)  had to do with sadism and masochism. 

In ""Summary Statmeent"" she these types in terms of reaction to suffering.  She writes in commentary for Rapaport ( see Lib. Congress S11:7) that ""These two positions [North and South] are reciprocals on the 'sado-masochisticic' axis, that is those in the N[orthern] position can laugh at a joke about cruelty, but can not face a real situation of suffering [while] those in the S[outhern] positon seen othing to laugh about in the jokes about cruelty, but see the real situation clearly and without defenses exception soometimes a grimace and nervous laugh."" (192) 

The East-West axis on the other hand was different.  Dealt with "" ""unreality or reality of events""  .  That means also that as Mead said (again in letter to Rappaport) about relations between ""onself and other people""...or as she said to sister ""If Northerners and Southerners deal with things, it si primarily as symbolic of relationships"".   (quoted on 193)

"The Soul's Economy: Market Society and Selfhood in American Thought, 1820 - 1920","<p>p.031 Sklanksy's defense of political economy</p>
<p>As a conclusion to chapter 1, Sklansky notes that political economy in the next step of his book will be seen to provoke a Romantic critique of classical political economy.  But he states here already that its view of ""economic man as a soulless autonomaton"" was ""grossly caricatured"" (31)  Then he lays out a defense of classical political economy:</p>
<p>He acknowledges that the notion of the autonomos self-governing individual (with a rational will and ability to labor) was tied to notions of white male supremacy and privilege.  But he gives a nod to the idea that this ""radically egalitarian understanding of human nature and society"" exceeded the limits of classical political eocnomy: ""If political economy concealed essential aspects of social life, it also revealed the material basis of 'commerical society' in ways that proved more effective in inciting rebellion than in promoting the harmony and stability of the new social order."" (31)</p>
<p>So two things 1) Sklansky seems to like classical political economy because it promoted class-consicous politics and undermined itself.  2) It's because classical political economy undermined itself that a new social science was needed which began with these Romantic critiques of classical political economy...</p>

Culture: The Anthropologist's Account,"p. x-xi  Kuper thinks the word culture should be avoided.  The point of this book.

""...the more one considers the best modern work on culture by anthropologists, the more advisable it must appear to avoid the hyper-referential word altogether, and to talk more precisely of knowledge, or belief, or art, or technology, or tradition, or even of ideology (though similar problems are raised by that multivalent concept).  There are fundamental epistemological problems, and these cannot be solved by tiptoeing around the notion of culture, or by refining definitions.  The difficulties become most acute when...culture shift from something to be described, interpreted, even perhaps explained, and is treated instead as a source of explanation itself...appeals to culture can offer only a partial explanation of why people think and behave as they do, and of what causes them to alter their ways.  Political and economic forces, social institutions, and biological processes cannot be wished away, or assimilated to systems of knowledge and belief.""  (x-xi)"
The Politics of Sex and Gender: Benhabib and Butler Debate Subjectivity,"<p>Notes 7/10/10:</p>
<p>Webster analyzes a debate between Seyla Benhabib and Judith Butler about subjectivity and selfhood the political subject of feminism.&nbsp; The question at the center of the essay is the idea of a crisis in feminist theory relating to the sense that the categories of sex and gender have become so complex and unstable that they no longer serve as a useful basis for feminist politics or for ""women's agency"" more specifically.&nbsp; Webster purports to undestands to be at work in so-called postmodern theory"" and then at Butler's notion of performative agency.</p>
<p>Benhabib along with other feminists cited in fn#2 have critiqued postmodern theory for creating a ""identity crisis"" for feminism.&nbsp; Webster says that Benhabib thinks that postmodernism in its ""strong form"" (?) ""promotes a dissolution of the subject which in turn dissolves the concepts of intentionallity, accountability, self-reflexivity and autonomy."" (3) The autonomous suject is then repalced with a ""fractured, opaque self."" (3)&nbsp; Benhabib thinks this is problematic for women in particular, given that their subject position and autonomy in western society is already weak.</p>
<p>Butler's performative conception of agency is laid out in <em>Gender Trouble</em>.&nbsp; Webster defines it this way: ""...gender is performative...in the sense that it it is not a stable or fixed point of agency, but rather is an identity category created and constituted through 'a stylized repetition of acts.'&nbsp; Its meaning is constituted dramatically and contingently through sustained social performances which take place in the context of the regulatory conventions and norms dominant in society.&nbsp; The ultimate effect of these repeated performances is an appearance of substance, an appearance of gender as a natural expression of particular bodies.&nbsp; This repeition rigidifies and institutionalizes gender.&nbsp; At the same time, the very activity of this repetition of norms suggets for Butler the possibility that those norms can be subverted.&nbsp; Indeed, it is precisely in this variation in the way in which subjects actively repeat norms that Butler locates agency."" (4)</p>
<p>Benhabib's critique of Butler's critique of agency targets the ""sorts of social research paradigms"" that Butler uses.&nbsp; She says that in her words Butler ""still presupposes a remarkably deterministic view of individuation and socialization processes whcih falls short of the currently available social-scientific refletions on the subject."" (quoted on 4).&nbsp; She thinks basically that Butler grants too much power to culture and too little power to individuals (i.e. Butler is essentially too Foucaultian.) Second, Benhabib critiques Butler's account of agency because it, again in her words, ""wants to extend the limits of reflexivity in thinking about the self beyond the dichotomy of 'sex' and 'gender.'"" (quoted on 5)&nbsp; The problem is that Butler wants to locate agency ""beyond"" the binary sex/gender dichotomy. Butler understands sex as ""always already gender"" (5), i.e. sex does not ""pre-exist gender."" (5)&nbsp; In <em>Situating the Selfi, </em>Benhabib would agree that sex is not just anatomical; the definition of sex is for her also, in her words, ""a social and historical process...Sex and gender are not related to each other as nature to culture."" (quoted on 5).&nbsp; But she dislikes Butler's use of performativity because it cannot ""do justice to the complexities of the ontogenetic origins of gender in the human person."" (B qutoed on 5) It doesn't give an adequate account in her mind of the ""strutural and developmental processes which are in fact involvedin individual socialization..."" (6) and it doesn't account of the ""capacities individuals possess for som degree of self-determination."" (6)</p>
<p>So there is a point of stand off here.&nbsp; Butler in her words wants to say ""there is no ontologically intact reflexivity to the subject which is then placed within a cultural context..."" (6).&nbsp; That conclusion meanwhile is exactly waht Benhabib is trying to resist.&nbsp; She talks about ""ontogenetic origins"" of gender and says Butler doens't account for them.&nbsp; Yet importantly Benhabib is not positing an ""autonomous"" self that acts outside of its cutlural context.&nbsp; She argues that ""subjects have the capacity to to challenge their 'situatedness,' to contribute to the constitution of their own identity and to their own place in the world..."" (6)&nbsp; Reflexivity is an important word for her. On another level, Webster notes, Benhabib also wonders whether it is necessary to dissolve concepts of agency, autonomy, and selfhood in order to challenge the ""heterosexist and dualist positions in the women's movement""; i.e. does Butler ""need"" to take such a radical position.</p>
<p>Butler's response.&nbsp; Butler doesn't think feminism needs a stable subject.&nbsp; She thinks there is a ""specific version of politics"" available by recognizing the instability of such categories: ""...the character of the political arena is itself brought into question once the premises upon which it is based (premises such as the very 'stability' or 'unity' of the subject) are shown to be problematic."" (7) i.e. Butler wonders what kind of political domain wold neccesitate a stable female subject in order to actualize women's agency?</p>
<p>Most importantly, Butler's concept of agency: Butler rejects Simone de Beuavoir's sex/gender distinction ""on the grounds that it presupposes an account of the subjet at some point 'free' from gender and as capable of deliberately 'taking up' their gender.""&nbsp; For Butler, there&nbsp; is no ""doer behind the deed""--an idea which she says is built into liberal formulations of agency, which likes to assign ""blame and accountability."" (8).&nbsp; The ""doer"" for Butler is instead constituted by the ""deed.""&nbsp; But this does nto disallow agency she does not think.&nbsp; It is precisely because the ""subject is the site of endless transformation that and resignification"" that resistance and therefore agency is possible.&nbsp; Butler thinks that Benhabib misunderstands her theory of performativity, in her words, by ""grammatically reinstalling the subject 'behind' the deed, and by reducing...the notion of performativity to theatrical performance."" (quoted on 8).</p>
<p>Their difference conceptions of the poltiical domain is also a critical difference: Butler challenges the idea that political life has certain norms or requirements, whereas Benhabib talksabout the ""importance of striving toward autonomy as an ideal in political life."" (9)</p>
<p>Webster wonders whether Butler's conception fo the political domain offers any ""programmatic"" assistance ot the feminist movement, and thinks that there are real limits there.&nbsp; This is where others, like Susan Hekman, have critiqued Butler for giving up ""the basis for a feminist politics."" (i.e. see Hekman, ""Subjects and Agents: The Question for Feminism"" in <em>Provoking agents: Gender and agency in theory and practice,</em> ed. Gardiner (1995).&nbsp; Webster pinpoints Butler's sense that the category of woman is constantly being reconstructed, and is a site of contest.&nbsp; Apparently, Butler takes this in part of Slovoj Zizek's idea that political signifiers are ""empty signs which come to bear phantasmic investment of various kinds...""</p>
<p>[Note: It seems clear to me that in fact feminism has made much ""programmatic"" use out of the idea that the notion of woman cannot be defined...I mean really this goes back to the historical debate that cropped up after the 19th Ammendment, this idea that women shouldn't push for ERA because this would undermine the specific rights they had gained for women, as such...]</p>
<p>Webster rightly notes that Butler's critique interprets agency as ""resistance,"" whereas Benhabib and Beauvoir deifne it as a capacity for generating intentional effects. (11, bottom).&nbsp; Webster summarizes the different positions on bottom of 11 too.</p>"
"Conspicuous Criticism: Tradition, the Individual, and Culture in American Social Thought, from Veblen to Mills","<p># General Notes: 1/2013</p>
<p>## Introduction</p>
<!-- p, li { white-space: pre-wrap; } -->
<p style=""text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">* Shannon links culture to a way of thinking and “being in the world” (xii) that set reason against tradition. His aim? To describe culture as an extension of that point of view inward, onto our “souls,” in order to expose them to rationality and objectivity. In the very first paragraph of the book he talks about wanting to question the “larger social-scientific project of the rational control of society.” (ix) I’m into that, but I (1) don’t do it in order to defend a relationship to the soul contained in Catholic theology, however subtle (Shannon I think is catholic, although he doesnt’ give this away in his book) and (2) because I would narrate the link between culture and Cartesian radical doubt differently. Culture, in my account, is a way to describe a different self...</p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">* Very revealing sentence (when combined with a statement earlier that he’s not providing “a causal account so much as an account of causality” (xi)):</p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-style: italic;"">&gt;Freed from preconceptions as to any “natural” order, Cartesian philosophy saw man creating order by analyzing nature into its constituent parts and synthesizing those parts into a causal order capable of being redirected toward chosen ends. With nature reduced to the mechanical laws of cause and effect, the limits of the possible stood as the only objective limits on human desire.” (xi) </span></p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">* He sees Cartesianism a bit like Adorno and Horkheimer as reducing nature to a mechanistic and atomizing gaze, but then he also combines it with a sense of a human desire that has lost all limiting norms. He’s the Catholic Adorno and Horkheimer!</p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">* He sees cultural thought, like all social scientific thought, as complicit or basically carrying out the same basic function as capitalism, which is to expose more and more of life to control and manipulation by human desire; the emphasis on a human desire out of control in this regard is important because it is also what links social scientific thought to capitalism; one can easily see how in his mind the Enlightenment freed human desire to rationalize human existence, which then capitalism has hitched to mechanisms of value production and in commercial society also the production of desire itself. (See e.g. xii-xii)</p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">* He even refers to “the moral anarchy latent in the social-scientific instrumentalization of all social relations.” (xiii), saying that ""American intellectuals have struggled"" with it. (xiii) And he says they've had two responses: 1) segregation, i.e. exempting certain domains of life from the ""instrumental logic of the market"", i.e. the doctrine of ""separate spheres"" for men and women. (xiii); or 2) (which is the mainstream of social-scientific thought, he thinks) the ""strategy of integration"" through which the ""dynamic isntrumentalizatino of values"" is itself taken as a a ""value capable of rpomoting social order if proeprtly extended to every aspect of life."" And this is impulse is what he thinks has led to the idea of ""culture as a whole way of life."" (xiii)</p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">* He says this strategy of integration took shape with Veblen's 1899 *Theory of the Leisure Class*. (xiii-ix), which&nbsp; he thinks is interesting because of its economic approach to culture (rather than the other way around). He means the way Veblen viewed things like leisure, religion, marrtiage, etc (ie cultural activiteis) as extra and the basis of ""invidious comparison"" and ""pecuniary manipulation"" and so on. Veblen he says had a notion of ""primary utility"" that had to do with industrial relations, which somehow Veblen he thinks like to an idea of the ""fullness of life of the indivudal, taken in absolute terms."" (Veblen, quoted xiv). Shannon's problem with this is not only that Veblen took such a narrow view of the individual vv cultural activities, but also his relentless critique that sought to define the individual in ""absolute terms."" He says this tradition of critiuqe is **conspicuous** because it has failed to ""acknowledge or articulate a normative order in which such a goal [achieving the fullness of life of the indivdiual] could have any meaning."" (xiv)</p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">* He then jumps to culture cncept. The idea of a ""pattern of values"" he says indicated ""a kind of normative ordering principle"", but then he says that culture ""remained an objective social whole with no power over the inquiring subject."" (xiv) [Here, I see what he means vv the idea that culture's were treated as objectivities -- judgement withheld -- but not that these entities were seen as having no power over individuals; a cultural enttity could not exist but for its ability to power (or empower) individuals recreate the pattern of values.]</p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">* The next paragraph clarifies even more what he does not like. The relationship between autonomous subject and ""objective social whole"" that the cutlure concept points up becomes in modern life a ""substitute for the constitutive relations of tradition that united subject and object in premodern thought."" (xiv) So he's nostalgic or desirous of tradition that sustains the unified self; i.e. true autonomy for him requires tradition, and not critical doubt.</p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">* This previous point : culture -&gt; uproots traditon -&gt; uproots the unity of subject object then forms a chiasmus with capitalism. So this social-scientific tradition of ""conspicuous criticism"" is complicit with capitalism because both are committed to ""the critical project of uprooting all received traditons."" So: social-scientific tradition destroys traditon: destroyed tradition opens society to the instrumetnal logic of the market. (xiv) The problem is then not consumption but in fact the producer ideal that goes much deeper; notions of ""work ethic"" or ""workmanhship."" (xiv) In the domain of poltiical economy has ""served as a single standard of instruemtnality hostile to all normative ordering principles and proximate ends or values."" (xiv) And historically he thinks it was a substitute for ""the mediating rites and devotional practices of the Catholic Church"" for Protestants who used it to find a way to connect their lives to God ""through an abstract, personal discipline that could be cultivated in the everyday world of work and famiily."" (xv)</p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">* As an alternate notion of critique, he assciates himself with the ""Roman Catholic instisnce that reaeson, belief, and even unblief make sense only in the context of osme received tradition of inquiry."" (xv) He says of this kind of critique that it is not ""free or open"" but involves ""submission"" to the ""community of knowers"" and also that ""its end is to some degree always present in its beginning."" (xv)&nbsp; This last point seems important as one objection he has to the critical tradition he wants to critique is that it is always trying to revise and reinterpret so as to get ""beyond"" the critique that came before (179); in the process it genereates a whole mess of relations of facts and interpretations that create a kind of ""waste"" also -- and here he jabs at Veblen for having critique conspicuous consumption and also this is what he menas by conspicuous criticism -- that it is wasteful. (ssee xiv, 179).</p>

<p style=""text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">## 5. Culture for What?</p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">&gt; Note: This chapter is where Shannon really rolls out his sense of culture as a key category through which the social-scientific ethos that he's describing really achieves its reimagining of social life as ""culture.""</p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">* What is culture for he thinks? In the 1930s he thinks there is a shift from seeing culture as a ""tool for objective analysis to seeing the idea of culture as itself a normative ording principle for social life."" He says this shift reached its ""culmination"" in Lynd's 1939 *Knowledge for What?*. (105)</p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p>* He  says for instance that for Lynd culture is not so much a rational  technocratic order as a ""reality principle"": ""For Lynd, culture serves  not so much as a principle of order as a reality principle that smashes  accepted theory."" (107)</p>
<p>* There is a complexity to the realtionship between the individual and culture in his analysis. But the notion of the self that is being developed he thinks is based on that of the social scientists:</p>
<p>&gt; ...the stakes of agency shift from having motivations -- or perhapsit is safer to say having reasons for one's actions -- to explaining reasons and motivations. If people make culture, so, too, culture makes people; to be a conscious person one must be able to see oneself in a causal chain in whcih one is both cause and effect. To be a person, one must become a social scientist, on the boundaries of one's own culture, transgressing cultural norms."" (110)</p>
<p>* Shannon thinks that as part of this use of culture, the social scientists is given access to the domain of values, but at the same time this access is premised ona&nbsp; suspicion of traditional values, and a desire to bring those values ""down to earth"" and reduce them to ""cravings."" (110-111, esp. 111, top of the page)</p>
<p>* A key passage here is 113, the full paragraph, where Shannon finally lets loose his critique of Lynd's vision of culture. The social sceintists he says gets full access to domains of the self that had previouly not been attended to, to thumb-sucking or bed-wetting. The point being that the individual should start to see themselves as a mere effect, a conscience of themselves as being a point in a long chain of causality, that should offer the opportunity to control and liberate, that is a kind of democratic control. [Ultiamtely, what he's targeting here is social control, it seems to me; so his frame is accurate but too narrow...] Thus the educated citizen is really the one that is basically a asocial scientist him or herself. He notes ""Witness in our own time, how the most successful products of drug rehabilitation programs tend to become counceslors themsevles.) (113)</p>
<p>* For Lynd the problem in all of this is that there is a kind of distinction enforced upon the population where only certain people get access to expesnsive specilized services, and what he wants is a universalization of social science. (113)</p>
<p>* But Shannon does not want to join others who have accussed Lynd of sliding into a technocratic view with this book. He thinks that's not the poitn. The point is the conception of agency that Lynd was developiong, whcih linked up with that of Veblen and Benedict. The point here is ""The opening up of all aspects of life to social-scientific inquire signals not a surrender to techocratic domination but a surrender of one's previously causal attitude toward one's own life."" (114)</p>
<p>* In this surrender, what is being forced out is a form of self-regulation that was adapted to the market, for a kind of self-regulation in the social-scientific mode. BUT he argues that this shift obscures the deeper continuity, for social science also embodies a laissez-faire attitue he notes in its all-out assault on traditional restrictions. (115) He notes the ""separate spheres"" idea of the nineteenth-century marked out a limit to the market principle; but in Lynd he sees a total invasion of this domain. He writes: ""It is as if the market had experienced a failure of nerve in its assault on tradition, with only social science left to take up the fight."" (115)</p>
<p>&gt; Note: Here is where a Polanyian critique totally supercedes Shannon's critique. Because it allows us to think about this invasion of the domain of social protection in different terms, even though it does retain (as Fraser has noted) a degree of Shannon's essentialism.</p>
<p>* He sums up his view again on 116 in a way that gets at the thrus of the critique: ""This public experiences the bracking of all assumptions, the detachment fromall loyalties not voluntarily entered into, and the relenteless examination of every aspect of one's life as liberation. This public has everything to gain from the ascendency fo th social-scientific worldivew of *Knowledge for What?*, a worldview that demands only that everyone submit to the discipline of becoming self-creating individuals.""

<p style=""text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">* He critiques a culture of irony, or a ""capitulation to irony"" that has emerged from the tradition of critique (tied to a ""Critical Ideal"").&nbsp; Mill is one apotheosis of thsi tradition. Rorty's postmodernist bourgeois liberalism also. The focus in this tradition is on ""maximum material prosperity for all combined with an 'aestheticized culture' of self-creating individuals."" (176) Here he has a sharp critique:</p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">&gt; This schizophrenic consensus on social meliorism and philosophic nihilism would have people shuttle back and forth between a practical quest for certainty in their 'public,' social lives,a nd an equally practical rejection of all certtainty in their 'private,' individual lives. Acceptance of this schizophrenia then stands as the mark of a mature responsible, ironic self. (176-177)</p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">* He then just says that he hates this ""culture of irony"" and that for those committed to it he has ""northing more to say."" (177) He is interested in engaging ""premodern thought in an attempt to live within some kind of nonironic social and intellectual world..."" (177) To get at this he will look at some antimodern critiques of the Enlightenment, the work of Christopher Lasche, aqnd then also the philsophy of Hannah Arrendt which he thinks might provide a useful philosohpical jumping off piont..."" (177)</p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">* Before getting into these attempts, he does a bit more criticla clearing. He wants to debunk ""modernity's self-proclaimed monpoly on complexity and uncertainty."" (177) He targets Dewey's Quest for Certainty essay, which he thinks misreads history and creates a narrative within which present is more mature than primitive or immature past in that it is ""tolerant of ambiguity&nbsp; rather than demanding clarity."" (177) This reading he says treats premodern thought arrogantly as ""imperfect versions of modern science, as if modern and premodern thought were somehow commensurable due to a common concern for controlling nature."" (177) He'll admit that premodern thought that was directed at control was not particularly great, but what this account misses are those parts of premodern thought not directed at control that moderns he thinks either don't udnerstand or don't care to. (177-178) Here then is an atlernative notion of ""complexity,"" -- this area that premodern thought addressed well he seems to think. He develops it with Roberto Unger's ideas on 178. It has to do with ambiguity of meaning as a ""central trope"" of the ""ancient humanistic arts"" -- aprocess that was without end etc... Basically, eh presents this as a more complex treatment of the hermeneutic circle, one that does not need to clearly distincguish between ""description or evalution""...and this goes back to his point in the intro about a form of criqiue that is embedded in a tradition, and the point of which is already present at the beginning.</p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">* This point of view that he ddescribes on 178, he then contrasts with the modern social scientific one, that he gets at in part by looking at the sociology of religion, which is always trying to separate the object (religion) from the description (the scientists, and the science). This creates a radical self-reflexivity and a ""suspicion of the very process of studying the object..."" (179)&nbsp; ther eis a suspicion he says not just of the non (or pre) theoretical but also of the past theoretical, ie preivous theories. And so it sets up a process of revision, ""a refinement of method that incorporates and explains both a greater number of facts and a greater number of relations between facts in such a way as to make previous accounts obsolete."" (179) WHEREAS his version of critique rooted in ""moral community"" avoids this by assuming a ""tautology of tradition"" as a preconditino for critiique, for knowing anything at all."" (179) So one should submit to this tradition and thereby gain the capacityto think and critique. In his case, this means sumbmitting to Catholic tradition and to the ""priority of the moral community as a guarantor of rationalty"" (180). It also means he says submitting in order to become a certain kind fo person that can think. (179). The modern social-scientific tradition, he thinks, in rejecting this ideaq and turning to 'epistemology"" has ""fostered a social ideal of an isoalted individual consciousness as exsiting somehow prior to or apart form a community of inquiry..."" (180)</p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">[Note: There seems to be a big mistake in his account, or soemthign his missing from his account of modernity. Because the professions do in fact involve the process of submission he's talking about. It's INCREDIBLY relevant that, as I show in my book, the anthropologists associated culture with the professions. So he's just wrong there. But it's also relevant that the last part of his argument in the previous bullet point, that the turn to epistemology involved the positing of an isolated consciousness that is prior to the community...well that is true of Cartesianism, but not of Dewey or James or the kind of modern scientism that developed at the end of the nineteenth century. So he's kind of setting up a straw man of modern thought/cutlure here, which is not surprising given his catholicism. The point is that he doesn't want just any normative order: he wants a Catholic normative order!]</p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">* VV the indvidiual and culture. The positing of an isolated consciousness he thinks has shifted the attention away from the ""tautology of community to the soilipsism of the indiuvidual."" (180) This solipsism has been created by the ""initial braceting of all traditions, beliefs, and 'social conditions'"" (180) and it has then been renered positively as ""autonomy"" (whereas he thinks real autonomy comes from being embedded in tradition, which secures as he said in the intro the unity of subject and object). Modern social though tthen also pictureed a ""rational social order"" named the ""social whole"" that has he says ""been a substitute for the premodern notion of tradition"" (180), but this ideal of the social whole has ever been elusive since it was set up in the 18th century. In the U.s., the idea of ""community"" emerged as an alternative to the market; then culture in the 20th century as an alternative to the ""potentially alientating social whole of bureacuracy."" (180). On culture:</p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">&gt; At its height in the 'consensus' era of the 1950s, the idea of cutlure as a whole way of life promised to synthesize tradition (necessity) and the individual (freedom). Culture has since proven itself to be yet another objective social whole engaged in a&nbsp; ceaseless dialectical struggle with autonomous subjects."" (180)</p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">[Note: this take on culture is useful and clever. It's useful because it confirms my feeling that I need to have last chapter that looks at culture in this moment of ""consensus"" . Also vv his critique, it is clever because he saw through what I think is true, that some of these 50s social scientists using the concept did treat it as a kind of ideal linking up of tradition and freedom. Parsons may be the best soruce here (and also interesting to consider how Habermas is figuring in, given that you can here echoes of life-/systems-world themes here). But he's right! That what it did produce in the end was just more dialectical struggle, only that is GOOOOOOD!! in my book.]</p>

<p style=""text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""># Chapter 1 - The Perspective of Workmanship</p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">* This chapter presents a very interesting interpretation of Veblen, that focuses in particularly on his book the *Instinct of Workmanship*. The point Shannon wants to make is that contrary to most accounts who have interpreted Veblen as someone who critiqued consumerist society in favor of production, whilst unwittingly defending technocracy, Shannon things this critique misses the point of his work. He presents Veblen's account of history from the point of view of workmanship. Indeed, Veblen does celebrate the handworker in the guild context, but he's optimistic about the transitional moment of the present. The key when it comes to Veblen's interpretation of modernity is his notion of a machine age and the machine process, but the point here is not the machine, but the machine as metaphor: the machine as a metaphor for a kind of process and mentality that in Shannon's reading involves a kind of ""iconoclastic"" individual. That is, Veblen's worker is not a conformist, but rather is conforming to a kind of iconoclastic social type, a type who is not a passive actor but who is a ""creative participant"" in the wokr process. This is the ""discipline of thought,"" as Veblen terms it, that the machine represents. (see esp. 18-21). For Shannon, what is mean by ""culture"" is this machine ""discipline of thought"" in which the iconoclastic worker is participating, see his substitution on 21 of culture for ""mechanical process"" in the quote first presented on 20.</p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">* This sets up Shannon's difference with other interpreters of progressivism. He notes that the theme that is consistent between Veblen and thinkers like Dewey or Jane Addams is that of giving ""the worker a sense of his place in the whole process."" (22) That of course is what Veblen means by the idea of the iconoclastic ""creative participant"" worker. (see quotes on 20). This theme has led interpreters to interpret progressives either as emphasizing a ""demcoratic"" inclusion of the worker in the work process, or a kind of technocratic ""therapeutic"" industrial psychology. Both interpretations mistake these thinkers for talking about ""actual jobs,"" whereas he thinks they were emphasizing a certain mentality, a ""perception of a process,"" a way of thinking about ""work as a process that has a history, that has developed over time, and that has certain distinct stages."" (22) He talks about Addams' workers museum. The *Instinct of Workmanship*he points out is itself an embodiment of this machine process mentality.&nbsp;&nbsp; To put it very clearly, he says, the ""potentialities"" that are consistent with the machine process are "" the iconoclastic habit of mind and the matter-of-fact apprehnension of men and things."" (22)</p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">* The link between workers and intellectuals is based on this iconoclasm: ""The interdependence fostered by the modern machine process binds workers and intellectuals together not by allowing for technocratic manipulation of wokeres by intelelctuals but by spreading the single standard of critical thinking to every social class."" (23)</p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">* Shannon the ends his chapter -- appropriately but also somewhat bizarely -- with a discussion of Veblen's essay on ""The Intellectual Pre-Eminence of Jews in Modern Europe,"" an essay that emphasizes the way Jews have reached their cultural preeminence through their embrace of hybridity -- hybridity is a principle that Veblen himself celebrates and that Shannon discusses earlier in the chapter, see 6-7. For VEblen, Shannon says, it is the boundary crossing -- the hybridity -- that creates the skeptical frame of mind. His account of this frame of mind is pretty sneering, and even verges on the old antisemetic trope -- the destructive criticism of the jew is the same destructiveness of capitalism:</p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">&gt; Such an understanding of the world, however, issues in alienation from the world. The outsider/intellectual ""becomes a disturber of the way intellectual peace, but only t the cost of becoming an intellectual way-faring man, a wanderer in the intellectual no-man's-land, seeking another place to rest, farther along the road, somewhere over the horizon. The are neither a complaistant nor a contended lot, these aliens of the uneasy feet; but that is, after all, not the point in question."" (IPJE,"" 22). What is the point in question? Simply the constant intellectual wandering that is criticism. Critiism may liberate, or it may alienate, but it&nbsp; must be free to wander, and in that wandering be free to uproot any tradition it may find. With criticism, as with capitalism, all that is solid melts into the air. (25)</p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">* Shannon sees this machine process basically as a symbol of a clearing ideal that will uproot all tradition... he hates it.</p>

Women in Early American Anthropology,"p. 043 - 54 Alice Fletcher

-- Born 1838.  Born in Cuba.  There appears to have been wealth.  Began work at Peabody through a special fellowship set up by Mr.s Mary Copley Thaw of Pistburg in 1891.  (43)

-- She was committed to social welfare work which O-L thinks ""blindered her to the persistent force of soial identity among American Indian poeples and the real significance of interelationpships between economics and other aspects of culture."" (44)

-- Still O-L describes her ethnographic work as accurate and as ""among the classics of American anthropology"" (44) 

-- When she died in 1923 she was descibed in mixed ways by men.  O-L does not really explicitly note this, but these reflect real ambivalence by the men on gendered level. O-L quotes ""Some of her opponents never were quite sure what quiet, deep river had just drifted along and left them stranded far from their selfish hopes.  She didn't fight--any more than the snowflake and the sunbeam fight. Like them, she Just Kept On."" (45)   Another quote describes her as a ""dreafully opinionated woman"".  (45)  O-L doesn't cite the page numbers here, but she cites Charles F. Lummis, ""In Memoriam, Alice C. Fletcher"" Art and Archeology, XV (1923) and ""Alice C. Fletcher Memorial Meeting,"" El Palacio, XVI (1923), 83-88.  

-- She went into the field with Thomas Henry Tibbles -- minister, journalist, and 1904 Populist Party vice Presidential candidate.   He was dubious of her ability to deal with the conditions of the field. (45-46).   She first went into the field o Sept. 1. 1881 among the Omaha (where later Mead would work for a summer.) (46)  She worked with Tibbles, and his Omaha helper Wajapa. O-L critizies her for not being aware of the effect of going into the field with Tibbles and his ""assimialted"" assistant.  (47) 

-- Most interesting is that Alice Fletcher drafted a precursor to the Dawes Act: her Omaha Act of 1882, which was designed to help the Omaha, who were afraid of losing their land like the Ponca, est. grants for farms. They had asked her for help.  She decided that they should be given plots of land.  In the ACt she drafted they would be ""allotted eighty acresto remain tax-free and held in trust by the govenrment for a period of twenty-five years after which time adult, competent Indians would be granted fee patents and control over their holdings. Lands loeft over after distribution of allotments were to be sold for th ebeneift of the tribe to finance development of their farms."" (49).  O-L thinks b/c she had powerful friends, the Act was passed on August 7, 1882.  She was appointed a ""special agent"" to oversee it.     This Act a precursor to the Dawes Several Act of 1887 (or 1886?).  (49)  The ACt iddn't work so well and she goes through this as well as Mead's assessment of the idea and of Fletcher  50-51

--  This sincere drafting of this Act nonetheless still had the solution of trying to destroy Indian customs.  O-L faults Fletcher for this. 52-53.  See also Hoxie, A Final Promise.  Doe she mention Fletcher??"
The Feminization of Academe,"<p>For notes see the entry for the whole book ""Beyond Separate Spheres""</p>"
"Cosmopolitanism & Solidarity: Studies in Ethnoracial, Religious, and Professional Affiliation in the United States","<p>Notes June 2011</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Preface</p>
<p>-----------</p>
<p>* First problem is that of solidarity.&nbsp; He cheesily calls it the ""we"" question.&nbsp; He defines it as ""an experiece of willed solidarity."" (xi) It is more he insists than simply a group classification...ie the wawy the word community is often used to specify say the gay community or the scientitific community and so on.&nbsp; (xi)&nbsp; He expalins this in a couple of ways.&nbsp; Solidarity requires ""conscious commitment"" (xi) or it is he sax ""more performative than community."" (xi) So then also ""a solidarity"" as he starts to use the word is not a ""community of fate"", that is a group of people whose lives have been touched by some set of historical contraints.&nbsp; (xii)&nbsp; The Jews are often described as a community of fate he says but they do not all feel the same level of solidarity.&nbsp; Or: ""Feminism is a solidarity, but womanhood is not."" (xii)&nbsp; He notes finally that ""global apitalist economy"" has shaped the problem of solidarity.&nbsp; (xiii-xiv) At the same time, in learned circles there is a tendency to describe all ""population groups"" as ""constructions.""&nbsp; (xiv)&nbsp; His point in all of this is to say that he think that ""among the great problems of the twenty-first century is the problem of willed affiliation, the problem of solidarity."" (xv) The nub of this is that th etendency to imagine all solidarities to be highly contingent as opposed to absolute and fixed has created a tension that is exacerbated by the rise of global capitalism and that has a social psychological character...&nbsp; That tension is between:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the needs for 1) a deep feeling of social belonging, enabling intimacy and promoting mutual exchange, and 2) a broad alliance, enabling mutual defense and facilitating a greater range of social and cultural experience.&nbsp; Solidariteies narrow enough to serve the need for belonging threaten to close people off from thelarger world of realities some of which may damage them if not engaged.&nbsp; Solidarities broaden enough to be consistently engaged with this larger wolrd threaten to become too braoad to sustain a sense of belonging.&nbsp; This tension between the impulse for concentration and the impulse for incocpration is heightened as eonomic and communications systems allow ostensibly distant forces to impinge on one's 'home.'&nbsp; Global wwarming is a convienient example of a threat to everyone that is difficult to engage from the point of view of any solidarity smaller than the species.&nbsp; But any solidarity capacious enough to act effectively on problem slocated in a large arena is poorly suited to satisfy the human need for belonging. And any solidarity tight enough to serve the need for belonign cannot be expected to respond effectively to challenges common to a larger and more heterogenous population. (xvi)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the same time, solidarity is also a question of political economy because solidarity is a ""commodity distributed by power."" (xvi) Ie nationalism has created state authority to reinforce certain national identities.</p>
<p>* Cosmpolitanism comes in beecause it is he says a ""family of responses to the problem of solidarity."" (xvii)&nbsp; He argues that it seeks to ""maximiye the authority of individual wills and to iminimiye that of ascribed idenitities."" (xvii)&nbsp; Cosmpolitanism has been critiqued int he past as being too insensitive to diversity and particularity and lcoal traditions as much as the realities of power, but recently there has been a new take on new forms of cosmpolitanism ie ""rooted cosmpolitnaism"" or other adjectives such as critical, discreptant, sitauted, patriotic and so on.&nbsp; (xviii).&nbsp; The point of these modifications is to distinguish cosmpolitanism and unviersalism.&nbsp; As he sees it and as he says he laid it out in his book <em>Postethnic America</em> ""we can...distinguish between a universalist will to find common ground and a cosmpolitan will to engage human diversity."" (xviii) He feels that cosmpolitans share with universalists a ""suspicion of enclosures,"" but also understancd ""the necessity of enclosures in their capacity as contingent and provisionally bounded domains in which people can form intimate and sustaining relationships, can create diversity, and can protect threatned constitutencies against outside forces."" (xviii)&nbsp; And he say that it ""urges each individual and collective unit to absorb as much varied experience as it can while retaining its capacity to achieve self-definition and to adacnce its own aims effectively."" (xviii)&nbsp; He insists that this type of cosmplitanism respects the difficulties that people have in forming bonds of solidarity with those that are perceived as different.&nbsp;</p>
<p>* He is carefulto point out that cosmpolitanism is not the same as pluralism.&nbsp; It is he says ""more liberal in style; it is more oriented to the individual, and supposes that individuals will be simultaneously affiliated with a number of groups, including civic and religious communiteis as all as communities of descent."" (xix) By contrast, ""Pluralism is more conservative in style; it is oriented to the preexisting group, and it is likely to ascribe to each individual a primary identiy within a single community of descent.&nbsp; Pluralists are more concerned to protect and perpetuate cultures of groups already well established at the time the ideal of pluralism is invoked, while cosmpolitanisms are more inclinced to encourage the voluntary formations of new communities of wider scope made possible by altered histirical circumstances and demographic mixing. "" (xix-xx)&nbsp; In his book <em>Postethnic America</em> he defined cosmpolitnaism as ""affiliation by revocable consent."" (xxi)</p>
<p>* He believes that the increasing popularity of cosmpolitanism is a result of the ""world-historical events"" that have made the ""old, racialist forms of anti-racism"" less valuable, ie global capitalism, inreased international migration, belief in the constructed character of all identities.&nbsp; A tone of people have b een writing on cosmpolitanism he thinks and he gives names: Alexander Aleinikoff, Kwame Anthony Appiah, Roger Baubock, Ulrich Beck, Thomas Bender, Sezly Benhabib, Rogers Brubaker, Craig CAlhoun, Phen Cheah, Amos Elon, Paul Gilroy, Amy gutmann, David Held, Jennifer Hochschild, Michael Ignatieff, Mary Kaldor, Bruno Latour, John Lie, Bharati Mukherjee, Bhikhu Parekh, Ross Posnock, Bruce Robbins, Salman Rushdie SamuelScheffler, RRogers Smith, Amartya Sen, Werner Sollors, and Jeremy Waldron.&nbsp; He summarizes what he thinks these writers have in common: ""if you do not take on as much of the world as yu can, the wworld will come to you, and on terms tover which you will have even less control than youd did previously."" (xxii)</p>
<p>* Lastly he think that the US is of ""special interest"" here.&nbsp; It has been a ""major site for many of the processes that now produce the problem of solidarity elsewhere."" And it has been a ""testing ground"" for responses.&nbsp; He puts it this way: ""The more contingent become the groups to which individuals through the world belong, the more relevant the history of the United States appears to be."" (xxii)&nbsp;</p>"
Lost Manhood Found: Male Sexual Impotence and Victorian Culture in the United States,"p. 35 Critique of ""crisis of masculinity"" theory

There is a widely recognized notion of ""crisis of masculinity"" in the 1890s, when many men felt they had lost their manhood.  Mumford thinks that detailed studies of sexuality may give specificity to that theory rather than disproving it.

A Social History of Anthropology in the United States,"p.024 -  Mound Builders discussion

Continued focuson native Americansin 1850s, new focus on the mound builders.  First volume in Smithsonian's publication series was E.g. Squier and Edwin Davis's <I>Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley</i> (1848) about the moundbuilders.    Davis and Squier felt that contemporary Indians and their ancestors were not capable of building such a thing.  (24)  They felt contemporary peoples to be hunters and foragers not agriculturalists, and thus they supported the Lockean logic justifying claims to Indian lands.  (24)  

New opinions in the 1850s.  Schoolcraft, and Samuel Haven (secretary of Antiquarian Society) thought they could have been built by people at the ""barabarian level of culture."" (26)  Haven and Schoolcraft emphasized that there were no mounds and antiquitiees west of Mississippi, helping to undermine Indian claims in that region.  (26)  

Then Morgan...he revived a monogenist type argument, emphasizing unity basedon kinship structures and believed that the American Indians had come from Asia and origins may be in Turanian speakers of that continent.  (Haven and Schoolcraft also thought this).  (27)  He compared them with kindship structures of the Tamil and Dravidian tribes of South India and found they were th esame (27)  So he found there was a single but diverse human species (27)    He believed that the kinship similarity also signaled a biological similarity.   I.e. he linked culture and heredity.  (27)  Patterson then continues to explain in a very useful and brief way Morgan's ideas (27-32), but the point is that Morgan introduces this question of historical development which understoodthe male middle class as the advancing wave of historical progres....see great Bruce Trigger quoteon 33: ""they wer eplease to view themseleves as a wave of progress that was inherent in human nature and perhapseven in the constitution of the universe.""

(51) That sounds a lot like Boas to me when Boas is saying how all these myths have no relationship to the natural world except that they capture the sense of awe nature inspires in us... &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">So what is the significance of this observation for this paper? &nbsp;For one, it gives me a more historically contemporaneous way to describe Boas' appraoch to myth than saying he was a proto-postmodernist/post-structuralist as I did in the dissertation. &nbsp;Secondly, it might be a nice way to point out how Bunzl doesn't quite get it right: ie Boas is not so squarely in this German historicist tradition... </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">What is complex here, though, is if Boas is in this tradition, what of his commitment to science and truth? &nbsp;For Nietzsche this goes in radically anti-foundational directions. &nbsp;Truth says nothing about reality. &nbsp;Megill quotes one of his most famous phrase: ""[truth is] a mobile army of metaphors, metonymies, anthropomorphisms: in short a sum of human relations which have been poetically and rhetorically intsenfied, transposed, adorned, and after long usage seem to a nation fixed, canonical, and binding; truths are illusions of which one has forgotten that this is what they are; metaphors which have become worn out and have lost their sensual power; coins which have lost their pictures and now are no longer of account as coins but merely as metal.""

(53) &nbsp;Both these seem to put Boas closer to Nietzsche than Kant to my mind. Indeed, this word dissimulation reminds me a bit of the part where Boas describres the disintegration of myths through diffusion and integration. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">Ultimatley, for N, truth is a not reality, but this changes teh concept of what a liar is...a liar is someone who attempts to treat concepts as though they were real, who uses, in N's words, ""the valid designations, the words, in order to make the unreal appear as real..."" (54) &nbsp;So the linguistic realm becomes important as an aesthetic realm in which humans play with concepts. &nbsp;And finally, in N's world, men do not hate deception, Megill says, but only certain types of description that produce ""evile, hostile consequences...""

(65) &nbsp;For N, both art and myth are a ""fundamental impulse of man"". &nbsp;In Megill's words, ""his impulse toward the formation of metaphors, toward the continually creative substitution of one element for another within his language."" (65) &nbsp;That impulse has in modern culture ""been overlaid by a rigid structure of concepts, but it has not thereby been defeated or even subdued, for it 'seeks for itself a new realm of action and another river-bed, and finds it in Mythos and more generally in art.'"" (65) &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">* With regard to myth, as opposed to art, Megill says there is a bigger difference between mature and immature N. &nbsp;So he wants to look at the shift that takes place in N's ""middle"" or ""positivistic"" period. &nbsp;Basically, N turns away from his celebration of the artist--definitely distancing himself from the Romantics--due in part to his biographical dissapointment with Wagner at the first great festival and Bayreuth, so instead he begins to celebrate the scientists, seeing the artist as someone whose artistic impulse led them away from serious intellectual engagement or the pursuit of truth toward an almost childish ""belief in gods and daemons, to a spiritualization of nature, to a hatred of science..."" (67) &nbsp;He is not, however, leaving behind his sense that ""logic is fiction"" that Megill had attributed to him in Ch.1. &nbsp;Likewise, his ideal is still immediate contact with ""reality"". &nbsp;But since that contact is iimpossible (agian sse ch.1), ""he is forced to think in terms of a rigidly dichotomous realtion between &nbsp;'knowledge' and 'reality,' in which man creates a reality of his own precisely because he cannot know reality as it actually is."" (69) &nbsp;Then so his view of modern scientific conceptions of the world is that on some level it is myth also, and here we arrive at a passage that really reminds me of Boas: Nietzsche suggests that what we now call the world is in fact the result of a 'crowd of errors and fantasies whcih arose gradually in the general development of organic being...and are now inherited by us as the accumulated treasure of all the past."" (69, that is from Human, All too Human) &nbsp;This mythological character of modern conceptions of the world is however not a bad thing, as Megill puts it these ""errors are not only inescapable but are also...a benefit to mankind. &nbsp;Indeed, our sympathy depends upon them, for it only such errors (above all, the suppositions of equality and of identity) that have allowed the development of human reason."" (69) &nbsp;Point here too is that even in this positivisitic phase N sees modern science as art. (70)</span></div>"
"Vigorous Male and Aspiring Female: Poetry, Personality, and Culture in Edward Sapir and Ruth Benedict","<p>Gender and ""Hardness""  A nice part of Handler's argument here is that he is talking about gender in relation to this ideal of hardness.  His first point is that given this ideal, which he thinks Benedict also is interested in through Walter Pater (100-102), Benedict has a harder time with it because as he says at the outset ""'hardness' has obvious sexual implications..."" (97) But if Benedict had trouble with it, as Handler shows in his discussion of the tensions between Sapir and Benedict over poetry resulting in the Sapir's ""Sex Problem in America"" paper (102-116), Sapir also had trouble with it, and was not always sure how ""hard"" he should be as Handler shows on 110 and his ultimate feelig of ailure as a poet: ""Sapir's poetic voice tended to be soft and sentiental, one the one hand, or aloof and distanced, on the other.  In any case, it lacked the intensity and 'hardness' that were in demand but that he equated with 'bluff'.  As I will show, 'bluff' or Sapir was symptomatic of spurious personality, epitmoized in the distorted sexuality of women who aspired to hardness."" (110)  That quote really begins to show the complexity of the matter and Sapir's own confusion and contradition over it.  He himself was not hard, but he despised women that tried to get hard.</p>"
Culture: The Anthropologist's Account,"p. 10 Culture as Explanation of Failure of Modernization/Globalization?

Kuper makes a frankly strange argument here.  In the pages before (5-7) he has
given a very brief account of the rise of culture in the conflicts over civilization and kultur in the era of enlightenments.  Now he moves to the modern period and in the first pages makes a strange assertion as to the reason culture emerged into discussion:

""In the twentieth century, the idea of a progressive, scientific world-civilization was translated into the theory of modernization, and then the theory of globalization.  In the short run, culture was a barrier to modernization (or industrialization, or globalization), but modern civilization would in the end trample over local, less efficient traditions.  Culture was invoked when it became necessary to expalin why epople were clinging to irrational goals and self-destructive strategies...  Culture was the fallback, to explain apparently irrational behavior.  culture also accounted for the disappointing outcome of many political reforms."" (10)

There is a certain truth to this -- it is reflected for instance in the simple version of my War Chapter -- but it is also a highly reductive explanation.  Or one might say that it excludes the second part of culture's purpose.  1) Culture was used to explain irrational thought and thus 2) it was a term that focused and brought to the fore a new language for discussing the role of tradition and symbolic systems in our lives...   Kuper seems to disregard the second part as though it were a priori ridiculous.  Cf. with his suggestion in the introduction that problems should be addressed by their specific names and not through culture...this suggests this more deliberate, rational, instrumental form of political activity that I ultimately trace in the last chapters of my dissertation..."
Selection from Section IX. On the empirical use of the regulative principle,"<p>General Notes</p>
<p>(This section is wh<strong>&nbsp;</strong>ere Kant is dealing with the relationship between two forms of causality, one in the realm of freedom and the other in the realm of nature.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III. Resolution of the cosmological idea of the totality of the derivation of occurrences in the world from their causes</p>
<p>* Two ways to think of causality: ""either according to <strong>nature</strong> or from <strong>freedom</strong>."" (532)</p>
<p>* The first kind, that having to do with nature or ""the world of sense"" is a ""causality of appearnaces"" that rest on ""temporal conditions."" (532)</p>
<p>* The second, the causality of freedom, is ""transcendental"".&nbsp; It is a kind of causality that is distinct in part because it is has the ""faculty of beginning a state <strong>from itself</strong>"" (533).&nbsp; It does not in other words ""stand under another cause determining it in time in accordance with the law of nature."" (533)&nbsp; This is why it is transcendental.&nbsp;</p>
<p>* It is based on this transcendental idea of freedom that the ""[f]reedom in the practical sense"" is grounded. (533)&nbsp; Ie in the idea of ""independence of the power of&nbsp; choice from <strong>necessitation </strong>by impulses of sensibility."" (533)&nbsp; Where sensibility refers to a choices in the realm of nature that are determined ""<strong>pathologically affected</strong> (through moving-causes of sensiblity)..."" (533)&nbsp; Ie the impulses of sensibiility reflect an ""animal power of choice"" and not the ""human power of choice"" that is not rendered necessary by ""sensibilty"" but is instead based on the ""faculty of determining oneself from oneself, independently of necessitation by sensible impulses."" (533)</p>
<p>* If all causality, he says, were ""in the world of sense"" ie natural causation, then this would involve the ""abolition of transcendental freedom"" and also ""practical freedom.""&nbsp; (533-534).&nbsp; Why is that?&nbsp; To imagine that the world as we perceive it is all the wrold, he says, is to imagine (as had some empricisits) that ""apperances were things in themslves, and hence space and time were the forms of things in themselves"".&nbsp; (534)&nbsp; And if that were the case then causality would belong to that series of events in space-time.&nbsp; But the kind of freedom he's talking about exists outside of that series because it beings from things in themselves. (533-534)</p>
<p>* So the question he's facing he thinks is whether first of all a causality of freedom exists at all, and if so if it ""can exist together with the universality of the natural law of causality...[whether] every effect in the world must arise <strong>either</strong> from nature <strong>or&nbsp; </strong>freedom, or whether instead <strong>both</strong>, each in a different relation, might be able to take place simultaneously in one and the same occurrence."" (534)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* If, as the empiricists assume, there is an ""<strong>absolute reality</strong> of appearance"" then ""freecom cannot be saved.""&nbsp; Because nature, ie the causality of apperances, is a ""completely determining cause, sufficient in itself, of every occurence, and teh condition for the occurrence is alays contained only in the series of appearances that, along with their effect, are necessary under the law of nature."" (535)</p>
<p>* But if apperances ""do not count for any more than they are...namely not things in themselves but only for mere representations connected in accordance with empirical laws"" then, Kant says, ""they themselves must have grounds that are not appearances..."" )(535)&nbsp; This he calls an ""intellegible cause."" (535)&nbsp; This cause is outside the series of causes of apperances in nature, even though its ""effects"" are encountered in the ""series of empirical conditions."" (535)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* What he means by ""intelligible"" is <em>that </em>""in an object of sense which is not itself appearance."" (535) So if objects have a faculty that is not the way in which the thing exists in the realm of appearances then an object can be condiered as&nbsp; ""intelligible in its action as a thing in itself, and as sensible in the effects of that action as an appearance in the wrold of sense."" (535)&nbsp; Kant also says then that an object's causality has an ""empirical character"" ie through which its action as appearances can be understood and ""intelligible character"" ""through which it is indeed the cause of those actiuons as apperacnes, but which does not stand under any conditons of sensibility and is not itself apperance."" (536)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* He also notes that this ""acting subject"" or ""intelligible character"" is not also under the condition of time.&nbsp; And it can also not be ""known immediately, because we cannot perceive anyting except insofar as it appear..."" (536)&nbsp;</p>
<p>*&nbsp; <strong>Now he makes an important statement about the relationship of the intellible character of the object and its empirical.&nbsp; He says that in its empirical character as an appearance the the subject would ""be subject to the causal connection, in accordance with all the laws of determination; and to the extent it would be nothing but a part of the world of sense, whose effects, like those of any other appearance, would flow inevitably from nature..."" (537)</strong></p>
<p><strong>* But at the same time in its intelligible character the same subject is not subject to determination by in the realm of sensiblity.&nbsp; (537)&nbsp; Even though we can ""have nothing more than merely the general concept of it [the intelligible character]"" (537), insofar at is is a ""noumenon"" he says, then it is also ""free of all influences of sensibility and determination bhy appearances..."" (537)&nbsp; This means that as a noumenon ""it begins its effects in the sensible world from itself, without its action beginning in itself..."" The point he's trying to make is that this intelligible character can provoke ""from itself"" an action that appears in the world of appearances and in conformity with the laws of that realm, without that meaning that effectts in the world of senses, in general, begin from themselves (ie are their own cause) because in the empirical world all effects are caused by something else in a series.</strong></p>
<p>* So now the problem that he wants to solve should be clear.&nbsp; The idea is can you understand taht there is a realm of causality in freedom where things in themselves are their own causes, at the same time as in the realm of apperances that we known empirically things are always caused in a series according to the laws of natural causation as we can define them. (537)&nbsp; He thinks the answer is yes, as he sketched in particualr on 536-537.&nbsp; And the fact that he thinks the answer is yes means also that ""freedom and nature,e ach in its full significance, would both be found in the same actions, simultaneously and without any contradiction, according to whether one compares them with thier intelligible or their sensible cause."" (537)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Another key point here is that Kant sees this as a ""transcendental problem""; that is, a problem of philsophy and reason, and not a psychological problem because it is a problem otuside the bounds of experience.&nbsp; See short paragaraph mid page on 534.</p>
<p><em>From 537 on he now moves beyodn the ""silhouette"" of the solution to the ""course of reason"" that one needs to really solve it... </em></p>
<p>* He again explains how the idea of causality according to the law of nature is a causality in time, in which he effect is caused by one preceding it.&nbsp; But then he asks does it need to be the case that the causality of the cause of an effect in this realm of appearances is always or ""solely"" empirical?&nbsp; ""Is it not rather possible that although for every effect in appearance there is required a connection with its cause in accordance with the laws of empirical causality, this empirical causality itself, without the least interruption of its connection with natural cause, could nevertheless be an effect of a causality taht is not empirical, but rather intelligibile, i.e. an original action of ac ause in regard to appearances, which to that extent is not appearance but in accordance with this faculty intelligible, even though otherwise, as a link in the chain of nature, it must be counted entirely as belonging to the wrold of sense?"" (539)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* To sum up: In other words, why can't both forms of causality coincide and support each other? He's saying why can't we imagine that there are causes in nature but also causes on a transcedent level even if we can't know them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Subjects could be part of a law of causation in nature, then, and also ""contain certain conditoin that, if one would ascend from empirical objects to transcendental ones, would have to be regarded as merely intelligible"".&nbsp; (ie not appearance) (539)&nbsp; His point is in part that these two kinds of causation exist without interfering with each other, esp since we can't have&nbsp; any absolute knowledge of the intelligible cahracter of a thing.: ""...if we follow the rule of nature only in that which might be the cause among appearances, then we need not worry aobut what sort of ground is thought for these appearances and their connection in the transcendental subject, which is empirically unknown to us.&nbsp; This intelligible ground does not touch the empirical questions at all..."" (539)</p>
<p>[Note: you could see how the Americans, e.g. James Marsh, could avoid the limits of knowledge part, and imagine this to be one great perfect unity...that we can known, through God! ]</p>
<p>* Now going deeper into the problem he applies it to humans.&nbsp; Humans are he says ""one of the appearances in the world of sense."" (539)&nbsp; As such, they are also one of the ""natural causes"" whose causality ""must stand under empirical laws"" like all other natural things. (540) .&nbsp; But the human being is also ""knows himself also through apperception, and indeed in actions and inner determinations which cannot be accounted atall among impressiosn of sense..."" (540)&nbsp;<strong> So the human being is one part empirical and one part intelligibile.&nbsp; The latter part of the human has to do with this faculties for ""Undersanding and reason</strong>""--and <strong>these faculties operate with ideas and concepts,</strong> Kant says.&nbsp; Ie here were ware in the realm of noumena.&nbsp; (540).&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Reason has to do with a kind of causality having to do with what ""ought"" to e.&nbsp; and this is a ""species of necessity"" that has nothing to do with the causality of nature.&nbsp; (540)&nbsp; ""In anutre the understanding can cognize only what exists, orhas been, or will be.&nbsp; It is impossible that something in it ought to be other than what, in all these time-relations, it in fact is; indeed, the ought, if one has merely the course of nature before one's eyes, has no significance whatever.&nbsp; We cannot ask at all what ought to happen in anture, any more tha we can ask what properties a circle ought to have; but we must rather ask what happens in nature, or what properties a circle has."" (540)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* The ought then expresses a ""possible action"" that must also be possible under ""natural conditions.""&nbsp; (540)&nbsp; Yet reason does not ""give in to those grounds which are empirically given"" (541) Kant says.&nbsp; It ""decclares actino to be necessary that yet have not occurred and perhaps will not occur, nevertheless presupposing of all such actions that reason could have causality in relation to them..."" (541)&nbsp; If you apply this again to humans, to say that human reason has a causality that conforms to the law of nature would be to say that ""there is no freedom"" because only actions that were possibly in the law of natural causation could occur.&nbsp; This he says is waht happens when you look at humans from this perspective of the law of natural causation according to the ""moving causes of his actions psychologically."" (542)&nbsp; But if you consider the samea ctions in realtion to reason you get a different view.&nbsp; Here is is particularly good:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...if we consider the very same actions [that have been considered from a psychological pointf of view of he law of natural causation] in relation to reason...in order to explain them as regards their origin, but insofar as reason is the casue of producing them by themselves--in a word, if we comapre them with reason in a practical respect -- then we find a rule and order that is entirely other than the natural order.&nbsp; For perhaps everything that has happened in the course of nature, and on empirical grounds inevitably had to happen, nevertheless ought not to have happened.&nbsp; At many times, however, we find, or at least believe we have found, that the ideas of reason have actually proved their causality in regard to the actions of&nbsp; human beings as appearances, and that therefore tehse actions have occurred not through empirical causes, no, but because they were determined by the grounds of reason. (542)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>* He now tries again to work out the relationsships between these two forms of causality.&nbsp; How can it be that an action that is caused by reason--by the ought--is also in the realm of appearances.&nbsp; It is reason that determines the empriical cahracter he says; ""The empirical character is once again determined in the intelligible character (in the modes of thought)."" (542)&nbsp; Since we can't know the origin of reason (because it originates in the subject tiself, the thing in itself, which we cannot know) then we are ""not aquainted"" with its original character although it is ""indicated through appearances..."" (542)&nbsp; This form of causation through reason, this intelligible faculty, does not operate in time because it is outside the realm of appearances which operates in space-time.&nbsp; so It ""is not subject to the form of time, and hence cont subjec tto the conditions of the temporal sequence.""&nbsp; It dies not ""start working aa certain time in producinng an effect."" (542)&nbsp; It does in a sense not even begin.&nbsp; BUT this intelligible causes emanating from reason ""this very same cause in another relation also belongs to the series of appearances."" (543)&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>* So reason has both a negative and a postiive relationship to the causality of nature and appearnces.&nbsp; 1) Negative in that reason, because it is indepednent of all prior causation, can ""only be regarded negatively, as independence from empriical conditions...""&nbsp; (543)&nbsp; Thus Kant says ""Reason is thus the persisting condition of all voluntary actions under which the human being appers.""&nbsp; 2) And the positive connection is that Because ""in reason itself nothing begins"" but it is able to begin something in the temporal series of appearances: i.e. ""positively by a faculty of beginning a series of occurences from itself, in such a way that in reason itself nothing begins, but as the unconditioned condition of every voluntary action, it allows of now condition prior to it in time, wehreas its effect begins in the series of appearance, but can never constitute an absolutely first beginning in this series.""

The Clash of Civilizations?,"p.023-24 What Huntington means by ""civilization.""

Huntington first says that: ""A civilization is a cultural entity."" He says that a village, an ethnic group, a nationality, a religion, ""all have distinct cultures at different levels of cultural heterogeneity."" (24) (23-4)  A civilization, however, is not just any cultural entity.  It is one of the highest order.  Germans and Italians may share a European culture, so they are independently not civilizations.  ""A civilization is thus the highest cultural grouping of people and the broadest level of cultural identity people have short of that which distinguishes humans from other species.""  (24)  Examples of these for Huntington are as follows: ""Arabs, Chinese and Westerners, however, are not part of any broader cultural entity.  They constitute civilizations."" (24)

He further argues that these civilizations have their subdivisoins (or don't, in the case of China which he quotes Lucian Pye as saying is a ""civilization pretending to be a state"" (24)).  The West he says as ""two major variants, European and North American""; Islam has Arab, Turkic and Malay divisions.  

Finally he notes that these entities are fungible, they rise, fall, divide and merge, and dissappear.  (24)"

Legitimation Crisis,"<p>Notes November 2014:</p>
<p>&gt; Prepping for trying to write a second and expanded draft of metacrisis idea. Going in my sense of this book from conversations with others is that this is Habermas being more radical than he later became in the Theory of Communiative Action. Here he examines crisis tendencies in late capitalism, and not it's stabilizing mechanisms. It may be a book characteristic of the 70s, when the fissures in the social democratic systems created after the war became visible. I also remember a comment made by David Strecker that this was one of the last attempts to talk about crisis, perahps in the 20th century, in the critical sociology tradition that comes out of the Frankfurt School. And it failed, I think he said, or was deemed unworthy because of the problem of situating a crisis crtiique that is not also normative, and therefore based on specific assumptions? I dont' know that I understood perfectly David's point but we'll see. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thomas McCarthy's Introduction:</p>
<p>&gt; I'm going through this a bit because Habermas is hard to grasp.</p>
<p>* Basically McCarthy describes this work as having the goal, parlty quoting H himself, of the ""'clarification' of very general structures of hypotheses' relating to the dynamics and development of contemporary capitalism. Habermas aim' is no less than that of survyeying most of the important literature on advacned capitalist society and organizing it around a continuous line of argument."" (viiii). McCarthy emphasizes in his introduction that this is a difficult text and partly because it is wroking through, as he noted, so many different literatures on advanced capitalism. Three of these key contexts are: 1) Writings in the Marxist tradition; 2) The dimension of ""systems theory"" and in particular his critqiue of Parsons and Luhmann. and 3) his own project, already begun, i.e. his ""theory of cummunicative competence."". McCarthy says already on page x that he will sepdn the rest of the time expalining this latter dimension as that is the least well known in the English speaking context.</p>
<p>* Pages x-xiii, McCarthy works quickly through some of the work of the critical theorists of the Frankfurt School in order to place Habermas' project. The division between moral and thereotical knowledge he begins was one that critical social theory could not abide because it was focused on overcoming that division, and the devision between theory and practice. This is the project of the Frankfruth School carried out in particular by Horkheimer and Marcuse in the *Zeitschrift feur Sozialforschung*. (x) Horkheimer starts this by taking up Hegel's dialectics. Knowledge is not merely transitory but its negation, its finitude, is part of a total system of truth. That was Hegel. But that doesn't work for&nbsp; materialist critique because it is part of an idealist system. Hegel thinks this is all an inner development of spirit. Horkheimer then seeks to ""radicalize"" Hegel by giving up the teleological (theological) view of progress, by distancing himself from any sort of totalizing perspective, by and accepting that&nbsp; all critique is finite and located in actual history. (xi)</p>
<p>* So then how can critical theory legitimate its own standpoint? For Horkheimer and others critical theory was about the capacity of individuals to exercise a rational will in order to take control of history and achieve a more rational organization of society. Moreover, as Horkheimer says on a quote on xii, the opint here is that indiviudals do not always grasp the problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The viewpoints which critical theory draws from historical analysis as the goals of human activity, especially the idea of a reasonable organization of society that will meet the needs of the whole community, are immaentn in huma work, but are not correctly grasped by individuals or by the common mind. (xii)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But how could practitioners of this kind of critique know that their views were not just another experession of particular interest, either culture-bound, class-bound or otherwise? But Here he thinks that Horkheimer and others in the *Zeitschrift* did not sufficiently establish their point of view. He accusses them of rejecting Hegel through Marx, and taking up the ""notion of the coincidence of reason"" (?), without dealing with what it mean to reject Hegel's idealism. McCarthy: ""...what is required, and what is lacking int he *Zeitschrift* essays, is a philosophical elucidation of thought on materialist presuppositions, which, while overcoming Hegel's idealism, does not fall below the level of insight he achieved."" (xiii)</p>
<p>* This then is where McCarthy starts his discussion of Habermas' project vv the Frankfurt SChool. Habermas characterizes langauge as a ""universal medium"" alongside ""work"" and ""domination."" (xiii). But conemporary analyses and idealism and hermeneutics have not adequatley understood language. What is needed is to understand it in terms of a ""universal pragmatics that exhibits the normative basis of all communication *and* explains the possiblity of systemtatically distorted communication."" (xiii, McCarthy's words).</p>
<p>* So then McCarthy wants to draw together Habermas' ""theory of communicative competenece"". (xiii) He does so in the rest of this sub-section I. (xiii-xviii). Key point here is in part that I think this is where Habermas starts to integrate that work of the anglophone analytical tradition (wittegenstein et al) in thinking about ""language games."" His point in very brief form as I glean it from a too quick reading here is this: there are a series of language games involved in a normal speech act: ""claims that the utterance is understandable, that its propositional conctnet is true, and that the speaker is sincere in uttering it, and that it is right or appropriate for the speaker to be performing the speech act."" (xiii-xiv). Mostly these validity claims are met, bu tthere are situation in which they are not. Then there are some ways of resolving those situations by entering into a kind of discussion aimed at resolving those disputes, i.e. discourse. This McCarthy describes quickly on xiv.</p>
<p>* Now, on the other hand, Habermas knows that although we know that most of the time the ""model of pure communiciative action"" that he describes does not hold, we ""cannot avoid counterfactually proceeding as if"" they did. (Habermas quoted on xiv). How can this be explained? Well Habermas thinks because it is possible to develop a theory of the way communication is systematically distorted. What that means, basically, is that there are ""ruling systems of norms"" that exist that act anchor certain beliefs and serves as ""systematic barriers to will-forming communciation."" (Habermas quoted from great quote on xv). Basically then ruling systems of norm that support a ""fiction,"" and also prevent its being discovered as such. (xv) But at this point Habermas has merely arrived at the point that McCarthy says the Frankfurt school had arrived at: i.e. that individuals falsely assess the situation they are in, fail to through their own will formulate an analysis that would point the way to a more rational organizaiton of society. (xv)</p>
<p>* Habermas still needs to supply a method for determining what is a fiction, and what is not. (This does seem to me to be a quesiton also at the core of analytical philosophy: i.e. what kind of statements are true and which not?) But in doing so, he can't just suggest some criteria; that would just produce a circle, because then that criteria would need to be justified and so on. He therefore takes the pragmatisits route: what kind of pragmatic speech situation creates the conditions in which systematic distortion can be eliminated? McCarthy says that his thesis is that ""the structure is free from contraint only when for all participants there is a symmetrical distribution of chances ot select and employ speech acts, when there is an effective equality of chaces to assume disalogue roles."" (xvi-xvii). I.e. this can only work if there is a situaiton of where unlimited discussion is possible, and where there there are not constrains from domination, whether conscious or uncionscious (i.e. neuroses or ideology). (xvii) This means that ""the conditions for the ideal discourse are connected with condition for an ideal for of life; they include linguistic conceptionalizations of the traditional ideas of freedom and justice. 'Truth,' therefore, cannot be analyzed independently of 'freedom' and 'justice.' (xvii) (!!!) This is key. This gets the basic gist. McCarthy, however, somes it up nicely again right at the end; ""His arguemnt is, simply, that the emancipated form of life that is the goal of criticla theory is inherent in the notio nof truth: it is anticipated in every act of communication."" (xviii).</p>
<p>* Okay, now in section II of this intro McCarthy sets up the context a bit more widely of the text itself vv Marxist critqiue and the history of capitalism. First he goes through Marx, xviii-xx; then the Frankfurt School and discusses the Dialectic of the Enlightenment text. Point is vv Marx that there was a tension in Marx between a sensitivity to the functioning of ideology versus a kind of reductive economism. This is traced very nciely and one can really see the tension in the quote on xix, and the way McCarthy draws it out. Then there is the quesiton: well how did this tension get resolved in ""official"" Marxism? HIs answer is thought an emphasis on the reductive side. But then this is what the Frankfruth School was correcting in their focus on culture. Moreover, post-WWI capitalism seemed to demand a different approach. capitalism was no longer of the liberal variant. There was an internventionist state, the rationalization and bureucratization of social institutions, interdependence of science and technology, ""reificiation"" of consciousness.. (not sure what the altter is). This is what came under critique in Dialectic of Enlightenment. Lukacs had begun this already. McCarthy explains their arguemnt this way:</p>
<p>""For Marx, natural science was the paradigm of a mode of thinking that had constantly proved its truth in practice; itwas philosophy that had to be overcome. For Horkheimer and Adorno, it was the contrary: the critique of scientism was the precondition of restoring Marxist theory as critique. Philosophical idealism, in which th eideals of reason and freedom were kept alive--albet in a distored form--was repalced by positivistic materialism as the chief enemy of critical thought. The critique of instrumetnal reason became the fundamental task of critical social theory. For in creasing the objective possibility of a truly free society, the progressive mastery of nature through science and technology simultaneously transformed the potential subjects of emancipation. The reification of consciousness was the price paid for the progressive liberation from material necessity."" (xxj)</p>

"What Happened to Kant in Neo-Kantian Aesthetics? Cohen, Cohn, and Dilthey","<p># Paul Guyer, ""What Happened to Kant in Neo-Kantian Aesthetics? Cohen, Cohn, and Dilthey"" <em>The Philosophical Forum</em>, v.39, no.2 (2008): 143-176</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Neo-Kantianism must be understood Guyer says in two intellectual contexts: 1) A push back against the speculative or ""absolute"" idealism of Hegel, Schelling and Fichte that emerged in the post-Kantian period, and 2) a desire to try to ""ground philosophy on empirical pscyhology by Helmholtz and others that had been a previous response to post-Kantian idealism."" (143)</p>
<p>* But neo-Kantians did not necessarily stick to the ideas of Kant, and this was the case with their aesthetics. (143-144)</p>
<p>* He characterizes the aesthetics of Bohen and Cohn as having a common character, despite their different version of neo-Kantianism. That approach wsa an altternative both to Schelling and Hegel's ""speculative, metaphysical aesthetics"" and the ""psychological aesthetics"" of Helmholtz and Fechner. (144)</p>
<p>* Their appraoch was also reflective a ""general tendency of aesthetics in their own times"" and this is interesting he thinks because it may alogn with other related works such as those by Edward Bullough and R.G. Collingwood ""constitute an enduring contibute to the field of aesthetics."" (144)</p>
<p>## Cohen's Aesthetic Theory</p>
<p>* Guyer traces two key assumptions of Cohen's argument.</p>
<p>1. is that following Kant he sees the cognitive faculty as having ""two domains"" one in nature and the other in relation to freedom (morality).&nbsp; He sees science and morality as differeing in terms of the ""direction of consciousenss"": in nature the direction is twoard a reality indepdnent of our consciousness, that is to explain that reality; whereas in moality it is not twoard such an external reality but instead toward ""the future of reailty."" (Cohehn quoted on 149). In Guyer's words: ""...in morality the points is not to form our concepts ot fit nature, but to transform nature to realize our moral goals."" (149) BUT Cohen also holds, unlike Kant, that to understand aesthetic experience and art we suol dhave to know ""what a third direction of consciousness ould be that could be the goal of aesthetic experience and the production of art."" (149)</p>
<p>2. is that Cohen's mode of argumentation is based on Kant's ""analytical"" style of argument in&nbsp; *The Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics*, which is not how Kant had ultiamtely described aethetic expereince in the third Critique where he'd used the ""synthetic""&nbsp; style. The distinction is between (the synthetic) mode of describing how a certain kind of judgement (ie scientici, moral, aesthetic) is possible at all, vertsus the (the analytic) whihc Guyer says starts from the assumption that ""fact"" that such forms of judgement exist and then tries to find the rules or laws juding those domains of judgement.</p>
<p>* Guyer thinks it may be due to the use of the analytic method by Cohen that his aesthetics reflects the contemporary appraoch of his period and also ends up being more like our contemporary aesthetics than Kant's. (150)</p>
<p>* So what then is Cohen's idea of aesthetics.</p>
<p>1. Art he thinks is the ""expression of the feelings associated with our reprenstations of nature and our own volitions and actino--that is, science and moraity--that are not captured by the concepts of those two domains, adn taht the pleaure of beauty is the pleasure of enjoying those feelings."" (150)</p>
<p>2. Feeling he think is the wrapped up in an initial level of consciousness: so that as Guyer writes ""feeling"" is 'in the first place, this consciousness of being-conscious, and second, everything about this consciousness taht will not be captured by our subsequence conceptualization of our consciousness, whether that take the form of a conceptualized representation [of nature] of an object or of a determination of the [moral] will."" (151) See Cohen quote on 151-2 that expresses it pretty clearly. Guyer describes this as a ""two-level view"" (152)</p>
<p>3. So the unique direction of aesthetic consciousness is oward these ""primordial feelings of becoming conscious that precede determinate sensation and coneptualization of objects and dterminations of the are not taken up into them."" (152) In Cohen's words:</p>
<p>&gt; No single object, even were it the highest, counts as the content that is to be determine [in aesthetic experience and art], but consciousness itself grasped in the totality of its directions, and this totality organized as proportion; this interweaving of all objects in a mere relationship is the aesthetic content. And this interweaving of objects itself forms the new object: feeling as feeling, and not as an annex of sensation and representation. (152)</p>
<p>4. VV the pleasure or displeasure of art, Guyer seems to think that Cohen's ideas are not so well worked out. He says that Cohen seems to think that 1) pleasure and pain are one part of the primordial consciousness, and that 2) are is something taht captures this one dimenision and then communicates it to the audience of art. (153) Guyer thinks this is not well worked out, though, brecause it presumes a theory of empathy that is not worked out.</p>
<p>5. Regardless, Guyer thinks that Cohen's idea is basically that pleasure results from primoridal feelings because aesthetic experience is not directed at any partiuclar objective content. That is, it is only directed at the ""motility"" of conscousness -- that is its capacity for spontaneous movement. Cohen's words: ""the feeling of animation and of the disposition of consciousness to activity in general."" (153)</p>
<p>6. This idea of aesthetic pleasure as being linked to the animation of consciousenss that goes toward no particular object is where Cohen connects his ideas to Kant's notion of free-play. But Guyer thinks that while Cohen is accurate in identifying Kant as a source of the idea that there is pleausre in the free play of the mind (although he accusses Cohen of being a German nationailst in not citing e.g. Alexsander Gerard's *Essay on Taste* (1759) as anothe rsource) BUT he does notes that Cohen's notion of aesthetic pleasure as constituting something *distinct* that is not expressed in partical or theoretical concepts. Kant does not ""reocoginze the existence of other aspects of primordial consciousness"" in this way. He simply sees ""the paradigmatic content of art is *ideas* of pure reason that is , typically, moral ideas, which need to be intimated by the wealth of imagery in a successful work of art because they *outrun* or can never be fully captured by ordinary experience but not because they in any way *precede* or *underlie* ordinary experience."" (154-55)</p>
<p>7. So in the end he says Kant's theory is very different. And specifically Cohen ""cannot appeal to Kant for his theory of aeshthetic *contents*."" (155) Guyer thinks that Cohen has invented this on his own and it reflects ideas about aesthetics more typical of his (and our?) time: namely, the tendnecy to place an empahsis on ""feelings or the subjective dimensions of experience in general as the special subject of art taht we find in such representative writers of the next half-century as bullough and Collingwood."" (155)</p>
<p>8. From 155-159, Guyer tries to show how Cohen's different appraoch to aesthetics produces different results. The fact that Cohen uses an analytical approach -- starting from the ""fact"" that art and artistic genius exists as a basis for belieivng that art expresses a lawfulness of aeshtetic consciousness and that judgements of taste have a universal basic -- whereas Kant ""Kant intoruces his conception of genius as an ability to create universally accesible works o fart only after he has, at least to his own satisfaction, deduced th epossiblityof universally valid judgemnts of taste from the commonality of huma cognitive powers... "" (156)&nbsp; -- This difference plays a key role in Guyer's spinning out of what i unique in Cohen's approach. The eeffect seems to be that Cohen is drawing heavily on a particular experience of art -- one that is perhaps peculiar to his own life and times -- and not to Kant's. In th eprocess of doing this, Cohen sets art a ""higher task"" of bing a vehicle for the idealization of nature in an image of morality. (156) It's job then is to depict a ""ntural object as an object of morailty"" and in so doing tranform ""natural and morality into art-feeling."" (157) This could be said to be inspired by Kan'ts idea that ""we have an intellectual interest in the beauty of nature insofar as it gives us a hint that our moral purposes can be realized in nature."" (157) But Cohen says that Cohen's claim goes much much further because it does not mererely posit a parallel between natural beauty and moral success or Kant's idea that&nbsp; all art ""must ultiamtely concern ideas of reason"" -- it suggest further that ""all art ultiamtely *directly* concerns the realiation of morality in&nbsp; anture or the possiblity of a higher degree of that realization taht we ordinarily experience."" (157) Kant did not advocate such a strong and direct position. And Guyer thinks that in getting here Cohen had drawn on ""a supposed fact about the arts rather than any *a priori* arguemnt..."" (157) Guyer thinks that Cohen may owe an ""explanation"" of this ideal function of art and ""its function of expressing our priimordial feelings underlying our representations of both nature and morality..."" (157) He guess that it may be that Cohen thinks that ""among our primordial feelings is a never-fully expressed yearning that nature and morality full coincide, and that we expressing thsi feeling through art."" (157)</p>
<p>This is consistent with this reinterpration of Kant's idea about ""supersensible substrarum"" of both humanity and nature -- the thing-in-itself. This is complex: Kant only problematically deals with the ""antimony of taste"" -- that on the one hand judgements of taste are not rule governed, and yet they have a claim to universal validity. He seems to resolve it by saying that these response are based on free play, but then it's not clear why he ""should suddenly resort to the metaphysical conception of a supersensible substrarum or common noumenal characer of all manking to explain the possiblity of agreement in taste or to a common supersensibl substartum of both mankingd and nature to explain the natural existence of things we find beautiful."" (157-8) Cohen gets aroudn this by denying the metaphysical gesture. Instead he tsays that Kant's idea here was not metaphysical but ""more like a practical conception of an infinitte task the realization of which we cna approach only asymptotically..."" (158) Ie we never fully gain knowledge of nature or of morality. VV asethetics this may be, Guyer thinks, the idea of a ""realization of our primoredial desire for a unification of the naturl and the moral that can never be fully realized in reality nor full expressed in art."" (158) He quotes Cohen on 158. In part <br />Cohen writes: ""Aesthetic purposiveness also presents such a task as the aesthetic idea, as a 'supersensible ground,' as a thing in itself of consciousnes."" (158)&nbsp; This idea that art is the ""thing in itself of consciouenss"" is far far far afield from Kant Guyer says. Such an idea would have been self-contraditroy for Kant. He notes that Cohen is clearly using Kant's term for very different purposes. And in the best part here, he specifies what he thinsk this might be: namely a different expereince of art, where art is directed more exclusively to the arousal of emotions, and he quotes Cohen on 158-9, in a very striking quote.</p>
<p>NOTE: What Guyer is talkiung about here it seems to me, although nto really wanting to say it, is the turn in aesthetics away from that Greek ideal, where beauty is about harmony and precision in represneation, to one where it is more about emotional enthusiasm. The same shift that Mosse perhaps identifies in the rise of German ethnonationalism, a desire to feel emotion as a way of idenitfying with a certain experience of German cultivation. It's significant here that Guyer also cirticizes Cohen at several points for being a Geramn nationalist....</p>
<p>* In the section on Cohn and then on Dilthey, Guyer shows how they trace a similar line grounding their aesthetics more on what Dilthey ultimately calls ""lived experience"" while also placing more emphasis on heightened emotions. Both Cohn and Dilthey, however, go much further than did Cohen when specifying how their aesthetics is grounded in the ""fact"" of aesthetic experience.</p>
<p>* Cohn grounds aesthetic experience in an ability to access and sympathize with the inner life of others and this, in turn, allows people to escape the narrowness of their own experience. Cohn writes: ""For us human beings the inner life of anothers is in general accessible only insofar as we grasp intuited movements or other sensibly perceivable processes as experssion and with their assistance sympathetically experience [miterleben] what is expressed. The only possiblity for us to esacpe the narrowness of our own individualiity, or expanidng our personality beyond its limits, lies in this sympathetic life [Mitleben.]"" (quoted on 162) So Cohn replaces Kan'ts free play of faculties definition of aesthetic expereince with ""our apprecation of the epxression of the inner life of other livign beings"".</p>
<p>* Guyer notes that this suggetss a ""very different relation between the aesthetic and the moral"" than Kant's as well: ""For Kant as we have seen, the experience of th beautiful and the sublime may *prepare* us for morality in certain ways, the beautiful may be a *symbol* of the morally good, and we m ay taken an 'empirical interest' in the fact that our pleasure in beautiful objects is shared, that is, take an additional enjoyment from the fact thtat we enjoyt he same things as others, but for Kant all of these are *consequences* of our basic enjoyment of the beautiful becasue of the free play of our cognitive powers that it stimulates, whereas for Cohn our essentially moral desire to empathize with others is the *basis* for our apprecaition of the beautiful, and aour enjoyment of occasion for successful communcation of feelings with or at least from others is constitutive of the pleasure of the beautiful."" (163) In grounding aesthetic experience in his own experience of art of his time, Cohn does not want to collapse the moral into the aesthetic. He identifies what is unique about the aesthetic by arguign that we expeirence theinner life of others in a ""determinate form [*Gestaltung*]"" and unliked Kant-- who linked dealt with form and content differently , see 163 -- but he defines it as that thing that llows what is ""essential ni the epxression"" of others to come forth as being central to this definite form. (163) Much of his work is focused then on ""description of the ways in which the different media of the arts allow the epxression of th einner life to become clear..."" (163) The value of aesthetics for Cohen (moral value) has to do&nbsp; with thefact that he sees the need to express oursevles to others as a key human need. Aesthetic expereince is important becuase it ""allows us to transcend the boudnaries of our individuality and to communicate with others..."" (164) And unlilke Cohen, eh thinks that unlike in sciene and ethics, ""in aesthetic experience we can and do attain the completion that we long for elsewhere."" Cohn: ""The aesthetic is completed in present intutiion [als Anschauung vorhanden[, it attains fulfillment, it is not longing but posession. Thereby it elevates the human being above the narrowness of his own life."" (164)&nbsp; KEY THOUGH is that although Cohn argues this he maintains the Kantian (and neo-Kantian) insistence tht ""the asethetic gives us actual knowledge of the idea or a genuine guarantee of the possiblity of the complete realization of the dmands and&nbsp; goals of morality."" (164)<strong> In grounding aesthetic experience in actual human experience and in the value of transcending the narrowness of one's own exitence by coming to know theinner life of others, however, Cohn more closely links aesthetics and morality than did Kant. That is because, by defining aesthetics as essentially a ""medium for insight not into the external world in general but into the feelings of others...the value of the aesthetic is ultimately founded in the importance of such cognition of the inner life of others for the achievment of a cultural community, thus for the achievment&nbsp; of the essential goal of morality."" (164-5)</strong></p>
<p>* So Guyer says that both Cohen and Cohn as proponents of a neo-Kantian aesthetics have, by rejecting Kant's notion of free-play as the bsais of aesthetics and in their emphasis on the human feelings, heightened the specific ""cognitive and moral significance of the asethetic"" in a way that Kant did not consider. (165) Guyer notes that this can be considered their contribution to aesthetics. But he also thinks that Kant's more modest claims may sometimes be ""salubrious, a strong cup of coffeee that needs to be drunk after induglling in some of the more intoxicating claims"" both of absolute idealists, and in Guyer's interpreation, the ""neo-Kantians...""

(259)</p>
<p>Toews breaks down the quesitons addressed in the volume into three parts which he lays out on 259-260:</p>
<p>1) Are the theoretical and discplinary conflicts of the last 1/4 of the 20th century simply typical of the ""continual process of reviisson that sustains the very idea of historical consicosness"" or was there an ""epochal shift""?  If there was an end to the ""experiment of modernity""--which the authors take as axiomatic he points out--then does this mean we have aslo reached the ""end"" of history?  What defines the current activity of historical consciousness?  Is it limited to professional historians?</p>
<p>2) Related to #1, but more ""specific"": The past is understood by the editors as ""an aggregate of representations, interpretations, or constructions."" The past is always ""absent"" then ""not just in the epistemological sense that we can only know it as a stissue of representations and not as  objective, empirically verifiable reality, but also in the ontological sense that the being of the past is unavailable to us.  However much we may desire to touch, feel, smell, hear, that is 'experience' the past, such encounters will always remain beyond our reach.  The past has no agency, no independent voice in our actions and conversations"" (259) That claim he links to a belief that the ""linguistic turn"" in historiography and historical theory is ""irreversable."" (259, bottom).  But that idea has bene udner attack he says for a long time, and not ""just from 'conservative' believers in the autonomous, centered subject of modernity and its ability to tell the truth about the past or judge the events of the past on the basis of universalizable, ethical codes obligating all autonomous subjects."" (260)  It has been attacked in relation to the idea that the linguistic turn in its reductive and totlaizing forms, esp as represnted by an old guard, must be broken.  So: ""has the focus on linguistic representation and textualized constrution of meaning unduly restrited the scope and diversity of debates concernting the contemporary crisis in historical conscoiusness?  Should the 'linguistic turn' give way to a more complex view of the post modern condition, <strong>perhaps one that recognizes the continuing, tangible presence in the present of the ruins or fragements of the past life that persistently make their own demands to be heard as we construct our representations, and that recognizes more obviously the role of mateiral practice in the construction of historical experience?</strong>"" (260) Toews also notes that in the volume the index contains no links to Walter Benjamin, but does reference W.G. Sebald as a ""somewhat ghostly presence witnessing to the complex contradictions, ambiguities, and hybridities, to the entanglement of textual construction and material presence, in current debates about the production of historical consciousness 'after' the linguistic turn.""

Beyond Separate Spheres: Intellectual Roots of Modern Feminism,"p.050 Sexual segregation fueled by fear of socialism in Harper

Rosenberg argues that Harper's desire to demonstrat ethe utility of science to businessmen and to avoid identification of sociology with socialism drove sexual segregation (50) -- which isolated reform as in creation of a school of social work.  

Harper's concern came after Pullman STrike in 1894 when economist Edward Bemis, who advocated socializaiton of municipal services, defnded the railroad's case against the strikers (50)  Harper chasties Bemis and Bemis was soon dismissed from the University.  (50)  Albion Small did not defend Bemis much, writing him that ""I do not say tha tyour conclusions are wrong, but in theese days a manis not considered scientific, who claims to speak on more than one small corner of a subject."" (Samll quoted on 50).  Now Rosenberg writes; ""Because many women, both inside and outside the university, tended to be more outspoken on political issues than eihte rSmall or Harper though proper, prompting the identification of socialism not just with sociologists but with feminist sociologists in particulra, sexual segregation seemed all the more crucial to those who would protect the university's reputation as abastion of authority and respectability.""

Beyond Separate Spheres: Intellectual Roots of Modern Feminism,"p.040-41 W.I. Thomas's diss develops theory of female uniqueness 

Using Geddes (who work addressed Weismann's) Thomas established a notion of difference of females  and males at the cellular level.  (40) At cellular level, maleness an expending of energy; femaleness a conserving of energy.   He combined Ward's gynecocentric thoery and Geddes' theory of sexual metabolism.  He linked female ""anabolism"" (versus kataboolism, to woman's reproductive system.  and used it to explain her ""superior psychological irritability...""  (41)    but although he saw man as more advanced, he also argued that ""evolutionary development had achieved such complexity that man's katabolic destructiveness, militarism, and competetiveness were posing a serious social danger."" (41, Rosenberg's words)  And Thomas thought (his words) that ""It is now beginning to be true that the energies of women may find expression in forms of activity appropriate to their nature...and this will doubtless, in thelong run, favor construtive, as over against destructive, modes of social interaction.""

The Radicalism of the American Revolution,"<p>D Part III -- Democracy</p>
<p>15. The Assault on Aristocracy</p>
<p>* By the end of the 18th century, W says, the Federalist leaders ""relatively speaking, had already lost most of the substantial economic and social pwoer that had made aristocracies traditionally viable."" (271)</p>
<p>* Wood explains in detail the arguments of Abraham Bishop of Connecticut who had been college educated at Yale in 1778, but became an ardent opponent of the Constitution and of the Federalists.  His critique was typical of the rhetoric of the Republican party in that he attacked the Federalists as corrupt leaders who were in the process of setting up a financial structure that was ""a British funding system, Americanized."" (272)   But what was unique is that he possessed an ""acutely modern understanding of culture.""  (272)  He realized that American's ideas were often in a ""state of most absolute subordination to mere human invention.""  (272)  He wanted Americans to deconstruct their artificial belief that certain men were better able to lead.  He wanted to convince people that their sense of inferority to a gentry elite was based on delusion.  But in saying this, he admitted that these elite were superior in education and manner, but these qualities made them less able to lead, not more.  He questioned the assumption that such ""great men"" were better leaders.  He noted that these men were different so that their claim to represent the common people was wrong.  (271-274). Bishops' not the only attack on aristocracy, but the most oustlandish.</p>
<p>*  Everywhere Wood says aristocrats were ""besieged"" relentleslly by common people who had never gone to college.  These men were sick, Wood says, of being depicted as ""factious, narrow, parochial, and illiberal and were unwilling to defer any longer.."" (276)</p>
<p>* Wood thinks this was the central transformation of the Revolutinon.  All these attacks by ordinary men on aristocrats weakened the northern gentry, underminging their ability to rule, even Wood says, Jefferson's ""natural aristocracy.""  <strong>""Here in this destruction of aristocracy...was the real American Revolution--a radical alteration in the nature of American society whose effects are still being felt today."" (276)</strong></p>
<p>* Most critics of the gentry did not, as Bishop, emphasize differences between commoners and gentry, but rather emphasizeed their similarity so as to undermine their claims to distinctiveness and privilege. (276)</p>
<p>* The meaning of work/lesiure shifted.  Whereas aristocrats tried to show how little they worked, that was not any longer something people did.  There was a new emphasis on the importance and dignity of work. (277)  This porduced new attacks on aristocratic idleness, affecting in particular southern society where the aristocracy existed in a life of leisrue based on the work of salves.  (277-278).</p>

The Origins of American Social Science,"[54-] [DR on Intellectual Authority ]
In Gilded Age: 
Dorothy tells the story of the rise of the professions in relation to a problem of intellectual authority.  It is a problem of maintaining the nationalist exceptionalist ideology in the face of the growing power of science and the discrediting of religious providential determinants of America's special course:
""The problem of intellectual authority developed during the 1860s and 1870s, as the harmony between science and religion declared by virtually all segments of Protestant Christianity proved incresaingly difficult to maintain.""  (54)  
Not going into this right now, but need to re-read these pages in terms of this problem...for she tells the story through it.   The attempt to found sciences is part of an attempt reassert intellectual authority and maintain this nationalist ideology.

Questions Concerning Certain Faculties Claimed For Man,"<p>General Notes for Class</p>
<p>(not teaching so light notes)</p>
<p>Q1 :</p>
<p>* Def'n inutition: ""inutition will be taken as signifying a cognition not determined by a previous cognition of the same object, and therefore so determined by something out of the consciousness."" (18) He also said it&nbsp; can be thought of as a ""premiss not itself a conclusion"" (18)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* He says right off the bat: ""There is no evidence that we have this faculty, except that we seem to <em>feel</em> that we have it."" (19)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* He sees a similarity in our acceptance of the existence of intutition with the Medieval acceptance of the idea of ""external authority"". (19)&nbsp; ""...the credibility of authority was regarded by men of that time siply as an ultimate premiss, as a cognition not determined by a previous cognition of the same object, or in our terms, as an intuition."" (19)&nbsp; But those claims of authority were called into doubt becasue there were disagreements about what authority meant; so too can intuition be called into doubt.&nbsp; (19-20)</p>
<p>* He shows how the intuitive faculty of having knowledge can be complicated in any number of examples 19-25.&nbsp; He's showing often that intuited knowledge is not always purely intuited, or it is hard for us to know what is simply known and what is perceived, or what is misperceived in fact.&nbsp; Take his example on 22-24 about how we perceive space: is this a form of intuited ""immediate knowledge.""&nbsp; He suggests not because, drawing on pscyhological/neurological ideas, we can explain it in other ways., which he does on 23.&nbsp; Point is that there's a perception of ""phenomena of extreme complexity"" and he says it is well-known in this case that when that is the case and when those phebnomena can be ""reduced to <em>order</em> or mediate simplicity by the application of a certain conception, that conception sooner or later arises in application to those phenomena.""&nbsp; (24)&nbsp; In this case, that concept is the concept of ""extension"" (of space).&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Having given these examples, he points out that since we can explain these facts without recourse to an intuitive faculty, then ""there are ...very strong reasons for disbelieving the existience of thsi facutly."" (25)&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>IN the next series of questions, he will show why we should doubt the existence of this intuitive facutly</strong>:</p>
<p>Q2: Do we have an intuitive self-consciousness?</p>
<p>* Self-consciousness is not the same as consciousness, from the internal sense, or from ""pure apperception."" (26)&nbsp; All cognition he says is ""a consciousness of the object as represented"" (26)&nbsp; Self-consciousness refers to a ""knowledge of ourselves."" (26)&nbsp; Pure apperception is ""the self-assertion of THE <em>ego</em>; the self-consciousness here meant is the recognition of my <em>private</em> self."" (26)&nbsp; But hoow then do we have this self-consiousness?</p>
<p>* It is not obvious taht we have an intutitive faculty (Q1) because we can't distinguish an intuitive power of understanding from a cognitive one as he showed vv spatial perception.&nbsp; (26) So can we do the same with self-consciousess, explain it in other ways than intuition?</p>
<p>* He takes as his case in point children.&nbsp; They have no self-consciousness or an imperfect one.&nbsp; But they have powers of cognition.&nbsp; Their body is very imporrtant, it is the center of the world, and ""Only what it touches has any actual and present feeling; only what it faces has any actual color; only what is on its tongue has any actual taste."" (27)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Going further in this explanation of child's development he argues that as the child learns he begins to undertand language, and the link between souds and actions or facts.&nbsp; And Peirce thins that ti is is a""about this time"" that the cihld ""beings to find that what these people about him say is the very best evidence of fact.&nbsp; So much, so that testimony is even a stronger mark of fact than <em>the facts themselves</em>, or rather than what we must now be thought of as the <em>appearances</em> themselves."" (28)&nbsp; <strong>So what people say -- or testimony -- becomes important, more important than the facts.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>* But then the child is told the stove is hot, but he think not, and then he touches it and it is, and then he discovers ignorance and error.&nbsp; Here Peirce thinks that self-consciousness begins.&nbsp; Indeed he says: ""Ignorance and error are all that distinguish our private selves fromt he absolute <em>ego </em>of pure apperception."" (29)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Here then is an explanation of self-consciousness not stemming from intutition.&nbsp; So then he says at the end that the only ""argument worth noticing for the exstience of an intuitive self-consciousness is this: We are more certain of our own exitence than of any other fact; a premiss can not determine a conclusion to be more certain than it is itself; hence, our own existence cannot have been inferred from any other fact."" (29)&nbsp; The first part of this argument--that we are so certain of our own existence--is ok, but the second logical arugment is false he says.&nbsp; Because in fact ""A conclusion cannot be more certain than that some one of the facts which support it is true, but it may easily be more certain than any one of those facts.""&nbsp; He gives an example of witnesses of events who testify.&nbsp; Believing them depends on the fact that they are to be believed.&nbsp; But he says ""the fact testified to is made more certain than that any one of those men is generally to be believed.""&nbsp; (30)&nbsp; Applying this to the idea of self-consciousness, he says that ""to the developed mind of man, his own existence is supported by <em>every other fact</em>, and is, therefore, incomparably more certain than any one of these facts.&nbsp; But it cannot be said to be more certain than that there is another fact, since there is no doubt perceptible in either case."" (30)&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>[ This part seems key!!&nbsp; Our self-consciousness as he explains in disproving the intuitive notion is grounded in testimony, that causes us to become aware at some point of our own ignorance and error.&nbsp; That testimony is also of a socail nature--it happens in groups.&nbsp; Groups of witnesses make claims about the world of facts that become more important than the facts themselves.&nbsp; Then also as eh reasons at the end while disproving the logical argument for intuitive self-consciousness, these testimonies become truer, more certain, than the credibility/accuracy of those making them; ie there can always be a different set of testimonies.&nbsp; He's using a kind of pragmatic logic perhaps--pragmatic because it's based on an awareness of the effect of belief--to undo certainty about intuitive self-consciousenss....we rely on testimony and its effect for our self-consciousenss, and our reliance on testimony also means we can't logically justify a necessary belief in an intuitive self-consciousnes...]</em></p>
<p>Q3: Can we distinguish intuitively between the subjective and objective elements of a cognition?</p>
<p>* What's a cognition? It's ""something represented, or that of which we are conscious, and some action or passion of the self whereby it becomes represented."" (30) The cognition has a subjective and objective element: the subjective element is I think the ""action or passion"" that causes the objectve to re represneted; the objective is the representation?? His langauge is very unclear here.&nbsp; But the subjective element is ""not necessarily immediately known"" awhereas the ""cognition itself is an intutition of its objective element..."" (30)</p>
<p>* The question is whether there is also an inutition of the subjective element that comes along with each cognition?</p>
<p>* At first, eh says the asnwers seems to be yes, simply because we seem to be able to distinguish dreams from reality, or we know the difference ""between seein a color and imagining it..."" (30)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* But since we ""cannot intutiively know that a cognition is intuitive"" (Q1 and Q2) (31)&nbsp; we cannot know that we have this faculty intuitively.&nbsp;</p>
<p>* So is it ""necessary"" to imagine that we have this ability to distinguish subjective and objective elements of cognition?&nbsp; The evidence of knowing the difference between dreams and reality is not convincing, because what is at issue is not whether we are aware of different situations in what ""is present to th emind"" but whether we can know of diffeerent ""modes of consciousness"" ""indepdently of any such distinctions in the immediate <em>objects </em>of consciousness."" (31)&nbsp; And in this case of dreams, the difference is created by the different in the immediate objects of consciousness... (31)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Another distinction: belief versus conception.&nbsp; We know the difference.&nbsp; But is this due to some intuitive sense?&nbsp; He says we distinguish the two by ""a peculiar feeling of conviction"" that accompanies belief.&nbsp; Then he says we see belief as ""that judgement which is accompanied by this feeilng, or as that judgement from which a man will act.""&nbsp; (31)&nbsp; The former can be called sensational judgement and the latter active.&nbsp; But returning to the point he made above.&nbsp; The difference is again here not based on intutiion.&nbsp; In the case of sensational judgement, the capacity is only to feel the sensations of the judgement, not intution.&nbsp; In the case of active judgement, again it's not intutiton, but rather the understanding of its existence is ""discovered by the observation of external facts and by inference from the sensation of conviction which usually accompanies it."" (32)&nbsp; IE initution is not needed!!</p>
<p><strong>Q4: Wehther we know the world introspectively or ""whether our whole knowledge of he internal wordl is dervied from the observation of external facts""&nbsp; </strong>(32)</p>
<p>* He's not trying to say the external world is real, only that ""there is a certain set of facts which are ordinarily regarded as external, while others are regarded as internal."" (32)&nbsp; IE He's not neccessarily legitimizing metaphysical dualism as true.&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Introspecition means ""a direct perception of the internal world, but not necessarily a perception of it as internal."" (32)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* He says that perception has an ""internal element"" in one sense.&nbsp; Ie that ""every sensation is partly determined by internal conditon.""&nbsp; He gives the exampel of ""redness.""&nbsp; As a sensation, redness is somehow sensed in the way it is ""owing to the constitution of the mind"" and in that sense it is ""something internal.""&nbsp; But it arises only as a ""predicate of something external."" (32)&nbsp; This&nbsp; isn't tryue for all sesnations, such as emotions ""which appear to arise in the first place,&nbsp; not as predciates at all."" (32)&nbsp; So then given the existence of emotins maybe some ""knowledge of the mind may be obtained, which is not inferred from any character of outward things."" (32)</p>
<p>* But because we have no way to distinguish different subjective modes of consciousness (Q3), we cannot know intuitively or self-evidently that we possess this capacity.&nbsp; (32-33)</p>
<p>* Then he attacks the idea that he just presented that emotions arise without any predicate.&nbsp; He says that although they have no ""determinate and constant character in its object,"" the emotion is still ""some relative character in the outward thing which makes him angry..."" (33)&nbsp; <strong>The difference between emotion and an ""objective intellectual judgement"" he says is that the latter is ""relative to human nature or to mind in general"" whereas the latter is relative to the ""particular circumstances and disposition of a particular man at a particular time."" (33)&nbsp; And this he says is true also for moral judgement and for beauty!!! <em>""Good and bad are feeling which first arise as predicates, and therefore are either predicates of the not-I, or are determined by previous cognitions (there being no intuitive power of distinguishing subjective elements of consciousness.)""</em> (33)&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>* This means then that we may not really be dealing with anything that is purely introspective even with emotions, morality, and beauty.&nbsp; This is surely a jab at Kant.&nbsp; (33)</p>
<p>* Then he asks, do we need to think this introspective power exists for the saking of ""willing"".&nbsp; And he rejects this saying that the capcaity for volition is just ""the power of concentrating the attention, of abstractign."" (33) And this power can be ""inferred"" from the existence of abstract objects, just as the power of seeing can be inferred from the existence of colored things. (33)</p>

Professions and Patriarchy,"<p>Chapter 2</p>
<p>This chapter is particualrly useful and I might want to return to it occasionally for its survey of the literature on professions.</p>
<p>She starts out with a look and the analysis of Professions and Power.  Johnson (1972) reocneptualized the profession as not an ""occupation per se but a mode of controlling an occupation"" and this has become the ""new ortodoxy in the sociology of profssions."" (40)</p>
<p>There has been a ""conceptual revolution in the sociology of professions from the dominance of the 'trait' and 'fucntionliast' paradigms through to the jostling for position between neo-Weberian and neo-Marxist paradigms..."" Cropmpton 1990 analyzes this.  Parsons 1954 article was the fucntionlaist paradigm.  It ""empahised the distinctiveness of modern professions, lcoating their development with the rationalising tendencies of the wider society."" (40)</p>
<p>""'Trait' approaches attempted to identify precisely what constitued this distinctiveness, looking for essential attributes or traits (cf Greenwood 1957)."" (40)</p>
<p>She also notes Wilenskiy's 1964 article that discussed the ""process"" whereby an occupation turned itself into a profession.  She says this was less ""static."" (40)</p>
<p>She says that these approaches ""fondered on the sheer diversity of elements tha various authors identiifed as providing the ssence of profession..."" (40)</p>
<p>Johnson's critique entered at this point and the ""kernel"" of the critique was in Johnson's words:</p>
<p>""Not only do 'trait' approaches tend to incoroporate the professionals' own definitions of themselves in seemingly neutral categories, but the categories tend to be derived from the analysis of a very few professional bodies and included features of professional organisation nd practice which found full epxression on in Anglo-American culture at a particular time in the historical development of the professions."" (quoted on 41)</p>
<p>Johnsons' critique has persisted in a neo-Weberian perspective on preofessionalisation.  Neo-Weberian conepts hav been deployed to support this idea of the profession as ameans of control over an occupation.  She cites Freidson 1970a and 1970b and Parkin 1979 and Parry and Parry 1976.  All have defined ""professionalisation as a strategy of social closure and a means of collective social mobility..."" (42)</p>

They describe three processes: entextualizaiton, detextualization, and retextualization.

The first is like Boas teaching Hunt how to write certain words and critiquing his texts; the second is the erasure of that process, the detextualization of the process of production of the text, and retexutalization is when the finsihed text enters into a new textual context of professsoinal anthropology.

So herein the authors have already critiqued Boas's erasure of the process of production of the text."
"The First Boasian: Alfred Kroeber and Franz Boas, 1896-1905","p.522  Kroeber Diss: reject search for origins

Kroeber's dissertation Jacknis describes as an ""important contribution to the developing Boasian critique of cultural evolution."" (522)  He cites a further 1922 article by himself ""The Artist Himself..."" in The Early Years of Native American History..., 134-161.  As well as a piece by Thoresent ""Art, Evolution, and History: A CAse Study of Paradigm Change in Anthropology"" Journal of hIsotry of Behavioral Sciences 13: 107-125.  The subject was whether ""Arapaho specimens could shed light on the origins of decorative designs in realistic or geometric impulses, as well as th erleation between form and meaning, an important concern of 19th-century evolutionists, which was then under review by Boas.  Finding both tendencies to be present and equally developed in Arapaho art, Kroeber conlcuded that the evolutionists' search for origins was futile."" (523).

so he Kroeber wrote: ""The fundamental error of the common anthropological [comparative] method is that it isolates phenomena and seeks isolated causes fo rthem.  IN reality, ethnic phenomena doo not exist separately: they have their being only in culture."" (quoted on 523, see diss, 1901, p. 335)."
Liberalism Repatriated: Prospects of an Anthropology of Antiracism,"p.333-4 The Problem 1st via the French Example

Tejani describes the French law banning the hijab this way: the decision to ban it was a rational/practical decision based on the concerns of teachers that hijab suggested a student had been coerced, and yet that decision was influenced by the underlying moral sensibility which saw the hijab as a religious sign which indicated religious coercion, i.e. the basic underlying French moral sensibility that ""a cultural symbol with any religious connotation to be a sign of religious passion and thus offensive to ppers..."" (333).

The moral sensibility which cannot reflect on itself, that sees itself as universal, thus supports the rational decision to ban the hijab.  

The relationship between moral sensibility and critical rational knowledge in relation to differences between humans he roots in the civilization v. kultur difference, a tradition which he presnets as being a protean form of racial thought which developed into racial thought, and then more explicitly racial-biological notions of colonialism.  

But given these differences, as what he calls the ""diaspora of liberalism"" -- i.e. its spread to the rest of the world -- raised teh question of how these peoples, whose values were so different, could be assimilated.  

This ultimately creates what he calls an ""assimilationsist liberalism"" -- which he refers to noting Povinelli again, only occured once the colonial populations had been essentially destroyed."
Classical Social Theory and the Origins of Modern Sociology,"<p>General Notes</p>
<p><br />Giddens executes a critique of the standard history of sociology in this article, attempting to dispel a set of ""myths"" (laid out in works by Parsons, Nisbet, and Dahrendorf) about the discipline's development: namely, the myth that ""order"" is the central concern of sociology, the myth that the classical sociologists, Durkheim and Weber, were motivated by a conservative reactino against revolution, and finally the myth of schism--that the only two solution to the problem of order are that of Parsons', i.e. consensus, or that most clearly expressed in Marx, ie emphasis on conflict.  The overall effect Giddens seems to be aiming to achieve is to debunk a set of quasi-historical interpretations of the hsitory of sociological theory that serve to limit sociology's ability to develop in the new directinos that Giddens thinks are necessary to grapple with the problems of the future (that is, the context for the article is, as stated on 715-716 that sociology is at a ""crossroads"" having, I think&lt; to do with the critique of structural-functioanlism)</p>
<p>After dispelliing a series of myths about sociology's epistemological development, contained in the ""myths"" just listed, Giddens then seeks to blow up the ""substantive correlate"" (718) of structural-functionalism: the ""theory of industrial society,"" which Giddens thinks is an inadequate focal point of this tradition of sociology, belonging in fact to that generation of writers from 1890-1920 for whom the main tension was in fact the tension between traditional agrarian  society and the new urban industrialized society.  This is no longer a useful theory in the 20th century when ""the main 'internal' divisions and strains in the advacned societies are no longer, as in the 19th and early 20th centuries, based upon the tensions between urban-industrial centers and the centrifugal pull of the rural hinterland.  He also argues that the theory of industrial society has a similarly ""time-bound"" ""antipolitical bias,"" a product of the fact that in the 19th century there existed a ""covert assumption"" that ""the State is subordinate to society, and that consequently politics can be explained, or, more accurately, explained away, by reference ot more deply layered social phenomena."" (719) He explains other related assumptions on 720.  And then describes the possibilites of a sociology that has borken free of the industrial theory of society on 721-722.</p>
<p>The most relevant argument in this article for my purposes re the understanding of the history of sociology is a product of his dispelling all of these other myths.  Parsons method (or reason) for destructing these myths is a desire to weaken the largest narrative idea of a ""great divide"" between what he calls the ""prehistory of social theory, when it had not yet been disentangled from speculative philosophy or the philosophy of history"" and the thinkers of the period from 1890 to 1920--Durkheim, Weber as well as Pareto, Michels, Simmel... (703-704).  This narrative of the ""great dividde"" was most powerfully established as orthodoxy by Parsons' <em>The Structure of Social Action</em>.  By attacking they myths described above Giddens is essentially weakening arguments about the distinctiveness of this generation.  The reason for this critique becomes clear in a last section in which he brushes aside claims that in this generation socials cience was cfinally becomign ""scientific"" as well as the claim that their writings were a ""conservative"" defense of bourgeois society.  He points out that each writer wrote in a different socio-political context--his explanation is good on 724-725--and that ultimately ""[b]oth conservatism and socialism thus figure in the political backgrounds of both Kurkheim and Weber.""  The work of each, Giddens finally argues, is ""an attem[pt to <em>rethink the foundation of liberalism in conditions in which liberal individualism and its base in social theory, namely, utilitarian philosophy, developed in the British situation, were manifestly inappropriate.</em>"" (725-726).  The different situations against which Durkheim and Weber wrote altered their projects: ""Weber worked against the backdrop not of  asuccessful revolution (1789) but of a failed one (1848) and in the shadow of Bismarck's unification of the German state through military triumph...Durkheim's <em>Division of Labor</em> and the theory of the state which he later elaborated were directed twoard resolving the 'legacy of the Revolution' as he saw it: the distance between the ideals of freedom and equality heralded in 1789, and the reality of social stagnation and resistance to cahnge which he thought were epitomized by the disasters of the war of 1870--the very war which sealed German unity--and by the repression of the Commune."" (726)</p>
<p>Ultimately, Giddens isn't saying that the 1890-1920 generation was not distinct, but not in the way that Parsons, Nisbet, and Dahrendorf have described.  Here's what he thinks made them unique: ""First, as I've already tried to show, an attempt to rethinking the foundations of liberalism in the face of the twin challenge of revolutionary socialism and conservatism.  Second, the successful beginning of sociology as an accepted subject in the university curriculum....Third, a greatly heightened sensitivity to the study of other cultures and a breaking away from European ethnocentrism.  Foruth, and not unconnected with the third point, a general resurgence of concern with the soruces of unreason in human social existence (see Hughes 1958).""  (726)  NOTE: He's citing Huges' <em>Consciousness and Society</em>.</p>"

"Verging on Etra-Vagance: Anthropology, Hisotry, Religion, Literature, Arts...Showbiz","(2) p.23-24  Ultra-Objectivity

Concept for Boon, gegen the dichotomy between objectivity and subjectivity (i.e. the critique of early Anth as not objective by people who proposed to be doing objective work).  

Ultraobjectivity is a concept he tries to define via Webster's as something that ""is 'intersubjectively observable' in the 'extreme ....beyond what is ordinary, proper.'"" (23)   He also calls it , via W. James, ""radical empiricism.""  {that relation would need at least to be epxlained a bit] 

My impression is that it is something like a kind of objectivity gained by being honest about not knowing for sure what something is....  I also got this sense from earlier quote: ""I side with interpretive skepticism regarding objectivity in cultural matters.  However, far from simply disavowing 'objectivity,'  I object to narrow positivism in hopes of a fuller objectivity..."" (23)

Methodologically this has a lot do with open reading.  Because what he calls ""Salutary doubt,"" he says, ""springs from empircial and textual details of intricate social , political, and linguistic configurations. "" (24) As well as he suggests in ""circumstances of conflictual <i>translation</i>--the very circumstances where anthropology transpires."" (i..e the ""field"").  (24) 

This then leads to Benedict since he things that approached ""rituals as 'readings'"" and he will perform the ritual of re-reading her text. (24)"
The Making of a Feminine Professional Identity: Social Workers in the 1920s,"p. 1051 - 1052 Basic Question: Is Social Work a Profession?

This question asked in 1930 essay in Survey, a journal of social service reform.  Here Miss Case-Worker"" named Jane is set against Lady Bountiful, the old-fashioned, voluntary social worker. 

 The answer given is yes she is.   But Walkowiz points out that the answer was no so easy, in particular ""objectivity and raitonality were conventionally associated with male professional culture ...[so] the scientific model created its own tensions for female social workers."" (1051)

Hi spoint is that they were struggling to construct a ""work identity"" as part of a ""transformed white-collar work force.  

See also his f.n. #4, with many citations of work on professions dominated by women.  Melosh in particular concludes in Physician's hand as quotedin f.n.: ""...in broader cultural terms, nursing by definition cannot be a profession because most nurses are women."" (f.n. #4 1052)  After giving the citations Walkowitz writes: ""These studies all identify the problem of understanding women in these profession as a conflict between professionalization and femininity or between professionalization and proletarinization, implicitly assuming these dyads were mutually exclusive or antagonistic categories. "" (f.n. #4 1052)

Ultimately, Walkowitz sets out the idea that the search for this new work identity failed: ""...this post-war, post-suffrage generation sought both a career and family, albeit not necessarily at the same time.  The burgeoning consumer family economy in the 1920s further complicated women's work expectations.  A professional standard of living dictated new levels of material acquisition supposedly appropriate to a white-collar middle-class occupations stratum.  This consumer culture and ambiguities about respectable women's public roles compelled women to seek a new work identity.  But none of the available ideologies and representations produced by mass media or by union an dprofessional associations could serve to orient female social workers in a world of work shaped by the contradictory imperatives of domesticity, career, and consumption. "" (1052)  

What emerged he argues were two categories, that didn't come into explicit use until the 60s: the Professional Woman ""a female social worker who accepted the 'male' ideology"" (1052) and the Professional Worker, ""a 'neutered' white-collar proletarian"" (1052).  W thinks that neither ""adequately expressed the gendered character of social work."" (1052)"
Transnational History in Historical Perspective: Bastian's Museum Project,"<p>Notes 9/2013:</p>
<p>Penny is here revisiting Bastian who he has worked on before. Having delved a bit into global/transnational history literature, he comes across quotes in Bastian's oevre that give him a different view of the man. He sees ways in which Bastian was avoiding closure in his theoretical vision. The most compelling places in which Penny sees this are in Bastian's vision of his museum exhibits, which were to be open and not bounded, with few borders. A particularly compelling quote from an 1877 essay entitled ""<em>Ethnologische Erörterung"" </em> sounds like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the drive for a systematic closure is a natural wish in the human heart, but not every wish on earth can find its fulfillment. If the obvious impossibility of completing the entere building in the existing generation stands in front of ethnology, then there is no use in building ephemeral houses of cards to appease the impactience of spectators. (52) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Penny then writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For Bastian, the ideal ethnographic museum would contain material culture from all areas of the world and all periods of history. But it would not be constructed to articulate pointed narratives. Bastian favored open collections in which objects were arranged in cabinets made of glass and steel, flooded by natural light from large windows and glass ceilings, and position in such a way that scientists could move easily through the goegraphically organized displays, gain an overview of the objects from entire regions, and mae mental connections between the material cultures of people living in different times and places. This design differed markedly from art museum, ntural history museums, or even colonial musums and exhibitions taht gained populatiy alter in the century. No particular object, grouping,&nbsp; or arrangement was supposed to stand out or be emphasized; there was no developmental series of artificats; and the museum's goal was not explicitly pedagogical. Bastian's ddisplays were expcted to facilitate the location and exploration of the elementary characteristics of a unitary humanity -- the fundamental nature of ""the"" human being (52)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On this quote, Penny cites Bastian, ""Führer durch die Ethnograpische Abtheilung"" (Berlin: W. Spemann) , p.3 and <em>Königliche Museen zu Berlin, Führer durch das Museum für V</em><em>ölkerkunde, </em>2nd ed., Berlin, p.7</p>
<p>Ultimately, what Penny is up to&nbsp; is that he wants to point out that Bastian is a key precursor to transnational historigoraphy. Apparently, Osterhammel has already cited the Boasians as theorists of globalization: ""Osterhammel's eigtheen and nineteenth centuries are full of global thinkers who ultimately produce the Boasians we continue to embrace; thinkers whose work on globzieation he reminds us, should not only be noted, but taken seirously."" (53) Penny wants to add that Bastian may be helpful in showing us the link fro Alexander Humboldt to Boas, but also for his ""insights into the multiplicity of humanit and the flows of&nbsp; human histories.""

"""The Foundations of All Future Researches"": Franz Boas, George Hunt, Native American Texts, and the Construction of Modernity","p. 486 - 491 The ""Collaborative Production"" of Texts

They focus on Boas' relatiopnship to Hunt (and don't conside rhis relation to Henry Tate and others).  

-- Boas encountered resistance from some sources who had forgotten tales or would not relate them.  Boas wrote about recalcitrant Clatsop speakers: ""The women were not able to grasp what I wanted; they claimed to have forgotten their myths and traditions, and could not or would not give me any connected texts.""  (quoted from Chinook Texts Bureau of Ethnology, Bulletin No. 20 (Washington, D.C., 1894).  The authors describe Boas's attempts to overcome such resistance as a ""synecdochic instance of colonial relations."" (487)  Why? Their was objectification of people's traditions -- for ""sale""  and so they say the scientific enterprise was ""part of larger structures of political-economic exchange."" (487)    f.n. 18 in Berman's book, she notes that Hunt asked for funds to pay elders for stories.  And Boas was in a position of power here and used money as a threat, so he threatened hunt that the museum would cut off funds if Hunt did not produce work.  (487)  And Stocking noted that Boas notes recurring ""...""expressions of vexation when an uncooperative Indian slowed up Boas's work or wwasted his time with an 'idiotic' story, or when he found it necesssary to become 'a little rough' with informats in order to make 'their attitude improve.'"" (486-487).   (that from 204 in Stockings Race, Culture..."") 

-- The authors also note that Boas' instructions to hunt steered Hunt toward the collection of ""old"" objects and associated stories or texts -- and ""[t]his reciprocal associaiton between texts and artifacts increased the value of both sets of objects through reciprocal processes of traditionalization and authentification."" (489  Boas they say was particularly interested in ""traditional speech."" (489)  He wrote to Leohnhard Shultze-Jena t Phillips University in Marburg (Germany) to say ""We are at the present time engaged in a systematic study of American Languages.  We want particularly to rescue the vanishing forms of speech."" (quoted on 489, from Boas to Schultze-Jena, 10 Sept.1928, American Phil. Soc).

-- Boas also instructed Huntn about the thematic focus and long-range interests of his work and the collections than needed to be done.  The authors describe these instructions as ""a guide to the entextualizaiton of 'Kwakiutl' culture"" (490)  They say his focus shifted ""over the years from technology and foodways to ethnozoology and ethnobotany to social organization and finally to 'the way the Indians think and feel.'"" (490)

-- And Boas sent the end-products of Hunt's work to Hunt.  The authors note that such a tome might have suggested to Hunt not only that ""geographically bounded Native Ameircan communities could be represented through a variety of texts publishe din book form"" but also they would have ""provided models of the sorts of narrative structures, rhetorical parameters, and stylistic features that constitute this type of representation."" (490)  But the authors note that Boas did not allow Hunt to develop this kind of awareness which they desire as ""intertextual relations"" (490) Instead, Boas remained dubious of the quality of their work, its syntactic accuracy and of Hunt's ""authority to represent 'Kwakiutl culture'"" (491)"
Beyond Separate Spheres: Intellectual Roots of Modern Feminism,"<p>p.162- 168 Exposure to Ethnology  Moves to D.C. when her husband is elected in 1905.  Is there until 1911.  Not an easy time.  D.C. more conventional.  But she stays with ethnology.  She goes to Phillipines on congressional junket with William Taft in 1905, and it is a kind of exposure to fieldwork Rosenberg says. (162).  Also her look at D.C. culture is a kind of fieldwork.  (162).    Rosenberg says that Parsons was alwyas skeptical of Giddings evolutionism.  She liked Bosa' work Rosenbergg says.  Rosenberg quotes Boas from 1942 about why anthropology appealed to Parsons as a woman.  This is interesting, but a bit anachronistic for her to use in this context.  (164).  Boas' she notes was more egalitarian, and he also believed that social habit constructed people's abilities (like Helen Thompson e.g.), but Rosenberg also notes thatwhile he was open to women's participation he did not necssariy encourage it.  (see 166)...Women came into the department hwne he was exile d to Banard durin gWWI.  and women came to him as they had Giddings (166).  Also Rosenberg notes that Boas was older and so not threatened by the women.  (166)   Parsons thought ethnology could be helpful.  Sociology she said ""never seriously considered societies other than those related to or constituting our own civilization."" (166)   Rosenberg makes a funny observation: ""In a curious way, Parsons complemented Boas's work among primitive peoples.  Whereas Boaslooked at the Eskmos and saw himself, Parsons looked at her friends and saw primitive people. "" (167).    Parsons fieldwork was limiited prior to WWI, but she went to the field in the Southwest in 1910, 1912, and 1913.  By 1915 Rosenberg says she was ""addicted"" to fieldwork trips.  (167)</p>"
A category of the human mind: the notion of person; the notion of self,"p. 03 Recency of the Self

NOTES: What is this of the self in terms of the Other?"
Women in the Professions: A Research Agenda for American Historians,"p. 279 - 281  Women in 19th Century Workforce & 1st Generation of Prof. Women	

Note that the ""powerful idea of a leisured female class, busily perpetuating a 'cult of domesticity,' has diverted our attention from the very real economic necessity that moved many women who were neither urban, immigrants, nor laboring poor into the work force."" (279)

They note that rural New Englanders sent their daughters into teaching and millwork for the skae of a ""family economic strategy""  regarding such training ""as a good investment for a daughter's future, inasmuch as it provided skills for marriage, allowed for the possiblity of accumulating a meager dowry, and protected against a destitute widowhood."" (279) 

Moreover the disruption of the ""family economy"" sent some women to work, when they lost a male head of househood for eample.  Two examples are writing or placement in the expanding federal bureaucracy.  Cindy Aaron has written of the latter in ""To Barter their Souls for Gold: Female Clerks in Federal Govenment Offices, 1862-1890, JAH 67, 4 (March 1981): 833-53.  Ann Douglas has written of the writing option, but can't find citation in paper.

Such need to support oneself drove some women to work, but the authors' speculate that once they went to work, other motives developed.  they find this argment in Scott & Tilly's book Woman, Family and Work.  ""In other words,"" they write""a familial orientation toward work gave way to a more autonomous impulse to develop or fulfill one's own interests and aspirations."" (279) (279-280) 

Work then could b ea way to achieve independence from family constraints, but the tensions between the two were very difficult (280).  Tensions between family and work could be very difficult as seen in biographies of feminists such as Angelina Grimke and Charlotte Perkins Gilman, see bios by Mary Hill and Gerda Lerner."
History: Professional Scholarship in America,"p.072 Break down of historians' public at turn of century

Higham say s that audience or public of historians that had existed in the
19th-century began to disssapear.  ""Beneath the obvious ferment of progressivism, a deeper change in the intellectual temper--less specific, less easy to define--worked in the same antihistorical direction.  The genteel and conservative cultural standards with which history had long associated itself were breaking down.  A passion for intense life, for the vitality of immediate experience, was challenging the dignified, elevated attitudes that history had always suggested.  The impetuous modern temper did not become fully evident until the 1920's, whereupon a reaction against it appeared; but the historical spirit was already reaching a low point as early as 1905, when even the costume novel went clearly out of fashion."" 

Higham then also reports a failure to speak to a general audience.  Beard's An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution (1913) sold fewer than 8,000 copies over four decades ""and then only with the aid of asecond edition published during the Constitutional crisis of the 1930's."" (72)  

Witness quote by AHA secretary in 1917: ""It is customary, he said, to regard historical scholarship as 'a harmless,though amiable pursuit, butone of little if any 'practical' use, and to look upon the student of history as a perosn who, having too few red corpuscles in his blood, is content to bury his head in the dust of the past, oblivious to the interests and exigencies of the present."" (72) 

Also come control over curriculum began to wane just prior to WWI.  ""First civics, then other contemporary 'social studies,' demanded recognition for ocontributing to 'social efficiency.' History had patriotic uses; otherwise it was something of a bore."" (73)"
"Margaret Mead, the Samoan Girl and the Flapper: Geographies of Selfhood in Coming of Age in Samoa","00 Summarial Note 00 

Firstly, this article is a good source for the popular reception and interpretation of Mead's book.  It quotes and categories many of the responses contianed in reviews of her book.  Overall the response to the book was positive by the popular press (39).  Elite magazines were more skeptical such as Menken who disliked Mead's applications of the problems to American life.  (39)

The basic argument of the book is that Mead's Coming of Age in Samoa contributed to a popularly conceived ""social problem"" : the flapper, see 35-36.  The flapper being a product of mass culture who was rebellious and stood for heteroxeual fun.  She spent time in movie houses, automobiles, speakeasies, and jazz clubs.  She appeared in movies and in Lewis's Main Street as Carole Milford and in F. Scott Fitzgerald's novels, women like Myra St. Calire, Isabelle, rosalind connage, Eleanor Savage, and Jill in This Side of Paradise who ""compel Amory Blaine to self-knowledge..."" (35) 

The article summarizes the book and the circumstances of its publication.  Then towards the end it starts to make arguments about a connection between modern conceptions of selfhood, spatialized selfhood as a hidden selfhood and self as child which she draws from a book by Carolyn Steedman, and the Samoan girl that Mead uses to characterize the Samoan culture.  She describes in the end through the reception of Mead's book that the book was received ambivalently, such that there was a mixture of envy and superiority in relation to the Samoan girl.  But her argument vis-a-vis the self is not clear.

so Molloy ultimately suggests that Coming of Age in Samoa emerged in the midst of an era in wich the ""flapper with all her association of freedom, modernity, and rejection of the constraints of traditional femininity, represented lost gender, generational and sexual certainty.""  (46)  She also notes that Mead's attempted to mediate these problems and suggest that anthropology through its study of these people could offers solutions... but Molloy does note here the flow of th Other into the modern self... 

Also interesting is Molloy's point that Mead was often pictured as a Samoan girl...and described as the ""girl anthropologist"" or the ""girl scientist"" and some reviewers Molloy noted that the success of her work was ""due to the fact that she had 'identified herself so completely with the Samoan youth.'"" (46)"
Lost Manhood Found: Male Sexual Impotence and Victorian Culture in the United States,"p. 41 -2  Late 19th Century Focus on External Cause of Impotence: Overcivilization & Neurasthenia

I.e. keeping the distinction between male/female bodies, they  move away from a focus on morality in terms of the male body.  They now look to ""external social pressures"" as a cause, and define ""overcivilization.""  George M. Beard's work is central here: he deifnes neurasthenia as a result of what circumstances of modern environment, e.g. ""...the 'necessity of punctuality,' 'railway travel,' and the 'disorderly city'"" (42)  Beard also described Sexual Neurasthenia but never finished his work, though book was published in 1884: ""Like general neurasthenia, sexual neurasthenia stemmed from the depletion of nervous energy, cauesd by overcivilization and the stifling quality of rationalized culture."" (42)

Neurasthenia treated body as a ""closed-energy system"" or what G.J. Barker-Benfield descirbes as a ""spermatic economy."" (42)  Again male/female body distinction maintained.  Sexual neurasthenia in women seen as causing infertility still.  Females also a closed-energy system, but within there is a ""cycle of fertility."" (42-3)

Beard's notion of neurasthenia rooted also in Spencerian social development.  Notion of ""arrested development"" is there.  The idea that certain people can't control impulses, in particular sexual instincts.  Beard and others used these ideas.  White working-class men and blacks therfore were seen as sexual potent and immune to neurasthenia (for blacks see 45-48
).  White middle-class men then were in a kiind of crisis: they were over-civilized, controled but sexually impotent.  (44)  This led to an idealization of the artisan or working  classes: ""Thus some middle-class men idealized (or paraodied) the artisan, even as they became more and more enmeshed in corporate bureaucratices that eroded the autonomy and appropriated the skills of the craftsmen."" (45)

In conclusion, Mumford says that ""Beardian Science""  represented full development of 19th century debility theory.  But on the other , in its recognition of the difficult conflict between civilization and sexual impotence, it indicated the next development..."
Proletarianization and Educated Labor,"<p>00 Summary Note 00  Larsons' s discussion of professionalization is useful primarily from the theoretical perspective, but also historical-empirical.   His question here is primarily to assess the position of the professional classes in relation to Marx's theory of alienation, by questioning whether the professional classes experienced a process of ""proletarianization.""  The article is useful both because of the conclusion it draws and its summary of Marx's theory of alienation and proletarianization.  Whereas Larson describes Marx's description of the alienation of the manufacturing classes as having three stages (economic, organizational, and technical) which he says all ""fuse"", the last of these, technical alienation, is not something that professionals experience, nor is the fusing of the three forms of alienation.  See 138-140, for descriptio nof alienation of the manufacturing class.  This is significant because it technical alienation that in Larson's words ""simplification and homogenization of industrial tasks eliminate preexisting skills and destroy the <em>individual's</em> indpendent assets, his bargaining power on the labor market."" (139)  Larsons analysis of the professional case folows p. 139 and his conclusion as stated above is made through a fairly detailed sociological analysis.   pgs, 147, 170 for absence of tech. alienation and no fusing.   Larson stresses in particular that b/c the professional system provides a relative degree of advantages that it offers also ""a wide field for individual  experiences of relative deprivation which, under certain conditions, may  come to beinterpreted subjectively as 'proletarianization.'"" (145) That said he maintains that b/c there is no technological alienation and no fusing of the three forms of alienation (147), the ""choice of getting a degree can still be seen as an individual strategy against proletarianization in the labor market."" (147)  -- and on 147, top, he also notes that the credential is a defensive measure against comp. with those who have no degree at all.  That said there are factors that make the ""objective"" situation of the professional different than the ideal situation of the professional, and Larson  stresses intelligently that the professional can experience this as a very large betrayal.  E.g.: ""...oversupply and internal stratification can bring bout under-utilization and wastage of knowledge and skills for <em>specific</em> cohorts and categories of educated workers.  the waste of one's abilities is, ast least, an experience of stunted growth which may be lived as a deep social betrayal of the self."" (151)  Larson also picks up this theme at the end again when he writes ""[o]rganizational alienation may still be lived by many educated workers with unconscious reference to an image of the autonomous professional, entitled to privilege by his education and by his benign contributions to the social welfare.  The failure to secure expected rewards is...an important experience.  Its effeccts depend on the complex relationship between  a worker's sense of 'entitlement,' his or her actual owrk life and the compensations of life out of work.  When a society promises advancement through education but witholds its rewards, cynicism and anger are easy..."" (170)  There is a lot here, especially in terms of description of the particular forms of alienation that professionals experience and their causes. It is worth reading more closely when necessary.  Didn't take full notes due to time.  Other issues.</p>"

(41)  Death of his wife in 1831 cuts him loose from church and society in Boston... (41)</p>
<p>42 -- Emerson divides the self from the owrld...referring ""Nature and the Soul"", that is by nature he meant ""everything other than the soul."" (42)  The ""ME"" and ""NOT ME."" (42)</p>
<p>42-43 -- Sklansky ties this into a ""pervasive concern in antebellum New England with the rupture of the conventional relationship between self and world due to the market revolution."" (42)  That is, to the ""breakup of the nity of human labor and means of production (farmland, workshop) that formed the basis of indivdual agency (civic virtue as well as self-interest) in the ealry republic."" (42) In classical political economy this appeared to be a ""division of the sovereign self,"" but Emerson reinterpreted the symptom.  The trouble in Emerson's analysis was the ""soul's alienation from nature"" (42) which was itself the product of classical political economy itself...because it had linked the selfhood to property ownership, to  a notion of selfhood based on mastery... (42) On ""Understanding"" in Coleredige's use of the term to mean the opposite of Reason and Intuition... (see 36-37).</p>
<p>43 -- Emerson maintained that becoming receptive rather than masterful the individual would acquire ""property"" in the ""spiritual kingdom."" (443)  E.g. ""The charming landscape which I saw this mornig, is indubitably  made up of some twenty or thirty farms...Miller owns this field, Locke that, and Manning the woodland beyond.  But none of them owns the landscape.  There is a property in the horizon which no man has but he whose eye can integrate all the parts, that is, the poet.  This is the best part of thes men's farms, yet to this their warranty-deeds give no title."" (Emerson quoted on 43, from <em>Nature</em>. )</p>

A Four-Fold Humanity: Margaret Mead and Psychological Types,"p.190 Embodiment

Sullivan argues taht Mead and Bateson sought what is now called ""embodiment"" and he cites Csordas , Embodiment and Experience (1994); Csordas Introduction: The body as representation and being-in-the-world (1994b)

He quotes Mead's statement to the Committee for Research in Dementia Praecox.  She wanted by ""working in a closed 'area of homogenous culture andcommon racial background,' she hoped to find a society in which temperament and character joing together in a sufficiently coherent and clear pattern--itself consistent with the culture as a whole--that she and Bateson could adequately control for variations of temperament and character in the target population."" (190)  

Sullivan puts it like this: ""...Mead was seeking what metaphorically one could call elementary forms of these conjunctions of relations between temperament, character, and culture, forms each with their own distinct morphological developments, and hence what would now be understandable as their own distinct process of embodiment."" (190)"
Herbert Spencer on Women: A Study in Personal and Political Disillusion,"(( Summarial Note ))

The basic argument here is that Spencer's views on women changed -- form espousing equality in hi s early volume Social Statistics (1851) to gutting this view and espousing women's role in the household in his later works such as the revise and abridged version of Social Statistics (1892) -- due to his own failure to form a strong bond to a woman.   Gray calls this a ""psychological"" development.  (256)    And says that Spencer attrivbuted his failure to develop a relaitonship ""to the deficiencies of the opposite sex."" (256)   

The first two parts of the essay track the original statement s of Spencer on women and then track the changes.  The last section examines the ""psychological development""  that Gray thinks provide the rational for Spencer's shift.

The argument here is kind of great.  There is lots good material on Spencer's views on women and on his frustration.  The point seems to be 1) that he was afraid of the family, saw it as akin to slavery, and 2) that he was more deeply also afraid of a perceived threat of a woman's intense love to his ""bodily integrity.""  (263)  In the conclusion to the article, Gray points out that Spencer feared the same incursion on his body from the state: ""Women were a symbol of his fear of loss of bodily integrity, he could not bring himself to submit his person to the state.  The two threats become interwoven: women and the state were onjoined in his imagination. If women participated in the state, there would be no security for personal integrity.  Spencer's crusade against the state had become embodied in a crusade agianst women."" (267-8)  I think Gray is speculating here, for he has not presnted evidence of this latter claim through Spencer's own words, and the last sentence seems to me to be an exageration.  But it is plausible that Spencer connected these two."
"Karl Popper -- The Formative Years, 1902-1945","<p># Malachi Haim Hacohen, <em>Karl Popper -- The Formative Years</em>, 1902-1945 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000)</p>
<p>&gt; Notes 10/12: The point here was to get a sense of the way Hacohen treats what earlier German historians talked about as Bildung and the dilemmas of Jewish middle-class liberals in Central Europe in general...Dirk had said that the lit on Jewish culture int his period has changed a lot since the critique of the <em>Sonderweg</em> that still dominated in the 1970s. So even text's like Mosse's <em>German Jews Beyond Judaism</em> is still&nbsp; under the sway of this basic narrative, whcih is perhaps also as Dirk put it, a ""narrative of decline."" How is Hacohen different, or is he? In a way, as Dirk also acknowledged, he is still partaking of this kind of decline narrative in order to support his identification of Jews -- and Popper specifically -- as having devleoped a kind of Jewish cosmopolitanism.... I am not so sure about the politics or tendencies of Dirk's critique. To what extent does his critique come from a jsutified and valuable desire not to reproduce the <em>Sonderweg </em>vv German history as a whole, but a general disinterest or even suspicion that exceeds my own about identify politics -- (ie in this case vv Jews)?</p>
<p># Introduction</p>
<p>* Key point here is that he's presenting Popper as someone who confronted the modernist currents of&nbsp; ""nonfoundationalism"" that circulated in fin-de-siecle Vienna (see Toulmin and Janik's <em>Wittegenstein's Vienna</em>), but without giving up his progressive and outlook. A key quote is on p.3, where Hachohen brings up Rorty's <em>Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature</em> and Rorty's nonfoundationalism in general:</p>
<p>&gt; Nonfoudnationalism reflected the crisis of representation, the recognition that language not only described the world but also created it. Subjects did not conceive of objects; rather, subjectivity and objectivity were themselves historically contingent discursive chimeras, a prodcut of modern philosophy since Descartes. The postmodern rid itself of them. Rorty used Dewey, Heidegger, and Wittgenstein to illustrate nonfoundationalist options. Had he used Popper, he might have saved the contemporary academy some detours. Contemporary debates are a <em>deja vu</em> to anyone familiar with the fin-de-siecle and interwar scences, especially in Vienna. Popper and his interwar interlocutors recognized 'poststructuralist' dilemmas -- they simply opted for different solutions. I am eager to recommend their solutions as against poststructuralist ones."" (3)</p>
<p>* Later he writes: ""Popper refused to split the life of reason or action, or give up on the 'scientific worldview' that he had intherited from the Viennese late enlightenment (<em>Spaetauflaerung)</em>..."" (5) He then drops in a quote from Popper on 5. On the first page of Ch.1, Hacohen repeats this basic point saying that Popper is the Spaetauflaerung's ""most renowned twentieth-century represenative."" (23)</p>
<p>* Popper was launching his critique, Hacohen says, from a ""marginal Kantian perspective foreign to logical positivism."" (6) And his basic cosmopolitanism ""originated as a solution to the dilemmas of ethnic idnetify faced by the assimilated Jewish-Viennaese intelligentsia."" (5) At the end of this last stence, Hacohen cites his article on the ""Dilemmas of Cosmopolitanism"" that has made such an impression on me.&nbsp; Popper's ""Open Society"" he says expressed this groups ""hopes of integration into a community that discounted religion, ethnicity, and nationality."" (5)</p>
<p># Ch.1 ""Progressive Philosophy and the Politics of Jewish Assimilation in Late Imperial Vienna""</p>
<p>* Popper's intellectual and cultural context, Hacohen implies was somehow not represented in the picture of fin-de-siecle Viennese modernist culture that have emerged, e.g. in toulmin and Janik's <em>Witgenstein's Vienna</em>. And Popper himself objected to Toulmin and Janik's account. As Hachohen writes; ""The vienna he knew -- progressive, optimistic, reform oriented -- virtually disappeared from accounts of modernism. Social reform, not cultural crisis, prevailed in his Vienna 1900."" (23)</p>
<p>* Popper's household he says ""embodied the ideals of <em>Besitz </em>(property), <em>Recht</em> (law), and <em>Kultur</em> (culture) that were held in the highest esteem by Viennese liberals."" (24) Hacohen describes the family as having ""renounced their membership in the Jewish community..."" (24) by converting to Lutheranism. Simon Popper, Karl's father, ""preferred the <em>Aufklaerung's </em>religion."" (24) But thiese ideas and their conversion did not break the ""barriers of ethnicity."" (24) Hacohen says that ""[t]he assimilated Jewish intelligentsia constructed bridges to progressive secular Austrians opposed to anti-Semetism, but therew were relatively few of these."" ""Secular pgoressive Germans,"" he says, ""were marginal to their own ethnic group."" (24) And German-Austrians did not socialize with Jews. So ""The Poppers spent much of their life int he company of Jews."" (24)</p>
<p>* At the same time, though, Popper was srurounded by ""progressive intellectuals"" who critiqued ""the social conservtaism of mainstream liberalism"" and ""soughta nd opening for workers."" (24) They ""opted for a bourgeois-proletarian alliance, under the auspices of bureaucracy, that would promote social legilistaion, economic modernization, and scientific education."" (24)</p>
<p>* Hacohen sets up Popper as someone who spent ""much of his life refashioning progressive philsophy and politics."" (25) He pushed opposition to ethnonationalism farther, rejecting the notion of <em>Deutschtum</em>, that was for his parent's generation all a piece and he began to advocate a radical cosmoplitanism. He also rejected all religion and advocated for an international legal order and defended teh Enlightenment and Open Society. (25)</p>
<p>* In setting up the context, Hacohen describes ""Viennese Jery in the Age of Franz Joseph"" in the first section of the chatper.&nbsp; This ear (1830-1916) was short-lived as a golden age. Austria had been referred to as the ""alnd of blood"" after the the murder and expuslion of Jews in 1420-1. (25) Emancipation came with the 1848 revolution: they were granted equal citizneship and residential and occupational restritions were abolished. (25)</p>
<p>* 26-30 He goes through some family details, ahving said that their families' history ""refelected general migration patterns for Habsburg Jews."" (26) On 30-34 he deals with the sociolgoical dimensions and dynamics of Jewish assimilation vv Simon Popper. This is the part most interesting to me. Simon Popper he describes as somone who ""joined <em>Besitz </em>with <em>Kultur</em>."" (29) He worked hard and he read widely, had a huge library of 14K volumes. (29) ""The young Popper found himself surrounded wiht culture at its best."" (29) In general, Hacohen explains the Jewish population. There were 72K in Vienna by 1880 and 175K by 1910. They were merchants and professionals (but for every 1 Jewish merchant there were 4 catholic ones.). (29) 1/2 of medical doctors were Jewish and 3/5 of lawyers. They also owned most of the papers and espeically the <em>Neue Freie Presse</em> which was a major ""organ oof libreal public opinion."" (30) According to Steven Beller, the rise to culutral prominent of Jews had to do with the eduational patterns. Only a very few of the non_jewish Middle class sent their children to the gymnasia, wich was a basis for university admission and a profssional career.And most sons of Austrians went either into teaching or adminstration. (30)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Acculturation to German culture, Hacohen says, ""created a crisis of identity"" for Jews. ""Jews resopnded variously, some endeavoring to assimilate, others reaffirming traditional identity, yet others inventing secular Jewish nationalism."" (30) In Popper's family the response was narrower between German acculturation and limited partiaption in the Jewish community. (30-31) The ilmits to assimilation were&nbsp; 1) that Austrian-Germans ""were not willing to accept Jews."" (31) So that both assimilated and non-assimilated Jews ""belong to the same social networks."" (31) 2) Ethnicity therefore still determined residential patterns. (32) 3) Educational patterns reinforced these separations, as Jews were concentrated and the majority in certain schools of the city (1st, seocnd and ninth). Poitn was that in&nbsp; the end Viennese Jews were not Austrian Germans; they ""constituted a German-Jewish community fo their own, united by ethnic origins, social class, German education, the Enlightenment's ethos, liberal politics, and of course, the anti-Semitie's malice."" (32-33)</p>
<p>* Until WWI, liberal Jews controlled the <em>Kultusgemeinde</em> which was an ""organization to which every Jews was required by law to belong..."" (33) What he describes as modern ""western or liberal Jews were a majority in Vienna and in the Behomenan crown lands. (33) To the extent taht they viewed Jews as a Volk or Stamm the leaders of this group believed Jews to be ""united by religion aleon."" (33) Moreover, the ""liberals read the German <em>Aufkalerung</em> into Judasim and psoke of Jews' universal mission: sprading monotheism, the golden rule, egalitarian citizenship, and cosmopolitanism."" (33) The Viennese fhief rabbi Adolf Jellinek, 1865-1891, argued that ""Jewish people transcended national existence and testified to cosmopolitanism's viability by becomeing exemplary citizens in their repsective nations.In Austria, this meant that Jews were German: <em>Aufklaerung, Emanzipation (</em>emancipation)<em>, Bildung, and Deutschtum</em> were all one."" (33) [Notably he does nto specify here how this might ahve been different for Jews in Germany... or was there not yet a Germany then and so not relevant. But waht about Boas' family, all the way up in Minden.]</p>
<p>* This reading of the Aufklaerung into Judasim was not as momon among ""Eastern"" Jews -- those who were a majority in Galacia. ""They regarded Jews a sa seprate popekle, united by observance of Jewish law,&nbsp; religious tradition, language (Yiddish), and common ancestry."" (33)&nbsp; In the 1880s, Ostjuden began to arrive in Vienna, and showed little interest in the Kultusgemeinde. (34)</p>
<p>* In a section on Liberalism and anti-semetism and Vienesse progressivism, 34-46, Hacohen describes the growth and transformation of <strong>Vienesse liberalism among non-Jews.</strong> It was dealt a blow after the 1848 revolution but had a resurgence in 1860 after the defeaetd in teh Italian War. See 34-35. Beteween 1867-and 1879, liberal ""led almost al Austrian cabinets..."" (35) Liberals he says spoke of <em>Duetschtum</em> anad that meant full citizenship for all ""who exhibited the solid character of German <em>Buerger</em>."" (35) He notes that <em>Deutschtum</em> was both ""culturally and socially acquired -- Jews who attained property and education were, in principle, welcome."" (36). Liberals also believed that German culture needed to be ""spread to backward nationalist in Central and Eastern Europe."" (36)</p>
<p>* He then traces the challenge posed to liberals by rising ethnocentric German nationalism and anti-semetism, whcih in Austria was&nbsp; in part a result of&nbsp; the ""ineluctable dilemmas of Austrian-German national identity."" (37)"": ""In a multinational empire, German nationailsm could only mean the dismemberment of the Austrian state that libearls aspired to lead."" (37)&nbsp; The liberals had turned to German nationalism as a source for a much needed ""new vision to unify the middle classes under their leadership."" (36)&nbsp; <strong>This move was typial across Europe Hacohen notes where liberal elites ""faced with democratization deployed social reform or natioanilsm, or both, to fashion new communities."" (37) </strong>But in Austria wehre there were many ethno-natioanlist tensions, ""the cominbatyion was deadly. Resurgent populist German and Czech nationalism collided, and the Jews were caugh in between."" (37) In 1880, the liberal set up the <em>Deutscher Schulverein</em> (German school association) with the aim of promoting German langagueand culture. At this moement, they also ""religuished pretensions [held earlier, see p.36)] to being the state's party and becamea dvocates of particular ethnic interests. They now aimed to secure, they said, the <em>Natioanl Besitzstand</em> (national property ownership). Within two decades, an ever-diminishing and fragemented liberal camp normalized anti-Semetism and undermined its own preivous universalist ideals."" (37)</p>
<p>* In 1885, then, the United Left(Vereinigte Linke) split over whether Autrian should e put in its title. Then the populist nationalist left set up their own <em>Deutscher Club</em>. The question was who belogned in their vision of the German nation? In 1882, Jews along with anti-Semites were still included in the ""progressive nationlist"" 1882 Linz program. (37) But this changed. Local branches soon moved to exclude Jews. The liberal leadership tried to disovle the local brnaches. And then in response there were defections in 1886, of the future Pan-German leader George von Schoenereer and the popular nationalists. For these people Jews were not German because ""<em>Deutschtum&nbsp; </em>was ethniuc (or racial) not cultural."" (37)</p>
<p>* This shift had great consequences for Jews becasue the liberals were the ""only party committed to retaining Jewish emancipation."" (38) Hacohen describes this shift as causing the closing of doors that had only just opened. (38, bottom). Mnay liberal Jews thsu relized in response taht they ""shared a common interest with the goverment, the emperor, and the <em>Verwaltung</em> in preserving the multinational empire's integrity, even against the German nationalists."" (39) But increasingly the government could not manage the tensions in various parts of the empire that emerged along with German nationalism, for instance in Bohemia where German nationalism triggered reactions among the Young Czechs. The government ruled more and more by ijmperial decree. (39)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* In the midst of this, Vienesse progressives, were frustratedwith liberailsm. ""They represented a small liberal minority that remained largely immunite to anti-Semetic populism. They continued their close cfooperating with the Jewish intelligentsia and were moving toward the socailkists."" (40)</p>
<p>* Simon Popper was evidently still attached to boutgeois liberalism in his lifetime. Hacohen describes his politics on 41-43). Then he describes others in Popper's family that could inspire with a more pgoressove vision, ie his uncle Walter Schiff. (43-45). Popper was indeed a defender of this progressive vision. Later he would defend it against the critique of people like Hayek (45-46).</p>
<p>* For progressives, ethnonationailsm was the ""greatest enemy."" But according to Hacohen they underestimated the threat. They fought anti-Semetism but ""they could see no harm in expanding the German cultural sphere (<em>Kulturbereich</em>) in Central Europe and regarded Slavic nationailsm as reactionary."" (46) They thought, in general,that ethnonationalism would dissapear with ""divergence socioeconomic development in the provicnes..."" (46) And they thought that anti-Semetism was rooted in ""religious prejudice"" and so opposed ""clericalilsm"" as their greatest enemy and not nationalism. (46)</p>
<p>* Progressives' imagined cpmmunities, though, were thoroughly universalist. They did not imagine their cosmopolitacal community as aggressively as did Kant, but still they ""denationalized the state."" (46) They did not define the a good social order according to cutlrual differences, but they were still attached to notions of Germanness: ""Undoubtedly, they confounded <em>Aufklaerung</em> and <em>Deutschtum</em>, but, for many, it seems, <em>Deutschtum</em> was an instrument for realizing <em>Aufklaerung</em>, rather than the opposite. They were less nationalists in a cosmopolitan guise than cosmpolitans in a German guise."" (47)</p>
<p>* Among progressives, then, the Popper family ""represented the cosmopolitan-pacifist pole"" (47) -- this pole was given clearest expression by freemasons and pacifists. (47) They were not interested in nationalism and saw Austria as a multinational empire. They thought that as such this empire was a ""higher development"" than the nation-state. Such cosmopolitans were Austrian patriots because of this support for the empire. Freemason cosmopolitans also had no paln for reform they were happy simply to see thesmelves as defenders of liberal values and as an ""intellectual elite of a huge states whose composition gave it the apperance of the international order of humankind in miniature."" (47)</p>
<p>* This kind of cosmopolitanism was rare though. Even the Habsburg court circles and the military bureaucracy did not present such an ideology.&nbsp; They presented a vision of an Austrian imperial idea or <em>Staa</em>ts<em>gedanke</em> but this lacked a cosmopolitan ideology. (47-48).</p>
<p>* Jews were hoewever ethnusiastic bearers of this kind of cosmpolitanism in Austria. Rabbi Jellinke wrote: ""If one could construct a specifically Austrian nationalisty...Jews woudl form its foundation."" (quoted on 48). Hachohen says also taht Jews had a hard time understanding why other nationalisties were not so enthusaistic about their dreams; ""Why sould Czechs not be equally content with integration into the German cultural sphere?"" (49)</p>
<p>* Not all Jews were by default cosmopolitan aptriots of Austria. They had to work to overcome their vision of Austria linked to the violence and pogroms of the past. Traditionalist Jews worked, e.g. Rabbi Bloch, ""made special efforts to reconcile orthodox Judaism with multinationalism"" but did not develop ""imperial cosmopolitan designs."" (49)Meanwhile, liberal Jews encountered identity struggles. They ""professed cosmpolitanism, but their cosmopolitanism conflicted with their German natioanlism, and anti-Semetism brought their Jewish-German synthesis, a mark of genuine cross-cultural interaction, into crisis. As long as <em>Deutschtum</em> was defined culturally, liberal Jews could regard themselves as its messengers to the <em>Ostjuden</em> and Slavs. Once it became racially defined, they faced exclusion from the German nation."" (50)&nbsp; Freud, Adler, and Friedjung -- alla ctive in German student asssociations -- encoutnered this early on as their fraternities chose to exclude Jews. (50)</p>
<p>* The liberal-cosmopolitanism of <em>Detuschtum</em> fell apart sby the mid 1890s. Even liberal Jews then had begunto have dbouts. Hachoen quotes from a 1897 meeting of the <em>Oesterrichisch-Israelitische Union</em> that called for a ""return to the pgoram of reconciliation of peoples (<em>Voelker</em>) and nationalities (<em>Staemme</em>), of all denominations, estates and classes in our fatherland, in the name of free thought and progress, of justice and equal rights of all citizens."" (50)</p>
<p>* Liberal Jews ""affirmed their cosmopolitanism"" most directly in their stand again Zionism. See 50-52).</p>
<p>* Popper's milieu was fully anti-Zionist. (51). Progressives and socialists both denied outright that Jews were a ""nationality."" (51) When in 1905 in Bukovina ""the center of Jewish Disaspora nationalism"", there was an attempt to establish a ""Jewish curia"" in themidst of electoral reform, progressive Jews in Vienna ""led a chage against the 'electoral ghetto' (<em>Wahl-Getto</em>)."" (52) Progressives ""repreresented a gorup that, to emancipate itself from its own ethnicty, neeeded to dissolve all ethncity an recover universalhumanity -- Marx's universal class,"" Hacohen writes.</p>
<p>*&nbsp; But this whole denial of ethnonationalism among progressives&nbsp; ""flew in the face of historical reality."" (52) Progressivism ""remained marignal."" (52)&nbsp; And he says ""ethnonationalism reisteed imperial management."" (52) There were attempts in the 1900s to accomodate these nationailst energies through compromises that set up national curiae in Moravia, Galcia, and Bukovina that reflected a "":search for equal rights of nationalisties."" (53) But these also supported notiosn of antioanl autonomy. A 1879 decision of the administrative high court&nbsp; that turned on how to decide the natioanl idenitty of bilingual members cited ""subjective"" factors: ""Belonging (<em>Zugeoerighkeit</em>) to a certain nationality [is] essentially a matter of consciousness and feeling."" (quoted on 53) But in the face of hypernationalists' attempts to exclude dissentiment memers Hacohen says the courts increasingly relied on ""tangible evidence."" (53)&nbsp; Ultimately Galcian Jews were denied citiznehip on racial grounds in the interwar period. ""Ethnonatioanlism turned multiculturalism on its head by reifying nationali idenity as race."" (53)</p>
<p>* Given this end Hachoen asks why the surpsise that Popper ""wished to cut throught he knot of national identity by decalring it false?"" (53) He says Popper say the dissolution of the Habsburg empire as an ""unmitigated disaster and held natioanilsm, especially German nationalism, repsonsible."" (53)</p>
<p>* His response was to reject both his German and Jewish natioanlism, a rare reposnse. and to ""favor an uncompromising nationalism."" (53) But this ""radicalism,"" Hacohen says,"" ""left Popper a permanent exile, a citizne oinly in an imaignary Republic of Science."" (53)</p>
<p>* Section on Austrian Progressive Philosophy makes some useful points vv how philosophy developed differently in the Austrian context. Key was the ""government repression of Kantianism during the French Revolution, the severe limits imposed on teaching philosophy in Austrian universities during the <em>Vormaerz</em> period (pre-1848), and the sanctioning of an official anti-idealist educational philosohpy in the aftermant of the great educational reform of 1853 that created the background fo the emergence of a scientific philoosphy."" (54) There was Hacohen says a tendency to pursue ""Catholic, scholaistic, and Lebnizian traditions that regarded the unviersa as a rational order and language as a reflecting a universal logic"" that survived in Austria while it was decimated by Kant's critiques elsewhere. (54) Prague philosphyer and priest Bernard Bolzano (1781-1848) articutelated tehse ideas and had a lasting inlufence. Also the anti-Kantian empiricist and Prussian philosopher Johann Friedrich Herbart (1776-1841). The most prominent philsopher, promoted by the ducation ministry, Robert Zimmermann (1824-98) become a professor in Vienna and his work synthesized Heberat and Bolzano. (54-55) Austria was howeer a backwater philosphically until Brentanto established his school. Brentano's philsophy ""used intentioanlity to distinguish etween mental and physical states, opening the door both to empirical inductrive approaches (Meinong) and to phneomenology (Husserl)."" (55) Brentano was also an enthusiiast of British empiricism, helping to introduce Mill's Logic. At the turn of the century, GE. Moore and Bertrand Russell became interested in the empirical bent of Austrian philosphers (their opposition to Kant and Hegel). And Moore and Russell's logic influence the Vienna Circle. : ""An Anglo-Austrian analytic axis emerged, empirical in its method, realist (anti-idealisti) in epistemology, respectful of natural science and pretheoretical commoon sense, and concerned with logical analysis."" (55)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* The confrontation between Hume and Kant became key in the Austrian context. Hume was an important philosopher and widely read. For Austrian empiricists and Kantian opponents (.e.g alois Riehl and robert Reininger), the Hume-Kant confrontation was key. Popper studied this confrnotation in the 1930s and unlike many Austrians declared allegiance to Kant. (56)</p>
<p>* Ernst Mach was hugely influential, and his ""netural monism,"" ""senatioanlism"" or ""phenomenalism"" as it was variously called. Popper thought it ""pernicious"". (56) But machwas influential. He rejected the subjet/object distinction (ie was not a Kantian) and saw ""expereince"" as ""nothing but a stream of sensations (<em>Flu</em>ss der Empfindungen)."" (56)</p>
<p>&gt; Science described sense data. ""Reality"" or ""substance"" were unknown. In science, the world appeared as a constellation of elements (*Weltelemente*), a structure of functional relationships of phenomena. Scientific theories described them in the simples and most ecnoomical terms, simpifying experience, and making prediction easier. Theories described, rather than judged, sense data. They were conventional, not true or false, but more or less useful. Causality , lawfulness, so-called&nbsp; natural laws, were scientists' creation, hypohtheses facilitating the organzation of experience and the making of predictions. Knowledge's sole criterion was reduction to expeirence....Immediate expeirence alone sanctioned a transition from common sense ot scientific knowledge. Any attempt to go bedyond experience woudl result in errors. Philosophy outside of sicence was futile."" (57)</p>
<p>* Mach thus suggested the science's ""mthodological unity"" needed to reset on ""physiolgocail terms"": on 1) psychology, ie the attempt to determine the assocations (<em>Verbindu</em>gen<em>) </em>of <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><em>represenations</em></span>; 2) physics, the attempt to discover the laws of assocaition of<span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><em> sensations</em></span>.""; nd 3) psychophysics, the attempt to ""clarify the laws of the association between sensations and representations). (57)</p>
<p>* Popper rejected Mach's view as early as his 1928 dissertation on methods of cognitive psych. He ""would develop an itneractions view of body and mind, supporting objetive knowledge."" (57)</p>
<p>* Mach, however, was very influential and Hachohen says ""virtually became the official philsopher of Viennese progressivism."" (57)</p>
<p>* But Mach also inspired a pessimistic resopnse in Firtz Mauthner, whose language critique, which servered langauge frmo reality was widely read in Vienna, though he lived in Berlin. (59-60)Mauthner basically saw langauge as only being able to show the limits of language. Hacohen writes that his ""critique began as an emancipatory project, endeavoring to free thought from verbal supersittiion (religion and metaphysics), but ended, like Wittgenstein, with mysticism and a call for silence."" (60)</p>
<p>* But Hacohen says, ""*Spaetaufklarung*"" could not proceed on such gruonds [as Mauthner established]."" (60) And he says sthat the Vienna circle and Popper ""had to find answers."" So they attempted to ""reconstruct scientific langauge"". Popper thought that goal a mistake b""but had to offer some way of closing the gap between reality and language. ""Expeirence (or scientific experiment), he argued, could show language (or theory) to have been wrong. No guarantee it would do so, but one could learn from error."" (60)</p>
<p>* The presence of the critiqeu of language (Mach-Mauthner axis) Hacohen says ""discloses the proximity of late enlightenment and Viennese modernism."" (60) Here is Hacohen's historiographical piont coutner Schorske and a vision of Viennese culture that ""originated in the 1960s and 1970s"". According to Schorske it was this moderni pessimism that was dominant: ""To Schorske, liberalism's retreat and 'politics in a new key' gave rise to modenrism in literature and the arts. Modernism reflected the dissolution of bourgeois orderliness and progress. <em>Bildung </em>foundered; the ideal of a well-formed charachter, of psychological balance and ethical responsibility, vanished. In stepped visions of a chaotic universe, social decadence, instinctual life, psychologcal torment, and morbitidy. Self-expression became the guiding principle. Intellectuals withdrew from politics to their studies and studios, surriptittiously disclosing their political anxieties in science, art, and literature."" (60).&nbsp; BUT Hacohen thinks this picture does not capture the people in Popper's mileu.!! Among these progressives, there was continuity with the ""old liberalism"" and a certain ""hope in humankind's future"" as well as a dedication to ""social reform."" (61) He even attributes to them an ""effusive optimisim in the face of intractable imperial problems."" (61) The Enlightenment was allive in their thought he thinks. Basically he thinks they faced up to modernism. He refers to an account of Jodl in Schorsek's essay on Klimt, where Jodle appears as a ""bewildered liberal who delved into the <em>Modernismusstreit</em> (modernist controversy) to reaffirm told enlightenment against modernism."" (61) But Hacohen insists that ""he was a plolitically engaged philsopher, whose vice was not cultural despair but dogmatism, political naivete, and German nationlalism."" (61) He notes that Schopenhauer and Nietzsche did not so much heral liberalism's collapse in this mileu as they were widely read and ""calmly absorbed."" (61) He says that Popper faced the modernism with ""serenity.""</p>"
The Victorian Connection,"p. 82-83 Nonconformity (religious) background 

These thinkers have background in religious nonconformity.  In evangelicalism...   They are ""modern missionaries"" also in that they believe in protesting the surrounding cutloure and offering something spritually higher.  
They ranked spiritual things higher than material.  (83)  Unitarianism imporant.  Hall says it was akind of ""halfway house on the road away from orthodoxy to 'free religion' and skepticism."" (83)  E.g. J.S. Mill had relationship with Unitarianism. William J. Fox an important go-between beteween Philsophical Radicals and Untiarians.   But what came out of this was a ""connetion"" Hall says neither Unitarian nor Radical."

-- Period makred by civil rights.  Kennedy had established a Commission on the Status of Women... (387).  Friedan's The Feminine Mystique published, sparking feminist revival. (387)

-- Two historan, established, publish articles in 1964. David POtter, ""American Women and the American Character"" in John A. Hague, ed. Americna Character and Culture: Some Twentieth Century Perspectives (1964): 65-84; Carl Degler, ""Revolution Without Ideology: The Changing Place of Women in America"" Robert Jay Lifton, ed., The Woman in America (1964). Degler and Potter found that women still experienced discrimination.  Degler in particular though women had been consumed with individual interests and had abandoned ideology like many. (388)

-- Other historians looked beyond flapper in the 20s and found women more actively politically engaged.  Groups like the Naitonal Women's Trade Union League, the Naitonal League of Women Voters and the National Consumer's league seemed to provide evidence that women were involved in progressivism in the 20s.  (389)  

-- Others like James R. McGovern questioned the thoery of moral revolution (w/ flapper) in 1920s.  McGovern located it before WWI instead, downplaying the 20s emancipation period.  See McGovern ""The American Woman's Pre-World War I Freedom in Manners and Morals"" JAH LV (1968): 315-333. (390)

These historians Freedman say indicate a new ""attitude twoard women's history."" They looked at things more closely and at the political lives of women in the 20s.  ""While they were eager to praise the role women had played in political movements, their researched laid the foundaiton for recent works which are critical of failures of thewomen's movements to achieve lasting reform."" (390).  

-- She then treats these books that were critical: William O'Neil's Rise and Fall of Feminism, which she doesn't like.  He provided antifeminist assessment of women's suffrage. and noted little progress in nonpolitical realms.

The Naturalized Female Intellect,"<p>p.221-  Nature/Nurture</p>
<p>To demonstrate new emphasis on general intelligence, She cites now Spencer who described women as being (in DAston's words  first) ""enmired in first impressions, 'incapable of balancing evidence""  (221)</p>
<p>For Spencer this wasa product partly of lack of experience, but  not exclusively.  Tehre were other factors: small brain size and and  ""under-developed nervous system."" (221)</p>
<p>What is going on here is new.  There is a link to the descriptions of female intellect of the late 18th century, but now there is also a new ""explanatory space, reocgnizably ordered along the divison between nature and nurture.""  (221)  (i.e. references to brian size and nervous system, and not only experience.  Women's position is not only or even mainly for Spencer a problem of use/disuse, which is the explanation that had been given before for the traits of the female intellect.</p>
<p>In Spencer this nature/nurture divison is not fully solid yet.  He used both use/disuse arguments and nature/nurture.  Daston asays it was later hteorists of intelligence like Galton that woudl finally separate the two into ""either/or compoenetns, utlimately to be qualifited by correlationsal statistics."" (221)  Galton supported the nature side, but his opponents used the same ""explanatory framework."" (221)</p>"
Approaches to Human Personality: William James and Sigmund Freud,"00 Summary Note 00

Lasswell looks at both Freud and James -- as two men who have influenced the vocabulary that is used to describe humans in the 20th Century -- and attempts to analyze both of the men in terms of a definition of series of potential factors roughly divided into circumstances + personality.  

The article is not all that useful for me and it is hard to say (though I read it quickly) what exactly he is arguing.  What is useful is his definition of personality on 56: ""...a term that designates basic stabilities of pattern observable during any selected cross-section of an individual's career from cradle to crypt.  We identify personality structure by examining how people act in relation to themselves and others in concrete situations.  Within the total 'process' we differentiatiate 'structure' and 'function' by assigning the term 'structure' to the principle predispositions with which an individual approaches a situation....Detached study might show that personality structure remained remarkably stable from early years; or we might isolate epochs of rapid oscillation or re-stabilization.""

Beyond Separate Spheres: Intellectual Roots of Modern Feminism,"p.046-  Breeakdown in notion of female uniqueness

Dewey hadintiially been wary of coeducation.  But he changed his mind (45-46).
Rosenberg thinks that ""The idealized view of womanly uniqueness, to which Dewey and his colleagues had all been bred in sexually segregated Victorian society, and which many of them had used to champion women's widening sphere, was beginning to break down in the face of simple quotidian experience. "" (46)  E.g. also Thomas changed his mind slightly after writing his dissertation, saying ""I do not wish to imply that this [sexual] difference is altogether inherent in the male and female disposition; it is, in fact, partly a matter of habit and attention.""

The Subject of Liberty: Toward a Feminist Theory of Freedom,"p.010-013 Positive Lib & Social Constructivism

Her critique of Taylor's defense of Pos. Liberty leads to another way that pos. lib. attacks neg. lib.  Social construction includes the idea of ""adapative preferences"" and ""oppressive socialization"" but it goes further, see esp. 12-13.

""By suggesting that people are <i>produced through</i>
social formations, and not simply <i>limited</i> by them, the idea of social construction thereby calls into question of what is genuine or true to the self and what is false.  As Kathy Ferguson puts it, 'It is not simply that [we are] being socialized; rather, a subject on whom socialization can do its work is being produced.'... 
...Who we are--the 'choosing subject'--exists within and is formed by particular contexts; the ideal of the naturalized and unified subject utilized by most freedom theory is thus deeply problematic and simplistically overdrawn.  The contexts in which we live, patriarchal, sexist, racist, and calssists though they may be, have produced women's, indeed everyone's agency."" (12-13)"
We Have Never Been Modern,"<p>Notes Summer 2014:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Section I: Crisis</p>
<p>Latour inveighs in this book against what he defines as the ""modern"". The modern is defined for him I think first and foremost by the effort to differentiate areas of knowledge into their own discrete categories and disciplines, all disciplines and categories in general, but expecially the divide between nature and culture. This is what he sees as the role of what he calls ""science studies"": ""...we are always attempting to retie the Gordian know&nbsp; by crisscrossing, as often as we have to, the divide that separates exact knowledge and the exercise of power -- let us say nature and culture."" (3) He&nbsp; believes that ""[o]ur intellectual life is out of kilter"" (5) as a result of this separation. Continues: ""Epistemology, the social sciences, th esciences of texts -- all have their privileged vantage point, provided that they remain separate. If the creatures we are purusing cross all three spaces, we are no longer understood..."" (5)</p>
<p>In taking up this issue, he's dealing with the issue of crisis of critique. See section 1.3, traces three responses: naturalization, socialization, and deconstruction. (5) These correspond to the subjects, respectively, of facts, power and discourse. (6) His point is that these things go together, always. And this is what he means by networks. And he says you can't basically have it both ways: either there are these ""networks"", or each of these themes -- power, facts, and discourse -- must be treated distinctly.</p>
<p>Anthropology, he thinks, has already shown what it is like to deal with networks in this manner. Because&nbsp; it treats all as linked inthe life of peoples, has shown the ""seamless fabric of...'nature-culture'..."" (7) This seems obvious, because these networks, these hybrids, are more obviously existant for the subjects of anthropology than they are for those of us who are supposed to be modern. ""...we are not savages; no anthropologist studies us that way, and it is impossible to do with our own culture... Our fabric is no longe rseamless. Analytic continuity has become impossible...."" (7)&nbsp; So then the question about why these networks are not studies is altered a bit...is it the case that there is not this seamlessnss in modern life, and thus it is impossible to analyze the linnks? He will ultimately say no! Because as the title of the book goes: ""We have never been modern...""&nbsp;</p>
<p>In section 1.4, he suggests 1989 is a date after which the existence of these networks has become clearer...(8-10). I find this sectiona&nbsp; bit hard to parse. Post-1989...nature no longer seems limitless, there has been damage to ecology, the triumph of liberalism is confronted with new organization on the global level to confront global ecological crisis. But not exactly clear to me how this brings up networks??</p>

Ernst Cassirer: The Last Philosopher of Culture,"<p>Notes Winter 2014:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ch. 1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ch. 2 Marburg School</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Summary of the Neo-Kantians relationship to Kant on 27-33. Key phrase that I found useful, that neo-Kantianism was born of a new ""ascetism"" in philosophy after 1848. (27)</p>
<p>* This was not a going back to Kant in an orthodox sense, but to fix the notion of aprorism. See O. Liebmann quote on 27-28.</p>
<p>* Notes that the first generation of neo-Kantians were understanding apriorism in a ""naturalistic sense."" (28) i..e they believed that these a priori categories of understanding that Kant had set up were grounded in the organization of our sensory system. (28).</p>
<p>* Skidelsky's focus though is the Marburg school, and here the focus was different: the point was by Cohen to go back to what he saw as the ""transcendental"" sense of Kant's notion of a priori. I.e. the point was not to look at psychological organization to ground the a priori, but to see the apriori categories as (quoting Cohen) ""formal or constitutional conditions of experience."" (quoted on 28). The point in other owrds, which Skidelsky gets to on the next page, is that ""[t]he transcendental question was no longer leveled at experience in general, but at experience as embodied in the concrete public institution of science."" (29) So that in effect ""all the key terms in Kant's transcendental theory undergo a change of meaning; they lose their foothold in in eternity, so to speak, and descend into human history."" (30) On 31 this starts to sound almost Habermassian (i.e. in terms of ideal speach sitution) when Sk. writes that this was about how ""the demand for universal validity remains the one fixed a priori of science."" (31)</p>
<p>* Section on how this was maybe also going back to Hegel that I've skipped for the moment.</p>
<p>* Then a section on the ways in which Neo-Kantianism and Kant in general was of appeal to Jews, i.e. Cohen Cassirer etc. (37-42) Why Kant? Because he'd created a philosophical space in which Jews and Christians could communicate, such that assimilation Sk. writes need no longer require ""the humiliation of baptism..."" (38) He goes on that Kant also being identified as a German philosopher was important: insofar as Kant was German, and he espoused this idea of a universal community, then he rperesented a Germany devoted to a ""Germany of the spirit."" Sk writes that Jews held up this ideal ""as an encouragement and a reproach to--and also sometimes as an escape from--the real Germany of Heinrich von Treitschke and Houston Stuart Chamberlin."" (38) These ""motives"" he says you could see in Cohen, and in Cohen's ""Jewish-German"" synthesis. He pegs an essay from Bruno Bauch, an influential philsopher and editor of Kant-Studien, as one in which the spectre of anti-Semetism was first raised in 1916. Bauch saw Kant's main revoluitonary aspect in his discovery of a sphere of ""validity and value."" But this significance was German according to Bauch. And he viewed Cohen as unable to understand this as a Jew. Lurking behind this was the question of whether to interpret Kant as a methodologist of science or a philosopher of culture -- and Bacuh's argument belongs to the latter, which connects him with the Southwest school of Neo-Kantianism, which was more conservative and ""mandarin"" than the Marburg school. ( 39-40) Bauch, though, Sk. notes was hitting Cohen at the most sensitive spot: because by claiming Kant as German, he was cutting of Cohen's Jewish-German synthesis. Bauch blocked Cohen from the whole German tradition: ""Anyone with an inkling of the spirit of German idealism can of course disregard the preoccupation of [certain]...Jews with 'ethics according to Kant, Schiller, and Fries.' However, I believe that not even a Jew of Cohen's intellectual rank can be properyly included in this spirit."" (quoted on 40.) Then Sk. interestingly goes on to look at the response in the Jewish community, which then also turned to a kind of nationalism, that of Rosenzweig and Martin Bububer... (41-42). </p>"
"Franz Boas: The Early Years, 1858-1906","<p>p.133-136 Description of Boas' early Method and Conceptualization of Anth</p>
<p>The description here is not incredibly technical.&nbsp; In my quick reading, I got these key points:</p>
<p>Boas is emphasizing the study of socil traits and eschewing physical anthropology.&nbsp; He beings by sutdying the myths customs and tradition of the Northwets Coast Indians in 1887-1888.&nbsp; He saw himself as using a ""statistical method"" (134) in which eh ""built up...a card catalogue of myth 'elements,' discreet portions of Ameican Indian myths arranged systematically to reval the occurence and absence of such elements amog vairous peoples across the continent."" (134)&nbsp; He is strying to understand ""thre growth of myths and their migrations"" as he says in 1891 (134) .&nbsp; A focus on ""psychology of dissemination and ammalgamation"" (134) Directed against independent invention. His cards showed that certain phenomena were always present.&nbsp; He finds that there is a common civilizaiton developing in th earea of the Northwest Coast.&nbsp; But there are also persistnet differneces, esp present on the level of ""distinct divison of social organization."" (135).</p>
<p>Overall goal described in 1887 as ""outlining the early history of mankind and working out the psycholgy of nations."" (Cole's words).&nbsp;&nbsp; Iits aim is ""the description of the history of mankind...beinginning from the first traces we find buries deep under the surface, up to the present time and in all parts of the globe.""&nbsp; To do this qould require that anths ""trace the history and distribution of every single phenomenon relation to th esocial life of man and to the pysical appearance of tribes."" This is from p. 231 in ""Anthropology in the american and British Associations for the Advancement of Science"" (1887)&nbsp; Two years later in 1889 attacks on Mason See 61-66 in Stocking <em>Shaping of American Anthropology</em>, Boas puts it in terms of communicating ""the fact that civilization is not something absolute, but that it is relative, and that our ideas and conceptions are true only so far as our civilization goes."" (66)</p>"
"""The Foundations of All Future Researches"": Franz Boas, George Hunt, Native American Texts, and the Construction of Modernity","p. 511 - 515 Authoritative Discourse 

So they think Boas's texts can be described as an authoritative discourse as Bakhtin defines it.  ""...practices that are used in erasing dimensions of context-sensitivity (what linguists often refer to as 'indexicality') and intertextuality in producing the illusion of boundedness, stability, and impermeability.""  (511)  

They inteligently note that Boas had deliberately drawn on the model of classical philology and pedagogy, and hoped to present Native American texts that might ""transmit"" the same authority and authenticity.  He sought to set these text up as ""artificats"" tha would require reinterpretation in the future, just like classical texts: He wrote: ""As we require a new point of view now, so future times will require new points of view and for these the texts, and sample texts, must be made available."" (quoted on 512, from  Boas to Holmes, 24 July 1905; quoted in Stocking, The Shaping of American Anthropology, 123)

Now the authors make a key argument, which is one that I disagree with: that is they connect Boas too closely to older attempts in this history of the metadiscursive practices of modernity to the likes of John Aubrey, who sough tas they write so clearly to ""promote modern epistemology and modern subjects by construing a sphere of 'Ignorance,' 'Absurdity' and 'Errours' that defined modernity negatively as contrasting maximally with the world of illiterate and superstitious 'poor people' and 'woomen.'  This opposition granted modernity an historical location and a trajectory by deeming it to e anew social and intellectual formation whose ascendancy was as certain as was the inevitable disappearance of its traditional predecessor."" (513)  Aubrey positioned himself they say as a mediator, conducting an act of salvage.  

They then move from Aubrey to Herder and the Grimms and then to Schoolcraft's attempt to draw upon Native Americans to produce a distinctly American text.  (513-514).

They want to put Boas' in this tradition.He also positioned himself as a mediator they say (515).  They pull back then saying his project was not ""identical"" to Aubrey, Herder and the Grimms.  They then try to situate it in a modernist context using DR's writing about U.S. sociologists' misxture of enthusiasm and fear of capitalism and revolution.  They seem to see Boas's salvage operation as providing a soothing balm to these people: ""A key aspect of Boas's  intervention into the social and political debates of his day lay in his
characterization of Native Americans as people who would necessarily fall victim to modernization. This perceived displacement of pre-modern peoples by civilization served as the primary warrant for Boas's research efforts. The preservation of Native American cultural knowledge through anthropological
intervention was for the benefit of 'civilization,' since the people themselves were bound to perish."" (515)  

So then this salvage operation provided a kind of recognition that these people were supposed to pass away, but that this textualized and traditionalized Other would be available for analysis.  But what the authors cannot account for is the Boasians rhetoric that these primitive others were so similar,which was also present in their analysis.

The core of their argument is this idea that Boas' believed that primitive texts could not provide an accurate analysis of events as they occured.  They repeat this and then drawn on section of the Mind of Primitive Man where he confirms the accuracy of modern knowledge (while acknowledge that it requires repression of emotion).  This difference I think they exagerate: i.e. he may have seen modern knowledge as better and different, but it was not as I have explained in Ch.2 & 3 as invulnerable to becoming inaccurate.  They even subject that Boas' modernity was ""transcendent"" (518)  which is the opposite of what I have been trying to argue.  (516-518)"

Notable points: 

-- In 1915, Abraham Flexner described social work as ""poorly paid and unprofessional."" (1053) 

-- Schools opened in New York, Boston, and Chicago between 1898 and 1908.  (1053)

-- Between 1918 and 1926, medical and psychiatric workers organized their own associations.  (1054) and Americna Associations of Social Workers formed in 1921 and had journal The Compass.  (1054)

-- So by 1930 he says it was a profession (1054); Marcy Richmond's Social Diagnosis (1917) the manual.   and in 1930 federal census gave ""social and welfare workers"" their own category (1054)

-- Between 1900 and 1930 percentage of employed women grew from 8.2 to 14.2 and ""women constituted a disproportionately large number within the professions than within the labor force in general."" (1055) And Walkowitz writes: ""Among the occupations in which women congregated such as nursing and librarianship, only 'schoolteachers' was more feminized than social work.  By 1930, four of every five people in or preparing for a career in teaching or soial work were female.  A decade earlier, fewer than three in five social workers had been female."" (1055)"
Women in Early American Anthropology,"p. 064-68 Zelia Nuttall

This section not so interesting... Haven't recorded.  But the gist is that Nuttall was a more successfull and independent scholar in her own right.  And that she practiced anthropology in a way more acceptable ot the author."
"The Age of Empire, 1875-1914","<p>Ch.5 -  Workers of the World</p>
<p>* Rise of a mass of unskilled workers.  In Germany, went from half a million in 1875 to 1.7 million in 1907, i.e. 10 to 16% of workforce.  In 1913, in Britain, 1.5 million.  Then these groups organize so that by 1914 every major industrialized nations (even the USA) had ""mass socialist parties"" (117).  IN the US, the socialist party candidate in 1912 polled a million votes.  Germany and Scandanavia had the largest, up to 35-40% of the vote.  (117).  Many contemporaries felt it was only a matter of time before these parties polled above 50%.  So one anthem of world socialism said: ""The Internationale will be the human race."" (117)  Their was reason for optimism given the rise of mass socialist parties since the 1880s...</p>
<p>* But these masses of unskilled workers were not necessarily united...and had been reerred to as the ""working classes"" (plural) before the rise of the new mass parties.  They were divided by relgion, by occupation (female cotton weavers did not necessarily have much to do with coal miners), by migration, language, nationality.  H writes: ""For what, from one point of view, looked like a concentration of men and women in a single 'working class', could be seen from another as a gigantic scattering of the fragments of societies, a diaspora of old and new communities."" (119) Description of the difficulties of unifiying this group dealt with in detail in Section II.</p>
<p>* Section III: how were these groups unified.  Ideology was key.  The unskilled workers to some extent lacked an identity.  ""Workers were unknown and forgotten people in proportion as they were a new social group."" (124)  The socialists were in many cases the first people to come to these forgotton people sand they gave them a ""single identity: that of 'the proletarian.'"" (124)  The socialists who brought this identity also brought ""organization"":  ""the structured collective action without which the working class could not exist as a class, and through organization they acquired that cadre of spokesmen who could articualte the feelings and hopes of men and women who were unable to do so themselves.  These possessed or found the words for the truths they felt.  Without this organized collectivity, they were only poor labouring folk.  For the ancient corpus of wisome -- proverbs, sayings, songs -- which formulated the <em>Weltanschauung</em> of the labouring poor of the pre-industrial world was no longer enough.  They were a <em>new </em>social reality, requiring new reflection."" (125)</p>
<p>* The ideology teaching the injustice of the social order was one thing but ""the crux of their experience was their relation with their employers.  The new socialist labour movement was inseparable from the discontents of the workplace..."" (126)</p>
<p>* The working class was also increasingly separated from ""those above"" by the ""tertiary sector"" -- ie lower middle classes who stressed the differences they had with the working classes and what they hoped they shared with their ""social superiors."" (127)</p>
<p>* What also helped to unify the working classes was the development of the capitalist system and the growth of industrial sectors that led workers to move beyond concerns for their own partiuclar coal mine or pit and link their fate with workers in a whole industiral sector.  ""Fiercely attached though British coal-miners were to the autonomy of their coalfield or even their pit, conscious of the specificity of their problems and customs, South Wales and Northumberland, Fife and Staffordshire, they found themselves for this reason inevitably drawn together between 1888 and 1908 into national organization."" (128)</p>
<p>* The state also helped.  ""...electoral democratization imposed the class unity its rulers hoped to avoid.  The fight for the extension of citizen rights itself inevitably took on a class tinge for workers, since the central question at issue (at least for men) was the right to vote of the <em>propertyless </em>citizen."" (128)  Many, esp. anarchists were bothered by this because it took attention away from revolution.  But mainly this force was unavoidable b/c increasingly as the state took shape every group had to pursue its poitical aims by ""exerting pressure on the <em>national</em> government, in favour of or against the legislation and adminisitration of <em>national</em> laws."" (129) And the working class had a particular need to use national law to repair aspects of the system that would strengthen their a capacity for collective action.""  (129)  As a consequence, then, the ""force of working-class unification withing each nation inevitably replaced the hopes and theoretical assertions of working-class internationalism, except for a noble-minority of militants and activists."" (129)</p>
<p>* Section IV deals more with the cultural side of class ""consciousness"", including the role of Marx's teachings.  INterestingly, he notes that the leaders of these mass movements ""took it for granted that they wanted a social revolution, or that their activities implied one."" (132) This drew upon Mark in some cases, but also to 1789 and 1776.  Some, on the right, like Eduard Bernstein recommendd focusing on immediate eneds and argued that Marx's theories should be revised in light of the success of capitalism.  (133) But in many cases in Germany for example, Marx's theories were not particularly influenctial in the work ing classes.  Rather the leaders were smitten with a kind of scientific ethos as against the threat of ""ignorance and supersittion.""  So the German SDP which had declared itself Marxist in 1891, only printed editions of the <em>Communist Manifesto</em> in editions of 2000-3000 copies, whereas the most popular title was <em>Darwin versus Moses</em>.  (135)  Most Marxist leaders were imported from points farther east, from the Hapsburg Empire.  E.g. Kautsky and Hilferding, and Rosa Luxemburg.  (135)</p>
<p>* H insists that what motivated socailists, hwoever, was not revolution but the possibility of the ""significant amelioration"" that came from their action and unification.  E.g. in places in Italy where mass socialist parties were strong, there was far less migration.  (135-136)</p>
<p>* Another problem facing the labour movement was the fact that the working calss was not the majority fo the population, so they had to figure out how to appeal more broadly.  But this also threatened the revolutionary aspirations as Marx had described them.  Agrarian populations, for example, were in theory supposed to dissapear.  But these parties did appeal beyond the ""proletariat"".  A ig part of it was the link between socalism and the idea of Progress (138-139).  And where parties appealed outside the proletariat it did tend to turn them into ""parties of government"" rather than revolutionary parties, andthis happened particulary after 1918.</p>
<p>* At the end of the chapter, H makes an important point that you can't really write the history fo the urban poor in terms of ""class consciousness"".  He describes an apolitical poor.  A great many of the poor he says did not think of themselves as proletarian; ""They saw themselves as belonging to the eternal category of the poor, the outcast, the unlucky or the marginal.  If they were migrants into the big city fromt he countryside or some foreign region, they might live in a ghetto whcih could overlap wth the working-class slum, but was more likely to be dominated by the street, the market, the innumberable petty ways, legal or non-legal, in which poor families kept body and soul together, only some of which were in any real sense of wage-work.  What counted for them was not union or class-party, but neighbours, family, patrons who could o favours or provide jobs, otherwise avoiding rather than pressuring public authorities, priests, poeple from the sampe place in the old country, anybody and anything that made life in a new and unknown environment possible....The ironic, shoulder-shrugging, accepting, utterly a-political world of English music-hall song, whic had its golden age in these years, is closer to that of the conscious working clss, but its themes--mothers-in-law, wives, no money for the rent--belonged to any community of nineteenth-century urban underdogs."" (140) BUT he notes ""the culture of th eplebian pooor, even the world of traditional outcasts, shded over into that of class consciousness where both existed.""  So he notes that in Berlin or in Hamburg ""even the pimps, thieves and fences wouldpay their respect to it.""  (140)</p>"

Women in Early American Anthropology,"p. 035  Demogrpahics of Anthropological Society

She notes that membership in the Anthropological Society of Washington was exclusively  male, but thinks this was ""not so much conscious as automatic, and reflected the usual organization of groups in the national center."" (35) It had been founded in 1879 and a notice had been put in a local newspaper announcing a meeting open to interested persons.  She notes that ""records show, no women put in an appearance, nor, in the next few years did it seem to have occured to women to request membership in the group."""
American Moderns: Bohemian New York and the Creation of a New Century,"p. 304 - 308 Bohemian Mysogyny  or Antifeminism or...

In this section, S describes via Hapgood (and Boyce) the way men developed a new form of dominance even in the explicitly feminist (or explicitly not antifeminist) bohemianism of their day.  She refers to Hapgood's story of his relationship with Boyce: Story of a Lover (1919).  She describes it this way: ""The book is extraordinary in many ways, not least in the feat of describing in detail the actions of a depressed woman without ever acknowledging she is depressed."" (305) But more importantly she sees the book as revealing a new form of criticism of women within the bohemian idiom, ""what would become a vigorous, long-lasting tradition of male complaint founded on psychological wounds rather than political objections."" (305)

But it's more than that still.  It's also after more dominance in the same-old way: ""Like John Reed's stories, Hapgood's book questions the credibility of the female voice.  His heroine is so remote that she barely speaks, and when she does speak it is better if she hadn't: 'Because it was [page] unnatural for her to express herself in sound, when she did so, the sounds, if those of exasperated discomfort, were peculiarly irritating.'"" (306)  S notes Hapgood tires to portray Boyce as an ""inarticulate object"" (306)  

Stansell situates the future of this sex-talk within the general narrative of the declension of feminism in the 20s, the commercialization of sexual liberalism in the flapper and youth culture... (307)  But she notes that the discourse on sex was problematic from its 1910s origins, a new construction of the New Woman in a way that suggested power but in reality didn't deliver: ""Bohemian sex talk can be seen as an early contribution to the annals of 'men talk, women listen,' a chronicle that has played a large part in our understanding and experience of sexual modernism.  The fusion of modernity with emancipated femininity simplified both, assigning the New Woman an overweening symbolic role that promised power but in reality imprisoned.  The sexually free woman became a frame for propositions about the modern and the feminine that reduced both to a matter of their effect on male authority.  It was left for women to display their spiritual and erotic riches and others--men--to speak for them."" (307) 

Of this New Woman Stansell writes: ""The positive outlook and putative towering self-confidence of the free-loving woman became a seductive model of action, will, and sexual agency, but these ascribed powers left women little room to address their actual needs and difficulties.  It was rare for women to give back as good as they got when they talked about sex."" (307)

The Present Dilemma in Philosophy,"<p>General Notes:</p>
<p>* <strong>Philosophy is a matter of a ""clash of human temperaments"". (488)</strong>&nbsp; ""Of whatever temperament a professional philsopher is, he tries, when philosophizing to sink the fact of temperament....Yet his temperament really gives him a stronger bias than any of his more strictly objective premises.&nbsp; It loads evidence for him one way or the other, making for a more sentimental or a more hard-hearted view of the universe, just as this fact or that principle would.&nbsp; He <em>trusts</em> his temperament.&nbsp; Wanting a universe that suits it, he believes in any representation of the universe that does suit it."" (488-489)</p>
<p>* He says that this is true of philosophers, but most people ""most of us"" he says, have ""no very definite intellectual temperament, we are a mixture of opposite ingredients, each one present very moderately...."" (489)&nbsp; People are influenced by their local philospher he says...</p>
<p>*&nbsp; No he wants to trace the different temperaments that are significant for talking of philosophy.&nbsp; He says temperament affects all areas of social and cutlrual life. It's their in art, literature, government etc.&nbsp; In philosphy the key temperamental distinctions are between the ""rationalist"" and the ""empiricist"".&nbsp; He says rationalist are also referred to as intellectualists and empriicists as sensationalists.&nbsp; He characterizes these temperaments on 490-492. The classification is the tought v. the tender minded.&nbsp;</p>
<p>* He notes that most of us who aren't philosophers, because we mix things, mix these temperamental inclinations too.&nbsp; He shows some of the mixtgures on 491-492.&nbsp;</p>
<p>* But then eh says this mixing is also somehow true for philsophers of one or the other inclination.&nbsp; Ie empriciists he says have still a kind of religious. temper.&nbsp; (492-493).&nbsp; And ratioanlist-idealists + common-sense realists.&nbsp; These are the options on th tender-midned side.&nbsp; The critique here is that these systems that they construct lose contact with the world.&nbsp; He makes this point through a critique of Leibniz on 495-99.&nbsp; The wrold in all its complexit is boxed out.&nbsp;&nbsp; He ends this critique with a critqiue bya an anarchist (499-500).&nbsp; That critique ends with a reference to teh ""mental world"" as a physical thing of ""atoms"" and ""sub-atoms"" as the ""consumate factor of all conscious experience"", as apart from the absolute idealists' understanding of ""Reality"" as a what White calls a ""absolute phase of the universe"" unconnected to the concrete world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Then James begins to name his own ""solution"" ie ""the oddly-named thing pragmatism"" which he sees as a ""philospphy that can satisfy&nbsp; both kinds of demand.&nbsp; It can remain religious like the rationalism but at the same time, like the empiricisms, it can preserve the richest intimacy with facts."" (500-501)</p>
<p>* He says he won't go into this now, leaving it to the next lecture: What is Pragmatism?&nbsp; But he ends by going over his idea that one should pay heed to temperament.&nbsp; (501-503)&nbsp; Key parts it seems to me are when he says that on 502-3 that everyonhe as ""his own peculiar sense of a certain total character in the universe, and of the inadequacy fully to match it of the peculiar systems that he knows."" (503) H ereers taen to Plato, Locke, Spinoza, Mill, Caird, Hegel--each of them he says his hearers think of as ""little more than reminders of as many curious personal ways of falling short."" (503)&nbsp; then he saqys ""It would be an obvious abusridty if such ways of taking the universe were actually true."" (503) -- this last bit, in what sense would this be absurd?&nbsp; I think because they are closed systems--ie not admitting of the fundamental openness as he refered to it earlier of the concrete/factual world... To this point he ends by attacking the Spencer's take as an ""abstract outline""&nbsp; and then asking why nonetheless does ""half of England"" want to ""bury him in Westminster Abbey."" (503)</p>

By end of the 1890s thouhg he uses it in a pluralzied 		form, though still within a conception of stages of development so ""civilizatoin"" is the highest cultural achievment.

The Clash of Civilizations?,"p.039  The Western Civilization he thinks is at the height of its power.

He says war is unthinkable between Western powers.  There is no other super-power outside of the West.  Indeed, its power is evident in its attempt to represent its interests as being identical with the world: ""Decisions made at the U.N. Security Council or in the International Monetary Fund that reflect the interests of the West are presented to the world as reflecting the desires of the world community.  The very phrase 'the world community' has become the euphemistic collective noun (replacing 'the Free World') to give global legitimacy to actions reflecting the interests of the United States and other Western powers."" (39)  He notes in f.n.# 4 on p.39 that P.M. John Major ""referred to the actions 'the West' was taking against Saddam Hussein.  He quickly corrected himself and subsequently referred to 'the world community.' He was, however, right when he erred."" (39)

He argues that these ""international organizations"" support Western interests: ""The West in effect is using international institutions, military power and economic resources to run the world in way that will maintain Western predominance, protect Western interests and promote Western political and economic values."" (40)

This dominance, though exercised in military and economic power is ultimately in defense, Huntington says, of culture: ""Differences in culture, that is basic values and beliefs, are a second source of conflict."" (40)  He argues that while the West has perceived its culture as ""universal"" in fact ""Western ideas of individualism, liberalism, constitutionalism, human rights, equality, liberty, the rule of law, democracy, free markets, the separation of church and state, often have little resonance in Islamci, Confucian, Japanese, Hindu, Buddhist or Orthodox cultures."" (40) -- indeed, the idea of  a univeral society, he notes, is also Western (41).

He insists that Asian societies are more particularist (41)

He suggest than that the central conflict of the futre will be in the phrase of Kishore Mahbubani: ""the West and the Rest"" (that phrase comes from Mahbubani's ""The West and the Rest"" in The Naitonal Intersts, Summer 1992, p3 -13.

three options exist for the ""rest"": isolation (like N. Korea and Burma); ""band-wagoning"" that is joining the West, accepting ""its values and institutions."" (41); and balancing the West ""by developing economic and military power and cooperating with other non-Western societies against the West, while preserving indigenous values and institutions; in short, to modernize but not to Westernize.""

<p>There's economic and financial panic in 1837, contraction of cash and credit.  This leads to renewed claims for the redistribution ofwealth, for instance by Orestes Brownson, but also to a Romantic critique of classical political economy's ""proprietary"" understanding of the autonomous self.  Sklansky is explicit that the American romantics' complaints were ""less with capitalism itself than with the political economy that naturalized and rationalized it--the 'dismal science,' in Carlyl'es enduring epithet, of 'economic man.'"" (36) That critique, born out of Romantic's elevation of Intuition above Reason, produced a ""fundamentally diferent kind of critique, one that essentially dispensed with ownership and the political rights that accompanied it.""

The Subject of Liberty: Toward a Feminist Theory of Freedom,"p.28-30  Individualism keeps Pettit from seeing; Feminist framework for understanding patriarchy requires rejection of Individualism


complex relationship between domination and interference...  this:

""Social norms do not come into being by themselves and they cannot persist without people's actively calling on and deploying them.  So the domination that might resutl from such norms cannot persist without individuals' acting with larger frameworks of cultural meaning to interfere with other individuals' self-conceptions, desires, and choices.  But that the same time, the power of norms, practices, an dmeanings far exceeds the grasp and control of any individual, so that his power can be used and called into play without the explicit awareness of anyone, either dominus or dominated."" (28)

She thinks Petitt cannot see this b/c of his commitment to ""the individualist conception of freedom, wherein interference always requires an agent  who acts intentionally and purposefully."" (28)

She points out that Pettit: ""maintains that we can have domination without interference.  That is, the only way for him to claim that freedom can be restricted without intention and purpose of being exercised--a claim which I obviously support--and yet retain individualism is to reject 'non-interference' as the defining feature of freedom.""  (28)

This, she says, does not resolve the basic question which is what would freedom look like to a feminist... b/c Pettit's theory cannot answer where the forces of domination which don't require interference originated from... 

To answer that question H thinks, to provide a framewokr that can explain ""how it is that social forces like patriarchy are able to restrict women's freedom"" (29)  She think you must reject ""individualism as a guiding principle."" (29)"
Adam Smith and the Circles of Sympathy: Cosmopolitanism and Moral Theory,"<p>Notes Feb 2012:</p>
<p>(For Cosmpotitanism article...)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>* FB believes sees Adam Smith as an anti-cosmpolitan, but she believes that the way in which Smith struggled with the problem of spatial distance in his moral philosophy ""provides a framework for thinking in fresh ways about new sorts of human connection that emerge in a global age, for reflecting on what William Connolly has recently called 'eccentric' connections that emerge in an age of speed and compressed distance--'crosscutting allegiances' that 'exceed,' 'complicate,' and often 'compromise' the concentric connections of place that governed in ages when people lived slow, local lives."" (5-6) So what she is doing here is saying that Smith's thought</p>
<p>* Smith is an anti-cosmpolitan FB says because he rejected the Stoic idea of <em>oikeiosis.&nbsp; Oikos</em> refers to the private realm of the home as opposed to the public or <em>polis</em>.&nbsp; ""<em>Oikeiosis</em> was a Stoic extrapolation from the familiarity that develops over time among those who inhabit the <em>oikos</em>, among those who very literally share physical space.&nbsp; Most fully developed byy Cicero and Hierocles, <em>oikeiosis</em> was the notion that human affection weakens as it radiates outward in degrees from the self.&nbsp; Thus, the Stoics mapped our affections concentrcially, arguing that our affecions are strongest at the center, closest and most familiar to the self, and that thez weaken progressively as an object is removed further and further away."" (8)&nbsp; Ie for the Stoics ""human affection and care are ordered spatially around the self in a concentric pattern."" (8)&nbsp; Smith appropriated this idea in that he saw it as an ""empirical fact"", FB says, but he was ambivalent about it <strong>and rejected the Stoics insistence that the individual should ""cultivate 'apathy' toward the near and dear</strong>, learn to resist <em>oikeiosis</em> (the natural affection born of familiarity), to collapse the circles, and become 'citizens of the world.'"" (8) &nbsp;</p>
<p>* Smith's ambivalent appropriation of <em>oikeiosis</em> produced in his moral philosophy a certain take on the interelationship between ethics and spatial distance that FB thinks speaks directly to contemporaray debates about cosmopolitanism, and especially the ""concentric model of ethical concern"" that comes from Stoic thought but which is also ""commonplace in ethics discourse today"" (9)-- she&nbsp; highliights in particular Martha Nussbaum as someone who has drawn this model from the Stoics in her work on cosmpolitnaism (see 10-11).&nbsp;</p>
<p>* The reason she suggests that Smith is useful for a discussion of contemporary cosmpolitanism is precisely because he engaged this model, even though he rejected the Stoic's cosmpolitan vision.&nbsp; His rejections of that model in fact may help us understand and work through our own engagement with the term, which as she points out at the beginning of her introduction (pp.1-3) very much seeks to figure out ways to cope with the way in which the local limits the universalist ethical thrust of cosmpolitan desires.&nbsp; Here is how she puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The arguments he mounted against the Stoic project add a fresh, distinctively Scottish sociological and moral psychological texture and depth to the steady onslaught of localist, communitarian, and culturalist challenges leveled against the cosmpoitan project today.&nbsp; Like us, Smith struggled with surmounting spatial obstacles to human understanding and care, bringing his ethical thought front and center, and transforming Smith from a stodgy Scot long rebuffed by political theorists and moral philosophers for his vexing defense of free market capitalism in the <em>Wealth of Nations</em> and into a worthy interlocutor in the cosmpolitan debates who richly appreciated the local texture of human identity and can help us, in this sense, to grasp some of the limits of our own aspirations.

The Rise of Neo-kantianism: German Academic Philosophy between Idealism and Positivism,"<p>Notes Part II (5/2013)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>## Part II: Philosophy in the post-March period and the neo-Kantian programmata (1849-1865) <br /><br />### 3. Philosophical trends of the post-March period and the programmata of the 'Sceptical Gernation'<br /><br />* K&amp;ouml;hnke argues that the 1848 revolution and the general politicization contributed to a key development in late ninteenth century philosophy in Germany. The system building impulse of German idealism had already come unders doubt in the 1840s. Because, in part, the idea that oen could deduce a system from principle had come under dobut, but also becasue there were mutliple and contradictory systems, and these systems also made strong political claims about culture and history. So when in the 1840s there emerged a new political polarization this had a big impact, because philosophical systems were linked up with ideological parties. (69-70) You&nbsp; had on the one hand the materialism and ""panthesism"" of the Left Hegelians and the ""aristocratic realism"" of the Herbartians and idealistic ""theosophic speculation"" of Schelling and Stahl on the other. (70-71)<br /><br />* Following the failued revolution in 1848, however, thign developed further in away that ultimately led a sharp separation of practical from theoretical philsophy.&nbsp; Before the revolution already most philosohpers recognized a need for a non-speculative philosophy, but ""it required the failure of a revolution wholly to banish questions of practical politics -- and with them the entire political philosphy of the opposition -- fromt he life of the university: it was beacsue Germany had not become even a constitutional monarchy, let alone a republic, that the German university could likewise not become a republic of science..."" (71) Instead, K notes, the ultra-conservative tendencies ie specualtive philsophy and the modern ""spitemologically oriented philsophers"" remained in the unviersity,while all those tendnecies in which philosophy engaged the public remained outside. (71)<br /><br />* K then traces two key developments here. One, the framing of Schopenhauer by Julius Frauenst&amp;auml;dt in a 1849 article ""Opinons on Arthur Schopenhauer"" that produced what K describes as this important alternative view of philosohpy: that emphasized the philosopher as opposed to the system; the individualism of the philosopher; the literary prowess of the philospher and their ""free-thinking qualities"" -- and all this long before the ""Nietzsche cult."" (71-74) On the flip side, he describes Johann Eduward Erdmann's use of Herbart as an empiricist who nontheless traeted the individual and ""the given"" as the reality -- that is a kind of conservative empricisism. (74-77) These two positions formed an antithesis, but K wants to empahsize the key point is also that both Schopenhauer and Herbart constituted a new synthesis that inspired a ""reinvigorated reference back to Kant: Schopenhauer predominantly to the idalist, Herbart predominantly to the realist elements of the Kantian philosophy."" (77) <br /><br />* Then also cleverly K notes the development of an external and internal constraint in academic philosphy. There was on the one hand a sense of the alienation of academic philosophy from the public, e.g. in the foreward composed by IH Fichte, H Ulrice, JU Wirth for the revived *Zeitschrift f<br />&amp;uuml;r Philosophie und philosophische Kritik in 1852, see great quote on 77-78.&nbsp; The response to their sense of aileantion was to advocate a pure science that would not address ""interest"" or what K calls *Weltanschauung*. (78) So K dates what he calls the ""epoch of modern philosophy -- and that means the eopoch in whcih it beacme within the university a mere 'branch of learning,' a learned discipline beside others, and itself abandoned all claim to be in any respecting anything more..."" (79) to March 1852.&nbsp; This was the ""internal constraint."" But there was also an external cosntraint -- namely, that the rise of such a purely secular philosohy was still regarded by the universities in some cases as hostile -- ie they could not believe that this new pure science was not an attack on the church. So he describes how both Carl Prantl and Kuno Fischer were excluded from the universities for attempting such secular philosophical projects. (79-83) <br /><br />* These external and internal constraints together make acaemic philosophy largely irrelevant culturally. (83) Students only took note of philosophy only through history of philosophy and its involvement with aprticualr individual sceinces. (83-84) At this point, though, the philosophy that sought closer assocation with 'other' sciences did so more as an end in itself, and less in the way that Trendelendburg for exmaple had meant that engaement in the pre-March period. (83-84)<br /><br />* He rolls out Kiel professor Friedrich Harms (1816-1880) as an example of someone who provided the ""first prospectus for a purely scientifici philosphy of this kind."" (84) What he notes is particualrly interesting is that Harms' text has the ""twofold assualt on materialism and German idealism that was to be typical of the later neo-Kantian progrmamata."" (84) He quotes on 84-85. The thrust here is that philosophy must seek ""fundamental principles and a method of knowledge"" unerlying the indviidual sceinces by examining ""the nature of th emind itself."" (Harm's words, 84). ""It [philosophy] has to explain and offer grounds for the definition, the conept of science whose validity is presupposed in every particualr science. This task it alloted to it by the nature our mind, whcih strives to attain insight into its own essnetial character, and by the essential character of the particular sciences, which demand for their elucidation a primary anda&nbsp; basic science."" (quoted 84-85). --&gt; K says Harms was talking about not ""enroaching upon the mterial domains of other practical sciences"" as had natural philosphy (materialism) and philosophy of history (idealism), but a ""critical theory of the science of hsitory which made it its task to secure the foudnations of this science."" (85) <br /><br />* The reason there is interest in this kind of science is , K notes, because the conflit over mateiralism had made it clear that the ""methods and reults of the individual sciences proved to be politically and *weltanschaulich* highly contensious."" (86) He sees this in a 30 March 1854 article by Andrewas Ludwig Kym, six months before&nbsp; the dispute over materalism began. (86) The article ""The *Weltanschauungen* and their Consequences""&nbsp; argues that the individual sciecnes each create theri own *Weltanschauungen*. ""Each attempt...by human thought to pentrrate the given world represents the origination of a science. The different soceities are the diferetn ways in which human thought strives to comprehend the soure of all life and all spirit. Thus there are as many possible *Weltanschauungen* as there are sceicnes."" (quoted on 86) From here Kym, says there is a need for a ""universal science"" that can reveal what is in common. That is philosophy. So K writes that it was not only the attempt to found philosophy anew on the basis of indivdual sceneces that lead to an itnerest in epsitemology and methodology, but also ""the 'one-sidededness' of the *Weltanschauungen* that proceed from the various sciences to promote an interest in this domain. It is because the siecnes now acquire the *function of founding Weltanschauungen* that there now appears the need for a supreme court of control t adjucucate border dispute which --long before neo-Kantianism -- philosophy feels itself called upon to be."" (87) &nbsp;<br /><br />* Key and interesting here I think,though, is that ultimately Kym rejects the idea that there are infinite Weltanschauungen for the idea that there are only two: naturwissenschaft and geisteswissenschaft. &nbsp;<br /><br />NOTE: This is what Boas does too. <br /><br />* K says that although Kym did not realize it what he was doing was providing an early critique of postiviism or the ""view that the individuals sciences can furnish the knoweldge that is to replace philosophical knowledge."" (87) <br /><br />* This goes to a historigoraphic piont that K is very exercised in making -- because it apparently corrects an oft-repated error -- that Mill's Logik der Geisteswissenschaften appeared in 1849 and initiated a German concern with the relationship between philosophy and science, when in fact his point is that that interest existed long before. So there was in fact little interest in Comtean postiivism or Mill because the profession was already fighting in the 1850s against ""Fuerbach and the anthropologism he origianted&nbsp; which through a universal naturalization of aoll spiritual phenomena threatened to replace philosophy with inquire confiend to natural science (prantl, Harms); against empriidcal natural-sceientific pscyhology (Drobish, Waitz) and the materialism which was an even crasser manifestation of it... and, finally, against the imporation of foreign positivist or inductive logics such as those of Herschel, Comte, Mill, Opzoomer, whcih were likewise incompatibile with any traditional conception of philosphy's tasks or themes."" (89) <br /><br />* K's bigger point here seems to be that the difficulty opositivism had in catching on in Germany had to do with the sharp ""antithesis"" between the independent sciences and the still idealist pretnesions of academic philosoophy. ""Here materialist and naturalist tendencies were, like positivism, and not only in the 1850s, graded as 'dangerous' on account of their propsensity to undermine all morality and idealism in just the same way as was the secular conception of philosphy as 'pantheism'."" And this he thinks -- giong back to the thesis that began this chapter -- was one of the ""consequences of the political and ecclesiasticcal repression"" in Germany as opposed to in France or England... that made it hard to respond to the rise of natural sciences and of technology and industry in by a ""philosophical theorizing in this sense 'appropriate to the age.'"" (90) <br /><br />* So now in a section on the ""Skeptical Generation"" of the 1850s. (90-96) He lays out what he sees as a social history argument to explain why the neo-Kantian pioneers of the new criticism emerged. He lists them as Hermann Helholtz (1821), Ruduolf Hayan&nbsp; (1821), Kuno Fischer (1824), Friedrich Ueberweg (1826) and Juergen Bona Meyer (1829). (94) they were born in the 1820s. They faced a situation marked first by 1848 and the failued revolution that created a ""prohibition of all free *Weltanschaulich* philosophical discussion"" (95) and then by the 1854 reaction to materialism that created a situation in which one iether had to move back toward a Christian Weltanschauung or opt for a mechanistic picture of the world.&nbsp; Plus -- moreover -- the context of repression of secular philosophy (the external constraint) created a situation in which choosing philosophy required economic hardship. These men did not receive their professorship until in their 40s. They on average married at 33. They experienced the ""*weltanschaunlich* polarization"" at ages between 26 and 35. So their bvasic position K says was of ""seeking a philosophical justification for an attitude of 'neither-nor' or one of 'this as well as that.'"" (96) (94-96)&nbsp; This leads to a situation in which they combined mechanistic views with idealist ones. He says Lange was like this; and that Helmholtz and Meyer advocated a critical standpoint based in neither-nor to the end that ""in theoretical philosphy their argumetns were predominantly materialist but in practical philosphiy predominatly idealist."" (96) Bloch called this ""dobule-entry book-keeping under sicence and idealism"" (quoted on 96). <br /><br />* Now getting into the earliest neo-Kantians in a fourth section in this chapter. The movement saw Helmholtz as key as Also Riehl sad of him that he restored a collaboration between science and philosophy. That is, K says, that in this equation ""Kantianism and a connection with the individual sciences were henceforeth equated with one another."" (96) Helhomltz was key because being a natural scientist and physician he ""seemed to have learned in the school of *nature* rather than in that of *philosophy*."" (97) This was not true, however, K notes, because Helmholtz had really been schooled in the line of philosophy etending back to von Berger, and through IH. Fichte to his father that K has been tracing. (97-98) <br /><br />* Key here was a refuation of materialism that used a recognition of the physiolgoical basis of senses -- and what they conttributed to external objects -- as a way to refute materialism. F.A. Lange put it in his *History of Materialism* this way:<br />&gt; There is a domain of exact natural science which prevents our contemporary materialists from angrily turning their backs on all doubts as to the reality of the phenomenal world: it is the physiology of the sense-organs...Once it has been demonstrated that the quality of our sense-perceptions is wholly determined by the nature of our organs we can no longer dismiss with the predicate 'irrefutable or absurd' the postulate that the entire connected cohesion to which we reduce these sense-perceptions, in short our whole experience, is determined by a spiritual oranization which compels us to experience as we experience, to think as we think... (quoted on 97)<br /><br />&nbsp; That motif of refutation of materialism already existed in Helmholtz, K says. Kant and Fichte, whom Helmholtz linked together, represneted a ""principle of an idealist epistemology"". (98) Helmholtz achieved the same thing by fusing Johannes M&amp;uuml;ller's thoery of specific energies of the senses -- the idea that the quality of our sensations came from energy transmitted to objects by our sense-organs -- with Kan'ts theory of pure forms of perception. So that he argued that the ""character of our perceptions is conditinoed as much by the nature of our senses as it is by external objects..."" and that this idea confirmed by natural science demosntates ""by empirical means...the same thing that Kant, by setting forth the part played in the formation of our ideas by the particular innate laws of the mind, as it were the organization of the mind, earlier sought to demosntrate with regarde to the idea of the human mind in general."" (quoted on 98) <br /><br />* From here, more importantly, Helmholtz then speculated on the relationship of the will to senses. He said that the idea of causation in the wrold is an a priori upon which our abiltiyt o have knowledge of the world depends precisely because we cannot derive it from self-reflection, and we cannot do that precisely because ""we regard the self-aware acts of our thought and will as free, i.e. we deny that they are the necessary effects of sufficient causes."" (Helmtholtz, quoted on 99) Here then you have the preservation of the separation of practical and theoretical knowledge in separate registers. Likewise, when his fatehr tried to confront him over the issue of materialism, he remained skeptical abut the enlarged claims of materalists in the realm of *Weltanschuungen*. <br /><br />* From Helmholtz ""purely empirical"" neo-Kantianism, K moves on to two other versions (the three beign laid out repsectively in 1855, 1856, and 1857). The other two are J&amp;uuml;rgen Meyer's criticalist neo-Kantiaism, and Haym's liberalist neo-Kantianism. (see 105). <br /><br />* Meyer's criticalism has a more uncomplicated critique of materialism -- which is a bit harder to see, though also true of, in Helmholtz. This is not yet FA Lange's criticalism because philosophy does not yet ""stand above"" K says. (101).&nbsp; Meyer also studied medicine and natural sciences, at Bonn, and then in 1853 began to study philosophy. (101) He gets into a convention over body and soul, where hedefends against the idea that materialism necessarily means a rejection of free will and consciousness. (101)&nbsp; In what K calls the first neo-Kantian book *Zum Streit &amp;uuml;ber Leib und Seele* he lays out a ""criticalism"" that basically is rooted in an awareness of ""the boundaries of our knowledge"" and yet a desire within that awareness to strive ""with unidivided strength for what is possible within these limits."" (quoted on 102, see whole long quote). K emphasiszes it is an ateempt to ""segregate philosophical, epistemological and scientific-theoretical preoblems from very political and *weltanschaulich contention."" (102)</p>

There was a growing emphasis on the need for a form of inquiry that would ""resolve the subject-object probem in such a way that neither the share o the subjective nor that of the objective&nbsp; would be made one-sidedly, and thus uncritically, absolute."" (113) Even though the back to Kant movement had not yet obviously begun then here Kant was already referred to because he was a good starting point for the kind of epistemology that such a philosophy would require. See quote by Eduard Zeller on 113.The drive Koehnke says wa toward ""the conversion of an absolute opposition [between idealism and materialism] into a relative one, of a confrontation into a synthesis."" (114) Kant was taken by Zeller, quote on 113 and 114, as someone who denied the absolute truth of either perspective buth thought both had something important.(113-114)</span></p>

See Juergen Bona Meyer reflections on this on 116-117. Fischer it seems was reading Kant as a kind of ""empirical idealist"" -- i.e. attributing to Kant's categories a kind of objective validity, i.e. such that what is external to us i.e. space pertains to ""things-in-themselves"" -- only it our knowledge of those things-in-themselves is in question.

It first took place around discussions of the 'body-soul problem"" that had been discussed since 1854 in many brochures and small monogrphas many of which took aim at materialism. (118) And also around the celbration of Schiller (Kant's pupil) as a kind of national hero, celebrations that coincided with the entry of Prussia and the German Confederation into the Franco-Austrian war. (118) Following on these Schiller celebrations then also there were more references to Kant, and an attitude toward him developed that treated him as a contemporary, i.e. not dealing with irrelevant problems. As Karl Fortlage put it in the *Litearische Centralbaltt* in 1860: ""Kant is not old, Kant is younger than any of us."" (See whole quote on 119). But this enthusiasm was of ac ertain line of interpreation that linked Schiller-Fichte and Kant, i.e. a kind of idealist version of Kant. Thus Fortlage continued his recognition of this Kant revival with a review of Kuno Fischer's presentation of Kant. (119)</span></p>

K describes his owrk as a ""one-sidedly idealist explication of Kant"" (125). He goes into this in great detail, but a good sense of what K thinks Fischer was diong comes on 133, when he notes after a quote in which Fischer writes that ""Space and time are always there..."" that whereas Kant had wanted to submit the ""'ideas' we commonly construct for ourselves of knowledge, the worl,d the soul and God to a critique of theroetical and practical reason,"" Fischer has essentially reversed this impulse. He wanted to in his ""criticalism"" do the opposite...to set oup a ""system of critical philosphy"" and a ""system of pure reason."" Or what K calls a ""positive sysetm of pure reason"". And hewas able to do this just because hw as so convinced of his own pure reason K says, bottom 133. </span></p>

Well this certain that Fischer felt and his neo-idealism seemed to give philosophy a certain autonomy in relation to the other science, ""and this autonomy rested quite direclty on a demonstration rof the a prior, of the presuppositionality of the 'pure' forms of perception that enter into all processes of cognition.""

(135) This cocktail was a powerful force pushing back agains the materialistc threat. and it's succes pushed aside for some time the ""realist elements of Kantian philosophy"" focusin insetad on the ""subjective and formal elements in the process of congition.""

"Creating a Female Dominion in American Reform, 1890-1935","p.051-52 Gender based patronage (not political)

Muncy describes a patronage system inside the bureau based on gender and professional cutlure.  Men were therefore maginalized and did not hold decision making positions in the bureau.  (52) Similar culture in the Bureau as in the settlement houses: ""...Some women formed close personal as well as professoinal relationships.  Sometimes they lived or at least dined together.  Most workers loived in boarding houses or apartment hotels.  Hotels provided individual kitchens but also supplied meals in a common dining room.  Women who lived in either a boarding house or a hotel thus enjoyed many of the advantages offered by settlements: private rooms, freedom from cooking, and communal dining arrangement..."" (52)  More details 52-53: including intimacy among staff, and the responsiveness of the Bureau to the letters and pleas for help that were received."

And he then also met Fichte and Schiller in Jena when he moved<br />there in 1794. (21)<br /><br />* Herder's holism described. (20).

The character of a Volk<br />revealed in turn the level of Bildung.<br />This plan was an attempt, Bumz<br />Points out, to fuse Herder and Kant. (22)<br /><br />* By 1822, the year H presented his Historiographical treatise, Bunzl<br />says Romantic nationalism had taken over. (25) Humboldt was also<br />affected by this shift and the ""anti-rationalism"" as Bunzl calls it<br />that came with it. Bunzl describes this balance here on 25-26.<br />Humboldt here accepts that there are mechanistic and physiological<br />factors that affect history in a regular and lawful manner, but these<br />were not the real forces in history. The real forces were non<br />rational, and these were those related to ""abilities, feelings,<br />dispositions and desires"". -- the charachter of a people-- and these<br />needed to be studied under<br /><br />* 1808 Humboldt becomes secretary of education, and in 1809 founds the<br />University of Berlin. 1810 he enters politics as a envoy to Vienna but<br />is removed in 1819 for his liberal politics.

(24)he influenced German historical writing with his<br />Über die Aufgabe des Geschichtsschreibers"" and also influenced<br />Voelkerpsychologie.

(28) But Bunzl points put also that<br />the ultimate goal for Lazarus and Steinthal was to find ""the laws that<br />governed the psychological development of a people."" (28) in their<br />conception, the essence of mankind was divided in to Voelker, so the<br />laws of all people's psychology would have to slowly emerge. (28)<br /><br />* This sounds a lot like the Bastian and the kind of position I am<br />saying that boas pivoted against. (28)<br /><br />* Humboldts linguistic work began after his forced retirement in 1819.<br />(29) key text, much respected, is H's pisthumously published intro to<br />the Kawa-Werk... (29)<br /><br />* Key to his method, a break with the use of European grammatical<br />categories to analyze other languages. Instead, H analyzed languages<br />according to their distinct structural features, foreshadowing<br />structural linguistics. (31)<br /><br />* Only after describing the inner structure of these languages did he<br />move on to the analysis of these languages genetic relationship. (32)<br />here he dealt with inter influence and mixing. (32) but Bunzl makes<br />clear that H really understood this mixing only as a force that had in<br />fact helped to create he individual languages in the first place. Thus<br />really there was no way to get At the grenealogival relationships. So here Humboldt really shies away<br />from focusing on the&nbsp; diffusion. His focus is instead as Bumz<br />Then says I the relationship between language and Nationalcharakter,<br />and here if course language is an expression of the volksgeist, the<br />charachter of. Apeople shaped the language... (32) and language in<br />turn shaped the world view of a people, the weltansicht. (32-33)<br /><br />* Here again is precisely the move in direction of the unique closed<br />people that I think Boas was resisting. Will have to see what Bunzl<br />does with this when we get to Boas...<br /><br />* Bunzl says here that Humboldt has basically developed a more<br />systematic approach to national charachter than Herder or Hamann.<br />G33)<br /><br />* Here again Bunzl pushes back insisting that Humboldt still<br />appreciated the universality of language. Ie I language was expressed<br />the human cavity for language, and of course all humans could learn<br />many languages. (34)<br /><br />* Now this general tension, to understand that in the particular one<br />could also work backward to the general is typical of German<br />historicist Thought, and yet what I think Bumzl is not getting is that<br />1) the neo Kantians reversed this stream, actually trying to get to<br />the universal, as did Lazarus and Steinthal I think, but 2) that boas<br />was attracted to this but ultimately moved in another direction. (34)<br /><br />* It was Steinthal and Lazarus that carried forward Humboldts<br />linguistics, while others ignored his work. (35)<br /><br />* In Alexaander Humboldt identifies the idea -- unity in diversity -- that I trace as being a<br />key part of the neo-Kantian thing, the way geography was the key<br />science in this context. And it is against this view that I see Boas<br />pivoting... (38)<br /><br />* Ritter was trying to establish a law of migrations... Boas must have<br />known this. (41)<br /><br />* Ratzel... 41-43. Bunzl places him in the line of Ritter...<br /><br />* Waitz and Bastian, counter-enlightenment!?!? I can sort of see that<br />but they retained a strong universalism. They were the liberal German<br />anthropologists!!<br /><br />* Waitz notion of the psychic unity of mankind distinct from the French<br />universalism (46)<br /><br />* Waitz moved closer to the relativism of Boas in his Anthropologie set<br />Nanaturvolker, though obviously maintaining the nature people culture<br />people distinction. (46)<br /><br />* Hmmm. I don't see a huge commonality btw Humboldt and the<br />Volksgeister...Humboldt was more into the individual essence, whereas<br />Steinthal and Lazarus and in particular Bastian were interested<br />getting to the universal level. (49)<br /><br />* I need to examine these claims a bit re Bastian's use of Humboldt a<br />bit...49-50<br /><br />* Very interesting quote from Bastian in which he suggests a loss of<br />hope that ethnology can help solve the fragmentation of culture. Bunzl<br />says this foreshadows Boas... (50)<br /><br />* Bastian nonetheless emphasized independent invention over diffusion,<br />thus conflicting with Ratzel. 51<br /><br />* I don't think Bunzl's use of the term counter enlightenment works<br />here.&nbsp; I also disagree with Zimmerman's use of anti humanism bit that<br />is better. I think Bastisn would have seen himself as an enlightenment<br />thinker... (52)<br /><br />* Bunzl sees Boas Naffin-a land text as clearly marked by Ratzel's<br />geographical determinism. (53) Bunzl also calls it a ""straightforward<br />anthropo-geographical investigation combining formal description of the<br />physical geography of the area with an analysis of the relation of its<br />inhabitants to their local surroundings..."" (53)<br /><br />* Yes but the missing context for this is neo-Kantianism it seems to<br />me... This uniting of the physical, the psychological and the<br />historical, this was neo-Kantian... (52)<br /><br />* Now in Boas section, mention of philosophers -- but no mention of who<br />-- that influenced Boas to move away from Fechnerian psychophysics....<br />(52)<br /><br />* How is this. Echoing Kant? Simply the notion of the division of<br />domains of knowledge!? This is not sufficient. (55)<br /><br />* Boas granted equal value to those desires affective and aesthetic,<br />no! Not in my reading. (55) this may be a point where I want to assert<br />my contrast with Bunzl?<br /><br />* Bunzl, like Stocking, sees Boas abandoning his geographical<br />determinism at the Ethnographic Museum. (55) here Bunzl says that Boas<br />had concluded from his Arctic studies that geographical causes were<br />not sufficient. He quotes Boas as saying that his Baffin island study<br />was a failure. And that there were other no external causes. (55) so<br />Boas shifts focus to the Northwest coast. Bunzl does not discuss Boas<br />the ""Central Eskimo,"" which I think bears the imprint of the kind of<br />approach to culture I traced. (55)<br /><br />* This is what shocks me, how the antisemetic context comes in merely<br />as an aside and nit an influence in his thought. Here Bunzl simply<br />cites it as a reason for his immigration as though this were<br />irrelevant to his thought. (56)<br /><br />* I really don't see why this must be a Humboldtian gloss...I don't<br />recall Boas himself citing Humboldt and at the end of the nineteenth<br />century this principle could have come from any number of sources.<br />Boas cites Goethe in The a study of Geography. Bryond that he gives<br />his own gloss on the distinction that Windelband had set up. Again<br />,here the neo-Kantian context seems more proximate!! (57)<br /><br />* Now the quote from the Museum debate that points most toward holism. (57)<br /><br />* Now here Bunzl brings up the two fold dimension of Boas ethnographic<br />project: 1) the examination of geographical distribution, 2) the focus<br />on physical and psychical charachter.<br /><br />* This is key and Lewis brings it up in a different way, more useful to<br />me, in his Boas and Darwinism paper. It is the oing into a ore<br />sophisticated examination of the individual in culture, that is where<br />I think Boas goes after WWI. (57, bottom)<br /><br />* Apparently boas criticized the Natuervoelker idea in The aims of<br />Ethnology. (59)<br /><br />* But is this really cultural relativism already? In my analysis I<br />think it is not. (59)<br /><br />* Need to look at this essay, but no, it seems not THAT similar. He is<br />not positing a volksgeist in the same way, because he is also saying<br />that there is no original basis for the existence of certain myths<br />among any given people. (59)<br /><br />* Interesting, that one of the responses to Boas theory from Powell was<br />that it would be too expensive and inefficient! (58)<br /><br />* Bunzl speaks of an aesthetic turn, by which he means the way BoAs<br />turned back toward a universalist physicist direction (Bunzl's<br />categories not mine) in his Aims of ethology, albeit as Bunzl tries to<br />show&nbsp; in the paragraphs that preceed in a relativistic frame. (59)<br /><br />* Bunzl says that at first in ""Aims of Ethnology"", Boas tried to<br />accommodate"" the evolutionist views, so that this essay sounds like<br />the physicist Boas. (58)<br /><br />* I want to argue with Bunzl here perhaps in the foots: the point<br />being that Boas was actually straddling these two points of view. I<br />already get at this in my analysis of the Study of Geography,when I<br />talk about how boas subordinated both points to history, which of<br />course connects to the point that here Bumzl makes next, the critique<br />if the Naturvoelker idea. (58)<br /><br />* Now Bunzl argues that Boas developed his link to Humboldtian<br />tendencies as Bunzl understands them in ethnographic works btw<br />1891-1896. Later on this page&nbsp; he calls these tarte-distribution<br />studies. These are exactly the pieces out of which I would reconstruct<br />a distinct story. (60) Bunzl sort of appropriately relates boas method<br />to that of Ratzel, ie tracing the relations between peoples as created<br />by diffusion.mhe pushers back on this assertion noting the also that<br />Boas also allowed for indedent invention, but he fails to make<br />anything of Boas doing this,a s though it were just a minor difference<br />with Ratzel. And then he says that boas had at this point ""returned to<br />the theoretical stance that he had taken in the museum controversy.<br />(60) but really? Just a return? There is too much of a I ray view on<br />this essay, between physics and human sciences that boS is just sento<br />tack back and forth across rather than&nbsp; actually work with. (60)<br /><br />* It is in ""Limitations.."" That Boas thinks all this<br />counter-enlightenment thought come together. (61) I am not impressed.<br />The elements are 1) skepticism regarding universal laws, 2) rejection<br />of the psychic unity of humankind, 3)focus on individuality of<br />phenomena, 4) emphasis on actual history. 1 I think is true enough,<br />but 2 is wrong in my view. What is universal has just changed. It is<br />the individuals oness to socialization. 3 and 4 are true enough but<br />not very theoretically significant. (61)<br /><br />* Boas Bunzl says only presented his view of theory to the public after<br />gaining a positional the A!NH in 1895, in his 1896 ""Limitations...<br />Essay. boas presented the paper at the meeting of the AAA, where the<br />year before Brinton had given a paper, called the ""Aims of<br />Anthropolgy"" where he insistedon the doctrine of indedent<br />invention. (60)<br /><br />* Bunzl says Boas Alternate method was this investigation of customs in<br />relation to the total culture of the tribe, and this is another of<br />this key holistic phrases. I need to deal with this probably. Was this<br />really the pointBoas was making in Limitations? (62)<br /><br />* Boas never mentioned Humboldt except in one essay on Mexico, but<br />Bunzl still thinks he was ""intimately familiar"" with Humboldt. (63)<br />rperhaps because he met Steinthal personally at the museum and<br />Steinthal may have directed hi directed hi to his own edition of<br />Humbldts writings on language. (63)<br /><br />* Then Bunzlends the section by making tenuous connections to Alexander<br />Humboldt, iesuggesting a ""cosmographical mapping"" (62)<br /><br />* Right so now Bunzl just sees the Humboldtian approach to language as<br />systems with their own inner structure etc become central... This is<br />just the holistic point of view, this is just echoing Stocking's point<br />on the alternating sounds essay that Bunzl also discusses here, that<br />this is really Boas clearest statement about holism and relativism, ie<br />holistic culture. (64-65)<br /><br />* Bunzl says Boas Handbook is a realization of Humboldts plan for the<br />study of languages... (66)<br /><br />* Bunzl's take on how the handbook related to Boas' thinking about<br />culture, which he s was not systematic, but the Handbook and the<br />focus on language evidently helped boas to understand the<br />psychological problem of how diffused elements were acculturated, that<br />he had noticed as a problem I his trait distribution studies. (69)<br />indeed this makes sense, but my point would be that the this focus did<br />not really take odd until WWI. Not that it wasn't there, which it was<br />even earlier, but it did not become dominant in the discipline. (69)<br /><br />* Secondary rationalization (71)<br /><br />* The idea is that language provided an ""un obstructed"" point of view<br />into the workings of culture...the culture indicated here is the<br />holistic culture concept. Bunzl is just maintaining the party line...<br />(71)<br /><br />* No I think it shouldn't be traced to Humboldt or to Herder. That is<br />what I am arguing against. He had his own non Humboldtian historicist<br />gloss"" on this stuff. So this is perhaps what I need to make more<br />clear in my revision. (72-73)<br /></span></p>"
"""The Foundations of All Future Researches"": Franz Boas, George Hunt, Native American Texts, and the Construction of Modernity","p. 498 -   Boas's Textual Ideology

-- Why was Boas so focused on text- collection?  The authors link this to Boas' connection to a ""European philological tradition"" rooted in Herder and which came to Boas perhas through Heymann Steinthal, who had been a pupil of Alexander von Humboldt.    for citations f.n. 68.

--The authors, esp. f.n. 68 note that a philological tradition was long established in the American tradition.  

-- They quote Boas as seeing anthropology as needing to develop the same knowledge in language as those who studied ancient history could boast.  He saw philology as the key.  So texts taken down in Native language were the most valuable form of text.  (499-500) 

-- Authors note that Stocking saw Boas' approach to ""primtiive literarture"" as expressing a Herderian perspective of the literature as revealing a people's ""...'whole ocncpet of the world,' its 'individuality'--one might almost say, its 'genius.'"" (500, quoted from Stocking Race, Culture...p. 224.)  They also site another article of theirs on Herder entitled ""Langauge Philosophy as Language Ideology: John Locke and Johnaa Gottfried Herder"" in Regimes of Language,)

-- The authors note Boas's focus also on primitive literature as art also...That is art as plastic form (material culture) as well as something which carries meaning.  This dualism of art was helpful to him they say in managing the tensions between the universal and the particular (500-501)

-- REgards the content of primitive literature...Boas developed confidence over his career that such texts could provide a phenomenological account of how a given tribe saw things of which things interested them.  (501-502)

-- They note that Boas also understood that art/stories could ""shape experience""...they acted as symbols.  (502)

-- The focus on texts, also functioned as an ""indirect"" way into the history of the native groups, for whom no other form of information was available... (502)"
The Victorian Connection,"00 Summary 00

Hall traces a connection between U.S. and British elite intellectuals whose views are influenced by a conjunction of Unitarianism and Liberalism.  Their interest in democracy is rooted not only in nonconformity but also a sense of  need for an elite who posessess intellectual authority and guides the masses.  He traces this connection very well, both in terms of specifying the personal contacts that formed the ""Victorian connection"" and in terms of establishing its basic political point of view"
Getting Spliced: Modernism and Sexual Difference,"p.103-106 Pound and Gender

Pound's idea ""about relatoins bewteen the sexes can only be described as increasingly phallic in emphasis."" (103)

He wrote to M. Moore in 1919  a letter that open with a poem in place of a saluation: ""...it began: 'The female is a chaos/the male/is a fixed point of stupidity.'"" (103)  In his preface to a translaoitn of Gourmon't <i>Physique de l'amour</i> his thinking becomes clearer for he worte ""...'it is more than likely that the brain itself, is...only a sort of great clot of gential fluid held in suspense or reserve,' he posits that the act of thought occurs with 'man really the phallus or spermaozoide charging, head-on, the female chaos.'...'Even oneself has felt it, driving any new idea into the great passive vulva of London.'"" (103-4)  The female chaos then is "" a sort of negation"" a passivity.  (104)

More interesting, though, is the idea that Pound's conception of masculinity was actually threatened, the old feeling of the male being overwhelmed and Burke (like Banner about the anthropologist men) connects this to ways in which an expat intellectual in London was seen in Ford Madox Ford's words as ""something less than a man"" (quoted on 104).   (104-105)  And Burke sees heightened moment of this in meeting btw Pound and the sculptor Henri Gaudier-Brzeska in 1914 when Pount explained that the suffragist movmenet was ridiculous because: ""Why do [women] trouble themselves about these matters--why worry about their battle for emancipation--since they're strong enough to dominate us.""  (quoted on 105) and then he described how he admired the Roman matron Marozia who became powerful in Rome by marrying important men. (105) Then Gaudier-Brzeska dcied to sculpt a bust of Pound that would illustrate his ideas and Hugh Kenner sa this as a ""crucial and heroic momen in the development of Pound's aeshtetic.""  (105)  Burke writes that you can also see it as ""emblematic Pound's increasing anxiety about the connections between artistic genius and sexual difference."" (105) And she notes that Gaudier-Brzeska ""approached the monumental three-foot marble block that Pound gave him as if it were a megalith from the Easter Islands, endowed with primitive sexual energy.  His 'Hieractic Head of Ezra Pound,' or 'Ezra in the form of a marble phallus' (Wyndham Lewis' words), takes literally the idea of 'Pound as the seminal figure of modern poetry,' as well as his theory of the link between mascuinity and creative genius."" (105)  It also foreshadows his post-Vortacist call for ""a modern poetic language that would be 'harder and saner...'nearer the bone'...as much like granite as it can be, 'a masculine language free from the 'emotional slither' of nineteenth-century poetry.'"" (105)  But she points out that the opp. btw male and female forms of writing was already part of his Vortacism and she talks about a man as 1) a perceiving entity and 2) a directing entity, whereas he wants to be more the latter...again she connects this to his anxiety about mascuinity (105-6)

So what of his celebration of Moore and Loy.  He celebrated them for the wrong reasons, acc. to his own program and not considering the intent of their own poetry.  (104)  So therefore Pound ""cannot recognize the ways in which their awareness of themselves as women writers produced poetry that is at once part of the overall modernist project, yet distinct from it...""

Bürger und Bürgerlichkeit im 19. Jahrhundert,"<p>General Note March, 2013</p>
<p>Jürgen Kocka, ""Einletiung""</p>
<p>* The book emerged from an interdiscplianry symposium at the Zentrum fuer interdisziplinaere Forchung (ZiF) in Bielefeld 12-14 March 1985. It brought together hitorians, literary, social, and art historians.(7)</p>
<p>* He traces some of the different meanings/uses of the term in the different disciplines on 7-8. He question though for the ZiF symposium was whether the term could function as a interdisciplinary key concept (Schlüsselbegriff) for research on the 19th century. (9) In other words, could the concept make it possible for the different scientists to treat their different objects of study in ways that allowed for asking questions that linked up with each other. (9-10)</p>
<p>* He then says that in addition to the interdisciplinary question, the question of Bürgerlichkeit was also important for the big question of german history, the Sonderweg thesis. He summarizes this thesis very nicely on 11. And then raises the critique</p>
<p>&gt; Diese Sonderweg-These hat sich nie allgemein durchgesetzt, kaum jemand vertrat sie zur Gänze, und die Kritik an ihr nahm in den letzten Jahren zu. Man wandte gegen sie ein, sie idealiere ""den Westen"", unterschätze die riesigen Unterschiede zwischen den westeuropäischen Staaten und interpretiere die deutsche Geschichte zu selektiv, zu negative-teleologisch. (11)</p>
<p>He goes on from here and what seems key is the idea also that the nineteenth century was not only the for-history of national socailism but also of the DDR and of the Bundesrepublik, and that there are llines of continuity with these developments as well. The concecept of Bürgerlichkeit comes in because as part of questioning this thesis, one also wants to ask how different was German from France or the US. Was it really true that Germany lacked a true Bürgerlichkeit? (11-12) In order to answer this question it was necessarz to explore the requirements of comparison, and in order to do that one had to define Bürgerlichkeit ina&nbsp; gernal sense in order to then make a comparison, or perhaps also discover that there were multiple variants of Bürgerlichkeit.

Beyond Separate Spheres: Intellectual Roots of Modern Feminism,"<p>p.091-95  New Psych and Experimental Perspective</p>
<p>Between 1900 and 1910, Columbia was an ""important center for the growing attack on armchair, evolutionary thinking, as a new generation of psychologists completed their doctorates and began ooking with jaundiced eye at the current understanding of the human and anmial minds."" (91)  Men like Edward Thorndike, Robert Woodworth, and Clark Wissler, who were ""less encumbered with the religious and philosophical baggage of the past than their mentors"" were part of this.  (91)  And Rosenberg argues ""[f]or all of thei rprejudices against women, they slowly put together the skeptical elements of a psychological system that could accomodate a very different view of feminine behavior from the one their own biases allowed."" (91)  In doing this, they moved against men like Lester Frank War and G. Stanley Hall, ""who indulged in romanti specualtions about the origins of human societ and intelligence."" (91)</p>
<p>Thorndiek cast doubt on ""animal instinct"" and he ocnlucded that neitheranimals nor humans could rely as ""heavily on either instinct or ratiocination as most social theorists assumed."" (92)</p>
<p>Clark Wissler in a 1901 doctoral thesis failed to find a correlation between lower mental activity and intelligence.  Then in further work he contiually failed to find a connection between morophology and ideas and this meant that Cattell's ""initila faith in the possiblity of constructing tests of intelligence basedo on simple motor tests would have to be abandoned."" (92) By 1909, Thorndie state d that ""sensory discrimination had little to do with general intelligence"" (92, a quote is on 92-93).</p>
<p>Further erosion of the evolutionary point of view, came with an attack on the Spencerian assumptiont hat ""mind and body formed a closed-energy system"" and that when demands on energy increased and became too much the mind also would weaken and nervous disease ensue.  [neurasthenia?]  Robert Woodworthy reversed this in 1906 based on experiements that showed that the the brain did not nescessarily weaken and that mental exhaustion was in part an ""emotional affair, a feeling of fatigue not a true fatige in the sense of incapacity."" (93)</p>
<p>In 1906, a debate between the old and new guard emerged sponsored by the <em>New York Independent</em>.  Lester War and G. STanley Hall on one siide and the youn Columbia cytoloigst Edmund Wilson and Wissler on the other.  Wilson attacked Ward's ""anthroporphic description f the origins of sexual differentiaition, in which eh assumed that lowly organisms discriminated among seual contenders in the same way that human beings do"" (94).  Wissler challengedthe ""imposition of physiological laws onto human intelligence. ""It is curious...that it has always seemed necessary to carry the theory  of evolution up through morphology into the psychic life of animals and  men and finally into those human practices that are designated  conventional.  While there is doubtless some connection between the  fundamental elements of psychic life and physiological function, the  direct connection between the details of ideas and such function is not  clear.""

"Creating a Female Dominion in American Reform, 1890-1935","p.027-31  Hull House, Reform and Progressive Era

Muncy argues that women were among the first professionals to turn to the state as a means to solving a social problem.  "" Becaue their professional situtions thus predisposed them to see governmental intervention as the solution to social problems, women at Hull House counte d among America'sfirst progressives."" (27) 

So Muncy thinks these women have a special meaning for Progressivism.  Progressivism characterized perhaps by emphasis on ""efficiency"" and on the invovlmentof the state in private life. These factors distinguisedh ""Gilded Age agitators"" from Progressives.  

Giventhis def'n women ""loomed large in progressive reform.""  (30) But women did not set out to be reformers.  They were rather :""women trying to fulfill existing social expectations for self-sacrificing female service while at the same time satisying their need for public recognition, authority, and independence."" (30)  Women were thus  ""one of the causes of Progressive reform...""  (30)

She turns to Florence Kelley and speaks of how she pioneered social research as a means to lobbying government to change law (prohibit child labor), but after when Kelley worked as a factory inspector she was removed and her law gutted.  Wtihout the vote the only way to gain infuence was by ""replacing the patronage system with hiring based on expertise..."" (31)

Theoretically the publishing revolution of the 1830s and 1840s was supposed to aid them.  Low price of books and magazines.  But they didn't the marketplace created the conditions for the ind of education of public opinion that they desired.  (91)  Wroried for isntance about the contents of the New York ledger.. (91)  This was the basis for the founding of periodicals like Putnam's (1853), the Atlantic Monthly (1857); the Nation (1865); the Galaxy (1866) and in England the Saturday Review (1855) and the Fortnightly Review (1865).  (92)

They also sought to use the university.  ""Apart from establishing journla which were undre their own controo, they also proposed to refashion the university into an instrument for training the right sort of leaders."" (93) (93-94)

Hall concludes by suggesting that they succeeded saying that they ""transformed the structure of cultural authority."" (94)"
The Effect of Bureaucracy on the Professional Autonomy of Professions,"00 Summary Note 00 

This is an empirical study of the effective of bureaucracy on autonomy.  It's basic
claim, based on responses to a series of questionaires given to physicians in a variety of bureucratic circumstnaces, is that large, medium and small bureaucratic organizations effect different aspects of physisians' sense of auotnomy in different and unpredictable ways.  I am not interested in the articles' particular findings, but it has a series of definitions and insights that are of interest to me. 

Most writers on the professions -- the author cites Weber , Mills, and Robert Merton -- have indicated the belief that bureaucracies undermine the professional autonomy that is necessary for professionals to do their work successfully (30).  Engles points out however that in the case of doctors modern medicine is often seen as relying upon bureaucracies: ""Today, quality service involves specialization, the employment of large and expensive equipment, and coordination of the activities of groups of specialists.  Since these are characteristics which we have defined as bureaucratic, and since they are now important for the rendering of quality medical care, it is apparent that developments in medical practice have imposed bureaucratic requirements on the profession, and tha tthe two strutures have become more compatible.""

Emerson went to England where he was mocked except by merchant-manufacturers and scholar thinkers.  Here the connetion began.  Emerson connects with Arthur Hugh Clough then a tutor at Oxford.  Clough wasunable to ""reconcile hi radical views on religionand politics with an academic position.  1852 he comes to Boston where he establishes himself a a member of the literary community.  Clough helps popularize Matthew Arnold.  (85)  Clough, Hall says, was alluring ""as a representative man, for the crisis of faith he felt so intensely was felt also by the intellectuals of Concord-Cambridge-Boston.""

The decline of poltiical legitimacy did not , however, stop in the area of service provision [i.e. the government thinking of itself as offering services to citizen-consumers, i.e. the Arbeitsamt becomes the Arbeitsagentur]. Gradually it extended into the very core of citizenship, where the traditional relationship between citizens and the state became increasingly subject to unfavourable comparison with the relationship between customers and producers in the refurbished post-Fordist markets for consumer goods. To be more explicit: I would argue that the restructuring of consumption aimed at restoring the dynamics of capitalist accumulation after the crisis of the 1970s made possible -- indeed, invited and cultivated -- attitudes and expectations on the part of customers-cum-citizens that inexorably began to radiate into what remained fo the public sphere.” (39) </span></p>

He thinks that there’s a contradiction in the idea of citzens as consumers. “...citizenship is by its very essence less comfortable than cusomership, and if measured by the same criteria must inevtiably lose out.” (41) What does he mean? It’s the way in which the new consumer never needs to compromise that is incompatible with the essence of citiznenship. The citizen “must subject their cpsecific collectively unexamined ‘raw’ wants to critical scrutiny in some sort of public dialogue”; and later: “Political participation in a democracy demands, in particular, a preparedness to justify and recalibrate one’s choices in the light of general principles, developing preferences not in the sne of diversifying, but rather of aggregating and unifyign them.” (41) Because he sees this as the essence of citizenship he argues that “citizenship is bound to look structurally similar to customership inthe mass markets of old...” (41) </span></p>

They mixed socially, sartorially, and hheld similar social ideals: ""Both groups conceived of themselves as guides for a democratic society that overestimated material success and undervalued 'the higher ideals of life.'  Both felt a common mission to civilize the masses on the one hand and subdue the upstart nouveaux riches on the other.  Both echoed the <i>Nation</i> and the <i>Atlantic in calling for 'an educated class amongst us, to be the guardians of the traditions and feelings and aspirations of high culture, and the diffuser of an atmosphere of thought and study--a kind of barrier, too, agianst the gross materialism of the time, the growing tendency to estimate the value of everything in dollars and cents, and to despise or shirk all discipline of mind or body which does not promise a speedy return in hard cash.'  This class would constitute, said William T. Harris, U.S. Commissioner of Education, an 'aristocracy of culture,' disputing alike the claims of mere wealth and the prerogatives of birth.'"" (10)"

Giddings came to Columbia from Bryn Mawr as part of creation of two new chairs in history an dosociology that came a in exchange with Dean John Burgess for devoting teaching horus to teaching Barnard students. (149)   Giddings had begun with Spencer but also like Ward had recated against that point of view, thinking that humans had reached a point of social development in which they could correct things through reform and control.  (150).  Women attracted to his courses because he taught about philanthropy  and understood sociology as the ""scientific groundwork on which a true philanthropy must build."" (quoted on 151).  He also attracted them, as had WArd, Small, Dewey and Mead, because of the approach which tried to cut a line between idealism and positivism, and these ideas were appealing to women trying to understand the meaning of sexual division. (151) 

Gidding had an idea of ""self-realization"" the greater facility of which among humans would result from progress which he defined in terms of a growing unity, of ""increasing intercourse, a multiplication of relationships, an advance in material well-being, a growth of population, an evolution of rational conduct."" (quoted on 151).  

Self-realization appealed to Parsons, Rosenberg says, because it was seen as a ""weapon against the constraints that middle-class Victorian society imposed on female achievement."" (152) Even though Giddings was not a supporter of women's movement. (152) 

Parsons went to graduate school, first worked wit h Nicholas Murray butler in philosophy, writing on colonial management in her first book.  Then with Giddings on poor relief. .  (154)  She did not see family life as a hindrance to her work.  (153-4).  Married and then went back to work as a teacher at Barnard until 1905, when her husband's political career began.

<p>Deegan argues that women's work reflected the ""sexual division of labor"" as in all other academic disciplines.  Women's work in sociology ""stressed an applied compassionate world view.  Women labored in the community, often in settlement houses in the poorer districts of cities.  The more 'cerebral' work of theory development occured in the academy and 'belonged' to the realm of men.  Prior to World War I, this sexual division of labor was cooperative and permeable.  After 1918, these worlds became distinct, often hostile, and sharply segregated."" (143)  She says the ""golden age"" of women's particpation ended after 1918, when ""a massive, male-orchestrated erosion of their thought and practice ensued.  Structurally, the female sociologists were pushed out of sociology and transferred <em>en masse</em> to other fields, often social work.  They were no longer identified as professional sociologists, male-identified historians of the discipline erased their contributions from the annals of sociology.""

"The Decline of the German Mandarins:  The German Academic Community, 1890-1933","<p>p.086-090 Opposition btw Kultur &amp; Civilization</p>
<p>So Ringer clearly posits the idea that the German mandarins (as part of their ""unique"" reaction to modernity) developed this opposition between civilization and ""Kultur.""  He lays out this argument in these pages.</p>
<p>His argument goes like this: The German mandarins were focused on presreving moral implications of Christianity.  They furhter opposed the utilitirian components of Anglo-French Enlightenment, which the yhad to fight in their own land at the University of Halle where there had been a search for useful knowledge. (86)</p>
<p>They utlimately expressed their ""ideal of leanring as the direct antithesis of practical knowledge"" in the notion sof <em>Bildung </em>and <em>Kultur</em>.  These terms, Ringer says, ""became current in Germany during the cultural revival of the later eighteenth century."" (86) Ringer also argues that these words were part of a ""semantic conquest"" that ""established the leadership of the mandarins...the newly introduced vocabularly revealed the full extent of the elite's claim to special authority."" (86)</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Bildung</span></p>
<p>The meaning of <em>Bildung</em> revealed in <em>Der grosse Brockhaus</em>, a standard eencyclopedia published between 1928 and 1935.  It defined the word this way: ""The fundamental concept of pedagogy since Pestalozzi, <em>Bildung</em> means forming the soul by means of the cultural environment.  <em>Bildung</em> requires: (a) an individuality whcih, as the nique starting point, is to be developed into a formed or value-saturated perosnality; (b) a certain universality, meaning richness of mind and person, which is attained thorught he empathetic undeerstanding and experiencing [<em>Verstehen und Erleben</em>] of the objective cultural values; (c) totality, meaning inner unity and firmness of character."" (Quoted on 86)  This was about self-formation in other words and to that end Karl Jaspers in 1923 distinguished between instruction (<em>Unterricht</em>) and education (<em>Erziehung</em>) noting that only the latter was capable of ""forming the personality in accordance with an ideal of <em>Bildung</em>, with ethical norms..."" (quoted on 87)</p>
<p>Ringer tries to cahracterize the concept: it is about ""inner growth"" based in religious and neohumanist conceptions; it is based on an ""experience"" of ""objective"" cultural values.  The terminology he says is ""Idalist or neo-Idealist."" (87)</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Kultur</span></p>
<p>This word came from Cicero's <em>cultura animi</em> and was adapted by Samuel Pufendorf and Gottfried von Herder.  It was closely tied to <em>Bildung</em>, represneteing at first a ""personal culture,"" an ideal of well-formed mind and spirit, a unity.  Then it began to be used more generally in Germany, but the same trasnsition did not occur in France,where culture remained on the personal level: <em>culture de l'esprit</em>.  Instead in France <em>civilisation</em> which had been introduced by physiocrat Marqui de Mirabeau came to ""stand for the totality of  man's social and intellectual creaitons and arrgangements."" (88)  ONce these two distinct usages developed, Ringer says ""a fascinating chain of assocaiitons led German intellectuals to see an antithesis between the two concepts."" (88)  He says that in 18th century Germany the ""worldly manners"" of German aristocrats were modeled on the French.  He implies that it was a total and complete importation and that the German mandarins saw it that way: ""[The German mandarin] did not often encounter well-educated courtiers, and when he did, he generally found men who could imitate French forms without being able to think for themselves."" (88)  Ringer insists that on this basis a ""pattern of assocaitaitons...grew up around the contrast between sophisticated social forms, skilled manners,   and worldly knowledge on theone hand, and genuine spirituality or cultivated wisdom on the other.""  He says that Norbert Elias described these and refers to his <em>Uber den Prozess der zivilisation</em>, vol 1: <em>Wandlungen des Verhaltens in den weltlichen Obsersichten des Abendlandes</em> (1939), pp. 1-64.  He notes that Kant had distinguished between civilization and culture identifying civ. with good manners and oscial niceities and culture with art, learning and morality, but Kant had not develpeop the line tha tblamed the French.  (88)Elias he says was interestedin this latter development.  He summarizes it this way: ""The French continued to identify with an internationally conceived mission of civilization.  The Germans, finding it difficult and yet desirable to define themselves as a nation, tended to see uniquely German characteristics in their prerference of culture over civilization."" (89)  Ringer further suggests that this distinction did not fade because it ""continued to be nourished by a social reality,"" (89) i.e. the way it ""reflected the mandarins' interested preference for  a paritcular ocnception ofknowedge.""

"Steppin' Out: New York Nightlife and the Transformation of American Culture, 1890-1930","<p>Chapter 1: Victorian Culture and Amusements</p>
<p>* Americans in the second half of the nineteenth century ""underwent a process of consolidation and refinement"" which came from a ""desire for greater rational order..."" (5) Erenberg links this to studies by Higham, Danield Walker Howe, Wiebe that link a emphasis on ""formalism"" and ""gentility"" to industrialism, urbanization, mass immigration.  SEe f.n. #1 where he discusses these texts.  Note his explanation of HIgham's thesis in particular from <em>From Boudnlessness to Consllidation</em>...that the above three factors provoked a ""need to impose social control on rampnant individualism in the urban context."" (25)</p>
<p>* They did this in part to distinguish themselves from ""the lower orderrs by their refined moral standards, hard work, and elevated leisure pursuits."" This meant that they set up sets of standards about what types of amusements were ok and which were too ""fast"".  Much of these restrictions rested upon women, whereas men had a ""greater run of public life.""  (5)</p>
<p>* Erenberg uses memoirs of Henry Seidel Canby who was the editro of the Saturday REview from 1924 to 1936 as a window in to this Protestant America.  He grew up in Wilmington, DE.  Important values were ""faith, hard work, self-sufficiency, and a belief in moral progress grounded in the refined woman and the autonomous family."" (6)  These values understood to be unique posession of protestant whites and not of Irish and blacks: the workers.  ""Business success"" of particualr important virtue.  The young male learned in the family and the schoolroom ""that his path to succses lay in his 'pioneer's training in self dependence, his sense o froom at the top, and his certainty that work can get him there.' For Protestants, the economy represented a moral frontier, where individuals who practiced self-discipline and willpower whiile husbanding their scarce energy would be rewarded by mobility and ordered progress."" (7)</p>
<p>* Women played a ""separate role in the private world of the home.""  In the home, Erenberg writes, mothers taugh their chilren the sense of duty and ""ought"".  (7)  But though women's power increased in the home, they rarely entered the ""public world of men"" Erenberrg writes, except he say quote CAnby in an ""attempt to make that world Our American home."" (7) [This latter move shoudl perhaps n ot be discounted as much as Erenberg seems to.]</p>
<p>* While women were meant to teach duty, the danger was that they might arouse passion.  Thus ""wives and daughters were expected to conform to the 'kind of sexual relationship that made the least trouble.  Women had to be what men were not--refined, controlled, nurturing, self-effacing, and stable--so as to provide the one noncompetetive and nurturing environment in the anarchic and hostile owrld of nineteenth-century economic competition."" (7)  [i.e. this idea that women should provide an ""elysium"" for men]. (7)  This placed a kind of double standard on women wehre they were supposed to be pure and ""above the demands of the body and above the sexual status of men."" (7)  Thsu romance and sexuality were distinct things for Victorians.  As CAnby put it, woman ""carried with her the sanctions and refusals of society."" (8)  They were meant to be the source of order, stabilizing men's identities.</p>
<p>* Key event in Wilmington was the annual ball.  These were women's debuts in public, but also reflected the concerns of ""female morality, class status, and privacy.""  (8)  E quotes CAnby: ""A girl at a ball was still a woman on show, a custodian of honor and the home."" (8)  And: ""Wiles were allowed her, but only to advertise her charms.  She could flirt and be gay and tease and be teased, but one hint of the sexual made her 'common,' which was only owe word above vulgar."" (8)</p>
<p>* In NY City things different: more money, people from all regions, people making fortunes in mercantile and banking pursuits and those who had succeeded in industrial enterprises.  The elite was free from interactions with the lower classes that were a more present ""other"" in Wilmington.  But here to the same concerns wtih ""decorum, social distinction, and self-control that CAnby found in Wilmington..."" (9)</p>
<p>* Account of Delmonico's, which began in 1848 and became more fancy as time went on.  Under direction of Lorenzo Delmonico it became a ""civilized and orderly culinary institution.""  He trained his waters in deferential service.  His menus were sophisticated.  Delmonico's moved up Broadway and then Fifth Ave over time.  By 1860, it was at 5th Ave. and 14th STreet.  Delmonico had then added a great French che, Charles Ranhoffer and he was there from 1863to 1895.  He is mannerisms of the postwar Europeans ""acted as leaven for rough democratic habits.""  And this sign of European cultivation instead of becoming a sign of distinction ""was rapidly becoming the basis forr the identies of fashionable urbanites."" (10)  Delmonico's became a sociqal institution and a ""premier place for fashionable dining."" (10)  The empahsis was not on abundance as it had been in 1842 when Charles Dickens first dined there, but on ""a greater delight in 'economy, order, balance, and smooth progression of courses.'"" (10)  It was a center of ""national , polical, social and business life.""

Editor's Introduction,"<p>Notes trying to get understanding of Kant's Aesthetics</p>
<p>* Kant had no plan for a series of three critiques (ie <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em>, <em>Critique of Practical Reason</em>, and the <em>Critique of the Power of Judgement</em>) at firs.&nbsp; Kant had originally thought that the <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em> alone would be sufficient to ""erect a system of theoretical and practical philosophy, or as he called them the metaphysics of nature and the metaphysics of morals..."" (xiii)&nbsp; Guyer notes that he did provide the first in the <em>Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science</em> and the second eventually in the 1797 <em>Metaphysics of Moral</em>s--the second after a ""delay"" while he wrote the <em>Critique of the Power of Judgement</em> and by the 1793 <em>religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason</em> and the 1795 <em>Toward Perpetual Peace</em>.&nbsp; (xiii)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Guyer quotes a letter to Karl Leonhard Reinhold, who was helping to popularize Kan'ts writings.&nbsp; The letter came after Kant's completion of the <em>Critique of Practical Reason</em>. The letter suggests that he'd realized that it was necessary to create three critiques, one for each of the three faculties of the mind: cognition, feeling, and desire.&nbsp; (xiii-xiv)&nbsp; Kant associates the faculty of feeling with taste/aesthetics.&nbsp; Cognition with pure reason and desire with practical reason or morals.</p>
<p>* Guyer wants to review Kan'ts earlier thinking about aesthetics and theology.&nbsp; In his first series of publications 1755-56 he was mostly concerned with science and metaphsyics and did not write on aesthetics or teleology.&nbsp; But in texts written between 1762 and 1766, he did.&nbsp; In an essay on <em>The only Possible Basis for a Proof of the Existence of God</em> in which he critiqued Descartes' ""ontological"" argument, he ""touched on teleology"".&nbsp; In <em>Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime</em> (1764), which was influenced by Burke's<em> 1757,&nbsp; A Philosophical Enquiry into the Original of Our Ideas of the Sublime and the Beautiful</em>, he examines the ""differences int he capacities ofr these feelings [of eauty] between the two sexes and among diverse cultures and nations."" (xv)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* In disscussion of his lectures for the winter semester of 1765-66 on metaphysics, logic, ethics, and physical geography..., he also expalined why he would discuss aesthetics:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">I shall be lecturing on logic of the first type [a crituqe and canon of <em>sound understanding</em>].&nbsp; To be more specific, I shall base my lectures on Meier's hand-book, for he...stimulates us to an understanding, not only of the cultivation of reason in its more refined and learned form, but also of the development of the ordinary understanding, which is nonetheless active and sound.&nbsp; The former serves the life of contemplation, while the latter serves the life of action and society.&nbsp; And in this, the very close relationship of the materials under examination leads us at the same time, in the <em>critique of reason</em>, to pay some attention to the <em>critique of taste</em>, that is to say, <em>aesthetics</em>.&nbsp; The rules of the one at all times serve to elucidate the rules of the other.&nbsp; Defining the limits of the two is a means to a better undersanding of them both."" (xvi) \</p>
</blockquote>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">So Kant saw aesthetics as a way to stimulate a cultivation of reason on and ""ordinary"" level of understanding related to every day life and society.&nbsp; Interesting!!</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">*&nbsp; Guyer says Kant includes more discussion of aesthetics re his lectures on ""anthropology"" in winter semester 1772-1773.&nbsp; These lectures went about the ""proper and aberrant functioning of human cognition, feeling, and ddesire, with an emphasis on both individual and cultural differences in the function and use of these faculties."" (xvi)&nbsp; Guyer concludes that as early as 1772-1773 then Kant had already formed his notion of the tripartite divison of the human mind (cognition, feeling, desire), and also the association of taste and feeling.&nbsp; Guyer thus argues that the ""central thought"" of the <em>Critique of the Power of Judgement</em> was already established in Kant's mind.&nbsp; That ideas was...</p>
<blockquote>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">that in a judgement of taste a person can claim intersubjective validity for the feeling of pleasure that she experiences in response to a beautiful object because the pleasure is produced, in an attitude of disinterested contemplation, not by a practical concern for utility or advantage in the possession of the object, but by the free and harmonious play of the cognitive faculties of imagination and understanding that the beautiful object induces, and taht seh can rightly claim such validity for her feeling because we all share these cognitive faculties and they must work pretty much the same way in all of us..."" (xvii)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">* That he had formed this understanding though is distinct from any plan to write a critique of taste.&nbsp; He originally thought only to write one critie, the <em>Critique of Pure Reason </em>and that he then could provide a systematic metaphsics of nature and morality, and perhaps Guyer guess, also principles of feeling, without a critique of the faculty of feeling, ""any more than he would need an additional critique of the faculty of desire or practical reason before he could write his metaphysics of morals."" (xviii)</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">* When Kant wrote the first critique, however, he seemed to doubt that there was any possibility of writing a sysetmatic metaphysics of the principles of taste.&nbsp; (xviii)&nbsp; This seems to ahve to do with what people describe as the autonomy that Kant gave to aesthetics.&nbsp; Guyer quotes Kant on xix importantly from the <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em> where Kant was expalaing his ""theory of space and time as nothign but the pure forms of the human mind for the intuition of external objets and our own inner sstates."" (xix)&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The Germans are the only one who now employ the word ""aeshtetics"" to designate that which others call the critique of taste.&nbsp; The ground for this is a failed hope, held by the excellent analyst Baumgarten, of bringing the critical judging of the beautiful under principles of reason, and elevating its rules to a science.&nbsp; But this effort is futile.&nbsp; For the putative rules or critera are merely empirical as far as their sources are concerned, and can therefore never serve as <em>a priori</em> rules according to which our judgements of taste must be directed, rather the latter constitutes the genuine touchstone of the correctness of the former.&nbsp; For this reason it is advisable again to desist from the use of this term and to save it for that doctirne which is true science. (quoted on xix).</p>
</blockquote>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Ie Guyer says that this means that here Kant believed, and thsi was consistent with what Kant had written in his lectures on anthropology, judgements of taste were <em>empirical</em>, even if they involved claims about how others should respond in terms of feelings of pleasure.&nbsp; This meant, and Kant had written this before, that people *learn* from society to make the correct judgements.&nbsp; Without society they won't know how to respond.&nbsp; So Guyer thinks that in 1781 Kant did not think that a systematic treatment of the principles/metaphyiscs of taste was possible.&nbsp; (xix)</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">* So then Guyer returns to his central question, having to do with what Kant seemed to discover after completing the <em>Critique of Practical Reason</em> that led him to believe he could establish a critique of taste.&nbsp; <strong>Guyer thinks it must have been based in a new&nbsp; <em>a priori </em>principle</strong>, specifically ap principle relatin got the ""similarities among human minds, for that is what judgements of taste claim, withotu depending upondeterminate predicates of particular objects, for that is what Kant abjures."" (xxi) Guyer further guess: ""And perhaps this is what in the most general way teleology suggested to Kant: an <em>a priori principle </em>about the relation between the human mind and the nature that surroudns it, including other human minds, that can give us confidence in the validity of our judgements without directly giving use new concepts of objects."" (xxi)</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">* This new a priori principle that Kant saw himself formulating in the<em> Critique of the Power of Judgement</em> was key for Kant to the cirtique of taste and teleology.&nbsp; (xxi)</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">* Kant also revealed a a new kind of judgement: ""namely the idea that both judgements of taste and jdugements about the purposiveness of natural objects are forms of a hitherto uncrecognized kind of judgement, which Kant calls <em>reflecting judgement</em>..."" (xxi)&nbsp; Before Kant had seen the ""ordinary function of judgement as that of subsuming a particular under a universal that is antecedently given to us, such as a pure concept in mathematics or an empiricial concept in scientific classification,..."" (xxii)&nbsp; Now Kant calls that ""determining judgement"" and distinguishes it from ""reflecting judgement"" ""in which we are not given a concept under which to subsume a particular but are instead given a particular for which we must seek to find a universal, a concept or rule of some kind that we are not immediately given."" (xxii)&nbsp;&nbsp; A lot of interpretation of Kant's third critqiue is about whether thsi notion is really new vv Kant's thought.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">* The deepest connection betweeen taste/aesthetics and teleology for Kant, Guyer says, has to do with something he writes in the concluding section of the Introduction to the third critique: ""the power of j dugement provides the mediating concept between the concept of nature and teh concept of freedom, which makes possible the transition from the purely theoretical to the purely practical, from lawfulness in accordance with the former to the final end in accordance with the latter,</p>"
German Jews beyond Judaism,"<p>General Notes 10/12</p>
<p># George L. Mosse, *German Jews Beyond Judaism* (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, c1985)<br /><br />&gt; Note session 10/2012: Reading for Manifold Origins article. Wanting to get a better idea of German-Jewish identity in Germany in the mid-ninteenth century vv the kind of claims that Hacohen makes about Austrian Jews: that they embraced a kind of cosmopolitan universalism wrapped up with being German. What's confusing about Hacohen's article is that he's talking about Vienna. Does this apply to German-Jews? Were they more nationalistically German? Where's the line and the difference?<br /><br />&gt;Critical Notes: <br />&gt;&gt;* Mosse seems centrally concerned with the concept of ""identity"" and with the search for new identities. It shows up in his Preface when he notes that in courses he was teching at U Wisconsin in the 1960s there were ""young people searching for a new identity."" (ix) And he notes that the ideas he will discuss in this book supplied ""an inspiration which their own American tradition had somehow failed to provide."" (ix) Then he admits to having had ""similar experiences in German in recent years. Some of the German ideas which had provided German-Jewish intellectuals with their identity were familiar, but their Jewish context was all but forgotten."" (ix) He's dancing around something here. Is this a Jewish idnetity that is also confidently universalist and enlightened? That American identity has failed to provide? For Jews, or for all American kids? <br />&gt;&gt;* VV the Manifold Origins article, this piece provoked an idea about how I might argue vv Boas and aesthetics. The key point that provoked this idea that point that Mosse makes on p.11 that the turn away from the classical ideal of *Bildung* saw a ""detachment"" of the concept, and the aesthetic ideal, from the notion of individuality. As a result, the notion of aesthetics was linked more with a kind of emotionality and not so much to the notion that beauty reinforced in the individual an attentiveness to rational clarity and simplicity, as Mosse describes on 6-7. *Bildung* then, Mosse says, is turned into a kind of collective adoration of certain notions of the good and the beautiful, both German and bourgeois. It is, in other words, rooted in more concrete forms, and treated less as an abstract ideal. And it becomes a way of ""gilding"" bourgeois materialism. How does this link to my argument in Manifold Origins? It changes slightly how I would narrate the shift I trace in Boas' thoguht I think. If there is a tendency to link the aesthetic (and Bildung) with an emotional undercurrent rooted in specifically German experiences...then what is Boas doing by contrast? He's reading Kant; he's allowing his emotional enthusiasm flow into a life that is entirely distinct while simultaneously insisting on <br /><br />## 1. A Cultural Emancipation<br /><br />* The German-Jewish dialogue he maintains ""determined what we perceive as Weimar culture (although this was only one of its aspects)--Jews interacting with Geramns on many levels of art and literature."" (1)<br /><br />* German Jews numbered only about 500-600K between 1871 and 1933, while the general population of Germany grew from 41 to 65 million. So Jews were a small minority of the German population: only about 1%. *<br /><br />* The liberation of Jews in Germany implied a ""dialogue"" Mosse wants to say and that dialogue involved shifts in German Jewish identity, but not a rejection of Jewishness: ""That Jewish identity had to be redefined, as Jewish emancipation led to Jewish assimilation, did not mean a rejection of that identity, as is often asserted in retrospect; German Jews were for the most part fully aware of their Jewish origins. As a 1930 article in the journal of the Central association of German Jews (C.V. Zeitung) put it, we must place the highest value on humanity as a whole, while at the same time loving the German people and our specific Jewishness."" (2)&nbsp; <br /><br />* On Bildung. Some good stuff. Very clear. ""The word *Bildung* combines the meaning carried by the English word 'education' with notion of character formation and moral education."" (3) Herder he says described it more or less as the ""Uoflding of his personality until he becomes an harmonious, autonomous individual exemplifying both the continuing quest for knowledge and the moral imperative."" (3) Goethe's phrase: ""much selbst, ganz wie ich da bin, auszubilden"" -- to cultive my self just as I am. (3) He says the proceses referred to an inward process,&nbsp; but not one focused on ""instinctual drives or emotional preferences"". One focused rather on ""the cultivation of reason and aesthetic taste; its purpose was to lead the individual from supersititon to enlightenment."" (3) He also empahsizes its processual dimension: ""self-cultivation was a continual process which was never supposed to end during one's life. Thus those who followed thisideal saw themselves as part of a process rather than as finished porducts of education."" (3) This concept he thinkw&nbsp; was ""ideal ready-made for Jewish assimilation, because it transcended all differences of nationality and religion through the unfolding of the individual personality."" (3) <br /><br />* Herder Mosse argues ""had already envisioned the concept of *Bildung* as a means of overcoming the inequality between men. He wanteeed to level the differences between the bourgeoisie and the aristocracy by confronting the nobility with an ideal which would deflate its pretensions."" (4) That same instrument Mosse notes could also be used to ""transcend the differences between teh German and the Jewish middle classes."" (4) Then he asserts that as such the *Bildung* ideal is essential to understanding ""German-Jewish consciousness"" (phrases like this show how this text may be dated): ""it was basic to Jewish engagement with liberalism and socialism, fundamental to the search for a new Jewish identity after emancipation."" (4) <br /><br />* He discusses the work of Berthold Auerbach who he says was ""considered by his fellow Jews to be one of the most representative German Jews of the nineteenth century"" (4) (whatever that means) whose in his *Schrift und Volk* ""called for relgion to become *Bildung*--'an inner liberation and deliverance of man, his true rebirth; not thorugh words or customs, but through his deeds, his character, the totality of his life, the cleansing and healing of all human labor.'""(4) Later this kind of hope was to become impossible, after the rise of a different kind of nationalism not rooted in Enlightened notions. e.g. he quotes Rabbi Ignaz Maybaum in 1939 in London who said that at this point those who did not believe in God faced a choice between ""faith and barbarism."" (4) <br /><br />* Mosse also points out that ther eason Jews took up the ideal of *Bildung* to the degree that they did had to do with their ""social structure"" ie the fact that although most of them were poor,a nd therre was only a small middle class, they accepted the idealof the ""bourgeoisie into which they had been emancipated"" because unlike other poor Germans they lacked ""organic or family ties to the lower classes and no experience with German popular piety and German popular cutlure."" (5) [ I wonder if that was really so true.. ] Anyway, what he means i sthat there was a kind of unusual alliance between the German liberal middle class and German Jews who were relatively poor by comaprison. As evidence of that Auerbach as the author of the *Black Forest Peasant Tales* (1843) ""enjoyed an unprecedented esteem and popularity among Jews and gentiles a like."" (5) In his *Schrfit und Volk* where he defined peasent society the ""peasants reflected a middle-class outlook on the world."" (5) Auerbach was born in a village. His peasents are ""assimilated into bourgeois society as they break out of their narrow regional vision and religious bigotry."" (5) Why? Because ""whatever one's class or station in life, 'the development of the human spirit knows no boundaries and cannot be confined by religious dogma.'"" (5) -- there's the *Bildung* idea. Jews, Mosse notes, rarely appear in these stories, and when Auerbach planned to write about a Jewish village, he stopped without explanation, Mosse thinks, because the ""subject was not congenial to one committed to transcending religious differenes through *Bildung*. That suffices, sort of, as an explantion; but perhaps also Auerbrach didn't want to try to tell the same story about Jews transcending their parochial attachments for fear of how it would be read in an era of increasing anti-Semetism as evidence of Jewish infiltration of the German nation? <br /><br />* In any caes, with the decline of *Bildung* as there occured a rise of a nationalism that showed ""peasents who exemplified the ideal of rootedness in the nation which they made their own"" (5), Auerbach's popularity declined. His peasant tales were now less popular than Hermann Löns *Der Wehrwolf* (1910) where the peasent sybmolized ""the elemental forces of Germanic nature, coursing beneath the surface, as they defend their land during the Thirty Years War; cruetly was accepted as a part of everyday life."" (5) Mosse contrasts this iwth Auerbach's *Barfüssle* where he says the moral is about transcending an impulse for revenge. This process gained speed at the end of nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries: ""*Bildung* and the Enlightenment, the substance of Auerbach's Jewishness, respected during the nineteenth century, were being repudiated at the beginning of the twentieth."" (5-6) <br /><br />* Now Mosse goes into the links between *Bildung* and the Enlightenment, saying that several ""presuppositions"" of the Enlightenment ""were basic to the concept of *Bildung*."" (6) He lists the following: ""the optimism about the potential of human nature and the autonomy of man; the belief that acquired knowledge would activate the moral imperative; and, last but not least, the belief that all who were willing to use and develop their reason could attain this ideal."" (6) Great quote by *Sulamith*: ""The possession of a higher *Bildung* is the knighthood of modernity."" (quoted on 6). This ""knighthood"" was more equal because accessible to everyone, Jews included.<br /><br />* Harmony was also key to the idea and this touched on the aesthetic. The emphasis on harmony was a reaction he says to ""a Germany touched by the industrialzation of Europe, frigented by the French Revolution."" (6) The aesthetic was key here becuase it was the ""keystone...linking the intellectual and the moral."" (6) Mosse says this is hard to understand for our age in which ""beauty has become relative and the aesthetic is either regarded as a luxury or trivialized into the knickknacks of daily life."" (6) But then there was, say for Humboldt, the powerful influence of the Greeks and the idea of ""Ancient beauty"" that Mosse says ""seemed to give form and direction to individual and communal ideals."" (6) The classics were thought to provide ""the modes of thought and taste essential to the cultivation of the personality. The aeshthetic was linked to the intellectual faculty, and both activated the mroal imperative which resided in every man."" (6) Here the beautiful was understood not in the romantic mode but as something linked to reason. Like Greek sculputure, the beautiful was conveived as ""harmonious and well proportioned, wthout any excess or false note which might disrupt its quiet greatness."" (6) Beauty then aided in ""controlling the passions, not in unleashing them, emphasizing self-control which the bourgeois prized so highly."" (6) Thus beauty for Humbold, for Goethe, and for Schiller symbolized an ""ideal of a shared humanity toward which *Bildung* must strive."" (7) Beauty then was a disciplining presence, keeping ""cruely, slackness, and perversity"" at bay. On this last point, Mosse sites Friedrich Schiller's *&amp;Uuml;ber die &amp;auml;sthetische Erziehung des Menschen*, citing p. 36 in a 1965 Stuttgarrt edition. So then the role of the artist could be to reveal ""true *Bildung*"".(7)&nbsp; Jewish writers participated in this tradition, and he notes that when Germans tried to ""nationalize and romanticize"" the idea toward th ened of the 19th century, Jewish writers became this concept of Bildung's main ""custodians."" (7) Re aesthetics, the transformation that the Germans follow is one in which beauty comes to serve more ""emotional needs rather than strengthening rationality and self-discipline."" (7) <br /><br />* Interestingly, Mosse notes that the emphasis on *Bildung* vv aesthetics was in addition to being an attempt to maintain control in the contenxt of poltiical and social disruption set off by the French Revolution and industrialization, it was also in its emphasis on aesthetics a response to ""the fact that the nineteenth century was becoming increasingly visually oriented age as the largely illiterate masses were integrated into politics and culture though the use of symbols--from cheap reproductions to national monuments."" (7) Eventually, this was a disadvantage for Jews who could be targeted through ""visual sterotypes"", but at first it worked in their favor, making it easy for Jews to ""embrace Europe"" as Sulamith said (7, bottom). in 1837 in Hamburg Rabbi Gotthold Saloman could praise King David as a man of *Bildung*. (7-8) And Ludwig Philippson's journal for rabbis could draw ""a sharp distinction in 1834 between the ceremonial culture of the ancient Jews and modern *Bildung*."" (8) <br /><br />* The Bildung idea was set against the vision of ""the masses."" The Jews who were emancipated in Germany at the same time as the ""German masses"" entered social and political life (8), reached for the *Bildung* idea in a way that the German masses did not. This commitment to Humbodlt's *Bildung* thus helped to alienate them from the ""German masses."" (What is this German masses??? ) (8) <br /><br />* Jews were also ""emancipated into"" the German wars of libreration against Napoliean. He describes taht Jews fought in these wars. Mentions a painting of 1835 by Moritz Oppenheim that depicts a Jewish volunteer returning hoem from war to celebrate sabbath. (9) The Jewish community of Berlin he says could exhort its departing soldiers: ""Never forget that all warriors are part of a common humanity."" (quoted on 9).&nbsp; The point here is that German natinoailsm at this stage was still ""at the crossroads"" and ""patriotism and cosmopolitanism were often joined"" (9) .&nbsp; He cites the poet Klopstock as a ""fanatic"" of German unification who he says ""held that Germans were ennobled by their tolerance toward other peoples."" (9) He says that following the Prussian victory over the French at the battle of Leipzig in 1814 ""there was a feeling of pride that Jews joined in the singing of Christian chorales during the celebrations and that 'cultured' men and women rejoined in the victory of German arms withotu regard to their religious differences."" (9) His way of summing thi sup is to say that ""Patriotism retained its eighteenth-century menaing of solidarity rather than domination."" (9) <br /><br />* In this line, Ernst Moritz Arndt, who exhorted Germans to fight for freedom against the French, tended to equates ""German freedom with the freedom of all mankind."" (9) -- interesting parallel here to that kindo f patriotism that is American in origin, that indicates a nationalism that is great vv the whole world, and not a particualr people.&nbsp; But Arndt also criticized those whose patriotism, as that of Nathan in Lessing's *Nathan der Weise* (1779), was ""one which loved the whole world while those at home were left to freeze int he cold."" (9) Eventually, this kind of critique targeted Jews who were then described as ""a cosmopolitan *Bildungsb*uuml;rger"" and ""made into a symbol for a commitment to *Bildung* and the Enlightenment that was said to have caused Germany's defeat by the French--and previoiusly enlightened thinkers such as Fichte, under the growing weight of nationalism, came to share this outlook."" (9) <br /><br />* Jews, however, did not follow this line from patriot to nationalist. *Bildung* implied instead a kind of autonomous development that led to a political stance vv the state. Humboldt had argued that self-cultivation would lead a man to enter poltiical life ""spontaenously"".&nbsp; And Humboldt warned against the idea of a strong state. (10)&nbsp; So within the *Bildung* ideal citizenship and individual freedom did not run counter to each other. Indeed, one could not exist without the other. ""What counted,"" Mosse says, ""was individual self-cultivation and the network of personal realtionshiops."" Auerbach wrote: ""The further modern *Bildung* progresses...the more it is based upon the individual from out of hiw own unique personlaity joines the state."" (quoted on 10). Mosse adds that in fact the ""eighteenth-century culture of friendship in Germany was part of the ideal of *Bildung* itself--differences of personality and character must be recognized adn then submerged in a common effort at self-cultivation."" (10) He cites Goethe's *Wilhelm Meiserter's Apprenticeship* where greatest happines comes from ""giving and receiveing out of each friend's richness of personality developed trhough mutual self-cultivation."" (10) In Lessing's *Die Juden* (1749) there is a Jew that meets a strange and says: ""I saw that although you indicated hostility toward my nation [the Jews], you were favorably disposed toward me. And a man's friendship, whoever he be, will always be invaluable to me."" (10) This ideal of freindship was important to Jews. And he notes that as in the frontispiece to his book--a painting by Moritz Oppenheim--Moses Mendelssohn ""was usually pictured walking or talking with his Jewish and Christian friends."" (10) Ludwig Geigher, at the end of the 19th, reflected on the literary salons that had existed in Berlin almost a century earlier, imagining that those friendships were solid and durable. (10-11). Cite is Ludwig Geiger, *Geschichte der Juden in Berlin* (Berlin, 1871), p. 107.&nbsp; After the 1880s, there were breaks in these friendships that some Jews had believed to be sturdy, he cites his own *Nationalism and Sexuality*, ch. IV. <br />&gt; ![picture](http://im.glogster.com/media/4/33/16/35/33163536.jpg ""Moses Mendelssohn discussant avec Gotthold Ephraim lessing (1860)"")<br /><br />* What happened though utlimately was that *Bildung*'s purpose for the bourgeoisie had less to do with the universal ideal. That is utlimately he writtes *Bildung* served two purposes: 1) it ""legitiimzied the middl class compared to the upper and lower classes..."" (11) and 2) it helped create a ""boutrgeois elite which, as Humboldt intended, would provie better civil servants for the Prussian state."" (11) <br /><br />* What happened to *Bildung* then was that it was ""detached"" from the ideal of autonomous individuality.&nbsp; This is really key!! And MOsse has a lovely sentence that carries a lot of interpretive power here: ""With the passage of time, *Bildung* itself, like its aesthetic component, became detached from the individual and his struggle for self-culvation and was transformed into a kind of religion--the worship of the true, the good, and the beautiful."" (11) This sentence is powerful. His reference to the shift vv the aesthetic is that the aesthetic was attached more to these strands of emotional enthusiasm, what he had described before as an aesthetics that satisfied emotinoal needs and which was not, as originally in *Bildung* and the Greek ideal of beauty, a support of rationality and self-discipline. VV *Biludng* in general what he means is that the the ideal as a kind of ""religion"" served more as a ""means of bilding bourgeois materialism..."" (11, bottom). <br /><br />* In taking up the idealistic side of *Bildung*, Jews had been ""chasing a noble illusion"" he thinks. (12). He notes that from the beginning in Germany ""nationailsm had come to the resuce in order to reinforce cohesion of society against the onslaught of modernity."" (12) He references a spin fichte had put on the defintiion of *Bildung* that had again appeared in Friedriuch Paulsen's *Das Deutsche Bilungswesen* (1912) that treated the concept as ""a means of reshaping reality through the power of ideas"" and Fichte had added that these ""ideas"" were tied to German character. Jews then ""seem scaracely to have realized that both borugeois society and the peopel themselves needed more tangible signposts in order to make the abstract concrete."" (12) What a great sentence!!! He mentions Bloch's statements about the ened of ""daydreams"" to efforts to change the world. <br /><br />* Indeed, in the end it was not jsut ""tangible signsposts"" that were needed in Germany, but forms of discipline that could actually be used to keep ""control over public and private life."" (12) So that in the end somehow ""[d]iscipline and conformity...took precedence over self-cultivation and spontaneity of citizenship."" (12) He ntoes that in the *Volkschule*, where most Germans received their edcuation, *Bildung* had always been about discipline and conformity. And this was increainsly the case. The ideal of *Bildung* that ""should have been opten to all"" was increasingly ""controlledd by a self-perpetuating elite."" (12) And this system utlimately was very effective in creating an elite who viewed hemselves as the ""conscience of the nation."" Germany was so succesful at this that it became a model for the world. But he suspects more than being a ""conscience"" they were in the end ""guardians of the existing order."" (13) <br /><br />* At this point the cult of friendship definietly declined, and Fichte's idea set out during the French occupation of Prussia--that ""man could not love hismelf or anything outside himself unless ideas rooted in the German characer were part of the system of belief--became more common coin. He cites his Mosse, ""Friendship and Nationhood: About the Promise and Fulfillment of German Nationalsim,"" *Journal of Contemporary History* 17 (April, 1982): 358. (13-14) <br /><br />* The erosion of the *Bildung* ideal he note happened gradually, and gained steam particularly after World War I. (14) Even after the rise of antisemetism in the 1880s, Jews struck to the ideal of *Bildung*. <br /><br />* He refers to Lessing's *Nathan der Weise* as the ""Magna Charta of German Jewry...""

(15) <br /><br />* As Germans turned away from the classical ideal of Bildung, treating it in a narrower and narrow mode, Jews were increasingly exluded from the mandarin class. Some tried therefore to try to join the German working class ""but once they had done so, they were often singled out as troublesmoe intellectuals who refused to do their duty as foot soliders in the workers' movement."" (19) Others he said tried to continue int heir role as intelelctuals and ""exorcise the irrational by examinig it rationally and dissecting it in the rational mind.""

How To Make Our Ideas Clear,"<p>Notes</p>
<p>* Section I goes through a critique of the rationalist logical notions of descartes and Leibniz...then moves to the ncessity of ""making our ideas clear.""</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>* Referring to the first paper in the series ie ""Fixation of Belief,"" Peirce reiterate the principle of the ""irritation of doubt"": ""thea ction of thought is excited by the irritation of doubt, and ceases when belief is attained; so that the production of belief is the sole function of thought."" (132)</p>
<p>* He goes through a more detailed examiantion of the processes leading to belief on 133-134, using the&nbsp; metaphor of music.&nbsp; He tries to thereby distinguish to ""elements of consciousness.""&nbsp; The tone itself which ""may be prolonged for an hour or a day, and it exists as perfectly in each seocnd of that time as in the whole taken together; so that, as long as it is soundmking, it might be present to as esne from which everything in the past was as copletely absent as the future itself."" (133)&nbsp; Then there is the ""air""--and this makes little sense--because he's talkign about ""perceiving it"" -- perceving the air??&nbsp; Does he mean the individual sound as it is carried by theair.&nbsp; He does say ""We certainly only perceive the air by hearing the separate ntoes; yet we cannot be said to direclty hear it, for we hear only what is present at that instant."" (133-4)&nbsp; In any case, the poitn is that to perceive it we need a ""continuity of consciousness which makes every lapse of a time present to us."" (133)&nbsp; The point iseems to be that we are immediately consciousnes of the tone and only <em>mediately</em> conscious of the air, and this he says holds for all consciousness.&nbsp; (134)&nbsp; Sensations are ""completely present at every instant""&nbsp; whereas other elmenemts (like thoguth) have ""beginning, middle, and and, and consist in a congruence in the sucession of sensations which flow throught the mind."" (134)&nbsp; Reaching back to his metaphor: ""Though is a thread of melody running through the succession of our sensations."" (134)&nbsp;</p>
<p>[ Is this rationalist or empiricist?&nbsp; It sounds more empiricist to me...and that makes sense.&nbsp; But is it empiricist really?&nbsp; It sounds somehow like Locke--sensations are tied to gether in the mind trhough reflection?... But is&nbsp; it?]</p>
<p>* Now thoguht produces belief and what is belief?&nbsp; It has three properties: 1) it's something we are aware of; 2) it ""appeases the irritation of doubt."" 3) ""it involves the establishment in our nature of a rule of action, or, say for short, a <em>habit</em>."" (134-5)&nbsp; <strong>So thought produces belief which is habit.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>*&nbsp; And more importantly, if two diuffrent beliefs produce the same rule of action, then they aren't really distinct.&nbsp; (135)&nbsp; This is now getting into the idea of distinction -- ie to replace the kind of distinction that Descartes and Leibniz used -- that is ""practical.""&nbsp; So ""what a think means is simply what habits it involves."" (137)&nbsp; To distinguish between two ideas that have the same habit results is wrong for him.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>""Thus we come down to what is tangible and practical, as the root of every real distinction of thought, no matter how subitle it may be; and there is no distinction of meaning so fine as to consist in anything but a possible difference of practice.""</strong> (137)</p>"

The Dainty and the Hungry Man: Literature and Anthropology in the Work of Edward Sapir,"<p>p.058-65  Sapir's Poetic and Literary Theory Writings</p>
<p>Handler now goes into Sapir poetry.  He notes a sense of alienation and helplessness on 58-59.  Back on 55 he notes that this feeling of helplessness and iscontent had also been provoked by WWI, which had also affected him by causing a loss of funding (here he cites Murray's article on ""Edward Sapir's Canadian 'Winter'"", p.65)</p>
<p>Handle'rs description of Sapir through his poetry: ""Self-doubt and a feeling of being at oddes iwth one's true self are implies in several blunt, sarcastic pieces aimed at academicians.  The metaphysician is a dog chasing his tail, the philosopher constructs daily a new system to epxlin the universe.  'Professors in War-Time' chides those who stand aloof, refusing to apply their wisdom and skill 'while all the world is soaked in blood and groans with pain.'"" (59)</p>
<p>He cites at length a poem ""Helpless Revolt"":</p>
<p>I hve no respect for what is.</p>
<p>I can not mend and patch,</p>
<p>I can not bend my soul to the twist</p>
<p>That will make it fit with the brutal fact,</p>

<p>Key idea though is in ""Dainty versus Hengry Man"".  These two ideals of a person.  The Dainty Man is an aesthete and desires the beauty of form; Hungry Man desires the ""crassness of life."" Hungry Man, though, does not want a ""meaningless asemblage"" (H's words), but also the ""inner truths of the heart.""  [Note: Basically, the former is the liberal; the fomrer the romantic... ] (59-60)</p>
<p>The next key part comes in Sapir's two writingson writing ""Twilight of Rhyme"" and ""REalism in Prose Fiction"". (61)</p>
<p>First establishes principle that niether the Dainty Man's interest in general form nor the Hungry Man's interest in the ""crassnesss of life"" are sufficeient unto themselves. (60-62)</p>
<p>In the second, Sapir establishes a method of a ""profound and all embracing realistic art"" that satisifes both the desires of the Hungry Man for the knowledge of ""individual hearts and collective life."" (H's words, 63)</p>
<p>This is th eline that H follows: the desire to conceptualize the whole, but without losing sight of the ""individual hearts."" He next moves to Sapir's critique of the superorganic.  He sees a parellel between Sair's rjeection of a ""superorganic level of reality that coerces individuals and nullifies their creative possibilities..."" (64) with Sapir's desire not to lose sight of the individual while conceiving a whole.</p>

Bildung,"<p>&nbsp;General Notes 2/2013</p>
<p><br /><br />* Bildung seems to have a special meaning in relation to enlighenment (aufklärung) in Germany. The author says a parallel exists in relation to the difference between Zivilisation and Kultur in Germany, as the authors of the G.B. have noted in another essay. (508-509)<br /><br />* In 1784, the term -- when the quote by Mendelssohn that starts the essay was written -- the term was not new, but it had taken on a new application, namely it had bedcome a key term in an intellectual discussion among people who say themselves as writers and well read. In every day language it was not often used. and when it was it was used to refer either to the development of the eucatiuonal system (ie institutions) or to education as a kind of social status. But this was enough to allow the word to enter into political language, so that Bildung is seen as the most important process in the creation of equal conditions... (509)<br /><br />* This is super interesting...the heart of taste...this can bear directly on Boas' rue formulation. Herzensbildung. Is he reversing it? The taste of heart? (515)<br /><br />* So the link between bildung and nationalization created a notion of political Bildung, but this meaning was still scattered in the late18th...(515)<br /><br />* With the enlightenment thinking Bildung takes on more weight than Erziehung... It was used especially with reference to forming or shaping (Formung), the self improvement of the human soul's capacities (Seelenkräfte), taste or herzen.(515) <br /><br />* Herder's take on Bildung. It is an independent concept such that he can speak of he spirit of education. It is independent like other words, Kultur, Geist, Humanität. And he understood it as a natural and universal process that like destiny,...<br /><br />* The increased attention to Bildung is not the reasonw that Education was more and more important. There was at this Time a ""comprehensive change in the Image of humans"". (517)<br /><br />* With Goethe's understanding over Herders, a certain Genius is attributed to the well educated. But a genius that also involved a relentless self consciousness about self cultivation and pedagogy. (518) <br /><br />* The tension or discrepancy between the new humanist classical Bildungskonzept and the bürgerliche ""Stands- und Berufsbildung"" concept as the utilitarian absolutist state envisioned it led to conflicts of priority. 519)<br /><br />* Amazing quote, shows in particular that Herzensbildung was part of this classical humanist conception somehow.<br /><br />* The French Revolution introduces a new suspicion of the Bildugsideal, as something inherently revolutionary... (522)<br /><br />* The suspicion of Bildung then became a part of the battle over political mentalities and the debate over educational policy. But at the same time the intellectual elite and liberals felt compelled to argue that ""true"" Bildung was hindering the revolution because it created a reform mentality among both the governed and thebgoverning. They believed that this reform disposition was a source of progress, but they believed it led to not on Y the valuing of Bildung but also of the observation of reform practice of enlightened absolutism. When one focuse only on Bildung as leading to te unfolding of human capacities in the individual, only a minority of the educated could affirm the political revolution as inevitable. (523) In the end this leads to an identification of Bildnung with Ordnung, that Goethe was understood as the chief witness of... (523)<br /><br />* Here is what the author calls an anti revolutionary concept of political Bildung. Which be comes characteristic of Gebildeten. (524)<br /><br />* Fichte's take on Bildung as the way for the German nation to establish itself, but only as a form of Bildung that erased class distinctions, that was truly universal.<br /><br />* The idea of Menschendbildung developed as a reaction to the idea of Bildung as an intellectual and impractical thing. It emerged in accounts that determined the meaning of Bildung in a detailed manner in relation to aetheics, military life, literature, etc...<br /><br />* It was the neohumanist idea that set the tone of the pedagogical discussion in the first part of he 19th. This ideal reconciled the idea of Bildung as a individual unfolding no related to any profession or practical concern ,by reserving that part I it for the adolescent and young adult years. After that point it was work with the goal of making the individual useful to society. (529)<br /><br />* Prussia was the state in which the Bildung ideal was most leading, for example at Humboldt. (530)<br /><br />* There was then also a reaction against Bildung. There was a sense for example that what was called Bildung was not, that it was too high, did not include the lower classes, and was really just a matter of style, and a form of corruption. True conservatives imagined that echte Bildung would create a feeling for order, law, and security... (531)<br /><br />* This section is important because it explains how the educated classes bult into Bildung their own interests as a class, and how that then also integrated them into a process of state and constitutional reform then taking place. Through them and through the neohumanist idea of Bildung the process of constitutional reform was linked to a process of the inner human development linked o the human sciences. (531-4)<br /><br />* Hegel they say defined the inner relationship between Geist and Bildung, racially through one's building of oneself in the image of a profession in the Geisteswissenschaften... (535)<br /><br />* The tight linkage btw Bildung and the Geisteswissenschaften is evident in the fact that the implementation of a newly dynamic and historical blanket concept of Bildung was a requirement for the development of the Geisteswissenschaften in Germany. Hegel and Humboldt were key here. (536)<br /><br />&amp; In the Vormärz period the awareness of the way Bildung was conditioned by state and social relations became more pronounced. It was commonly accepted that the constitutional state should not just guarantee property rights but also the right to education. Key to this relationship was the linking of political maturity and the cultivation of people. This then involved the question of equality because thelack of Bildung among the lower classes was understood as a danger if the lower classes were also given the vote. (542)<br /><br />* The social meaning of Bildung developed in this period such that the concept became tightly related to the concept of property ownership. Bildung became a kind of verification of property ownership and in a way that served the interests of the educated middle class It became self evident that someone with Bildungbwas not poor. Many viewed the meeting of poverty and cultivation as unhealthy and the conservatives viewed it dangerous. That was linked to a concern that too much studying and too little productivity would lead to more pauperism and ultimately to radicalism. (543)<br /><br />* This idea of Bildung as linked to freedom, equality, and order was also a way of making critical demands with respect to the present. Either to make clear that the progress of the constitutional politics depended on the education of the property owning and well educated classes, or to say that only through the development of constitutional politics could broad education and political education be demanded. The concept of political Bildung became especially important in the 1830s. There was a sense in this period that did not last among those who expressed it that the provincialism of the Germans supplied a basis for the rapid development of the capacity for political Bildung. What is Political Bildung? It is the idea of linking diversity through a critical awareness? The article quotes the Staats-lexicon from 1839 which put it this way: ""der Begriff der politischen Bildung fasse eine on tausend Farbe erscheinende bunte Mannigfaltigkeit in eine zusammen und sei gleichbedeutend mit dem Idee des Volkes."" That is the signified the idea of summarizing a great and emerging diversity into one and was thus linked to the idea of the volk... (543)<br /><br />* Here there were two ways of thinking about Bildung. It could be thought to refer to social equilibration or redistribution (sozial ausgleichende) or to in reverse contribute to greater sozial differentiation. The authors to through some fears of how Bildung would create fundamental differences. Hegel pointed this out. J. G. Hoffman for example divided the national citizenry into groups based on work and education level and was afraid that among the educated working middle class an abstract relationship to work could lead to a kind of intellectual darkness and apathy, anarchism, etc... The authors see in this kind of warning a certain high minded perspective that suggested a tendeny toward social exclusivity. On the other hand, others such as C. Welcker divided the state intothose who had studied and those who had not. In this line, August Von Struve, the 1848 radical democrat, noted that only the rich could get access to education and as a radical democrat laid out the principle of universal free education for all people as a basic right. (544)<br /><br />* This discussion about expanding access to education to more people as not new, but in the 30s it took on a stronger cautionary tone. Here Struve again was forceful. (545)<br /><br />* Conservatives both Christian and ""organic"" liberals opposed radical democratic calls for universal education on the basis that it was unnatural. Rohmer 1844 put it that the radicals thought that Kultur and Bildung could replace nature. More Rohmer thought that volksunterrichts would lead to the destruction of their inherent power (Volkskraft) and to their coming under the influenzier of the Maß Zeitgeist. (545)<br /><br />* Interesting that if one thinks about the notion of character this was way more<br /><br />* In the late 18th and 19th centuries, the Bildung ideal became central to the self understanding of the German educated classes. In this sense, education was a form of spiritual commodity that marked the difference between the properties and the unpropertied. And in this sense, the meaning of Bildung had more to do with belonging and not belonging to the group of well educated than it did with the actual content of education. An 1864 book entitled ""The education and the Educated"" put this in terms of a need for education to be based on forms that could are the basis of a general humanity and that could then create an ideal type, but this required subordinating or finding a happy medium between a general ethical pattern and the freedom of individual personality. These ideas formed the basis of a critique of more humanist notions of education, and ultimately led to a more tense attempt in some even more humanist texts to conform/constrain education to a practical social domain. (547-548) * More detail please!!!<br /><br />* The authors account of a kulturkritik of Bildung by Nietzsche and Lagarde, that in their description seemed to pick up on the idea that Bildung hadnjust become a sign of membership in the Gebildeten, and that education just supported an uncritical notion at the educated German was in every possible way the representative of German culture. Nietzsche thus suggested a concentration and narrowing of Bildung as well as an increased emphasis on the self-sufficiency I'd education. In Lagarde's case a similar critique led to the suggestion of a stronger nationalistic education for the elite, whereas the general population should be satisfied with A very basic education. (549-550) <br /><br />* Lagarde's critique led through other critiques of reason and thus to a focus on the strengthening of the body to national socialism and thus the Bildungsbegriff has come into question, and so also leads often to an agreement with the neohumanist idea of Bildung. But the concept has also been challenged by the concrete changes, for example population increase, specialization in professions, wider access to education, as well as as a result of the emergence of new sciences such as anthropology, psychology, pedagogy, etc...</p>"
"From Experts to Social Scientists: The American Anthropologists, 1929-1963","p. 005- 8  Theoretical Basis and Argument

This thesis focuses on the interaction between institutional and disciplinary features of twentieht-century anthropology in the United States.  His interest,
drawing on Foucault, is to look at the way anthropology excluded and included certain forms of inquiry over time.  (5)  He follows Foucault to be senseitive to ""clusters of 'statements', or ideas...'discursive formations.'"" (6).

He also draws upon Kuhn's paradigm idea as well.  He notes that Kuhn's concept implied an ""interpersonal element"" within the community of scientists.  (6)  He writes that ""In the postwar years, the anthropologists' desire for pradigms and desire to emulate the ideal of the 'scientist' came to be the motifs that bound together forms of anthropological knowledge and divided anthropological knowledge."" (6) 

The thesis notes a substantive change in the anthropology before and after WWII.  Madden thinks that anthropology was, using Kuhn's phrase, ""pre-paradigmatic"" prior to WWII in that no single theory ""was a model with which anthropologists could explain cultural processes or organize cultural research definitively."" (7) 

After WWII he thinks they changed up.  ""Anthropologists tried to organize facts in hierarchical fashion according to various models.  'Schools of thought' formed around these attempts to establish models, and for some schools of anthropologists, pardigms did emerge with which anthropologists organized anthropological research.  Other anthropologists, particularly the linguistic anthropologists and the symbolic anthropologists, were unable to formulate models despite their best efforts...."" (7-8)"
Critique of the Power of Judgement,"<p>Kant's Definition of Culture</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This definition is in a section 83 ""On the ultimate end of nature as a teleological system"":</p>
<p>*&nbsp; He starts with the idea that he says he has developed up until this point in the text that ""we have sufficient cause to judge the human being not merely, like any organized being, as a natural end, but also as the<strong> </strong>ultimate end of nature here on earth, in relation to which all other natural things constitute a system of ends in accordance with fundamental principles of reason...""&nbsp; (297).&nbsp; I can't follow this exactly at this stage not having read the book up until this point, but he is saying then that humans are the ultimate end of nature and that all things are organized such as to create a system of ends supporting the human.</p>
<p>*&nbsp; Then he says ok if we are going to pinpoint ""that which is to be promoted as an end"" in human's connection to nature as the ultimate end <em>in the human, </em>then that thing ""must be"" something that ""can be satisfied by the beneficience of nature itself"", ie what nature itself provides??, or it is ""the aptitude and skill for all sorts of ends for which he [the human?] can use nature (external and internal)."", ie the ways humans can take advantage of nature, build on it?&nbsp; (second nature? culture?)&nbsp; He then says that the first and second end of nature are ""the happiness"" and ""the culture of the human being."" (297)</p>
<p>* Happiness he defines as ""a mere idea"" (as opposed to something ""abstracted from his instincts and thus derived from the animality in himself"") of a ""state"" in which ""he would make his instincts adequate under merely empirical conditions (which is impossible)."" (297)&nbsp; Nature he says does not make happiness its end, even if human beings are nature's ultimate end.&nbsp; Nature he says has not protected humans and more than any other beings from ""its destructive effects"" AND he says humans themselves possess ""natural predispositions"" that also works against his own happeiness int he fro of ""plagues that he invents for himself""--ie war, opression, etc.&nbsp; (298)&nbsp; SO: this means that even if nature had set human happiness as its end ""that end would not be attained in a system mof nature upon the earth, because the nature inside of us is not receptive to that."" (298) So he says that what this means is that humans are, even thought they are the ultiamte end of nature, ""always only a link in the change of natural ends"".&nbsp; As ""the sole being on earth who has reason"" he says that when nature is seen as a teleological system, it is human's ""vocation to be the ultimate end of nature"" (298), but ""always only conditionally, that is subject to the conditiont hat he [the human] has the understanding and the will to give to nature and to himself a relation to an end that can be sufficient for itself independently of nature, which can thus be a final end, which, however, must not be sought in nature at all."" (298)&nbsp; Ie the condition of humankinds vocation as the ultiamte end of nature is that they recognize that the securing of their own happiness is not nature's goal/end.&nbsp; So as the ultimate end of nature, it is human kinds' job/duty? to realize to set himself and nature in a relationship that produces a final end that is ""sufficient for itself independently of nature""--but that end is not happines, which is a mere idea a he said at the outset. <strong>Perhaps this can be reduced to the idea that as the ultimate end of nature (that is as the sole beings with reason) humans must themselves develop a relationship to nature that will allow them to pursue an end which must be ""sufficient for itself"", ie we cannot expect it to be something secured for us by nature.&nbsp; We must support it.</strong></p>
<p>* So then to find where in the human is the ""ultimate end of n ature"" we must think about what nature does in us that prepares us to do what we must do ""in order to be a final end.""&nbsp; He says that we have to separate then those ends whose possibility depends on conditions that nature establishes, from those things that humans themselves msut do.&nbsp; <strong>""Earthly happiness"" is one of those ends that can only be produced from conditoins establishe by nature, an end that is only possible ""through nature inside and outside of the human being.""&nbsp; So humans cannot make it their end, and if they did this would prvent them from ""setting a final end"" for their own existence.</strong>&nbsp; All that is left, Kant says, among humans' ""ends in nature"" is ""the formal, subjective condition, namely the aptitude for setting himself ends at all and...using nature as a means appropriate to the maxims of his free ends in general, as that which nature can accomplish with a view to the final end that lies outside of it and which can therefore be regarded as its ultimate end."" (298-299)&nbsp; So by the end that humans uniquely can establish as ""sufficient by itself"" is also nature's ""ultimate end"" even though it ""lies outside of it"".&nbsp; <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>* This is where culture comes in: ""The production of the aptitude of a rational being for any ends in general (thus those of his freedom) is culture."" (299) Ie culture is what produces in humans the ability or capacity to develop pursue ends that humans' freedom allow them to define.So ""only culture can be the ultimat end that one has cause to ascribe to nature in regard to the human species..."" (299) -- ie human happiness is not the utlimate end of nature nor is the idea that humans should be the ""foremost instrument of establishin gorder and consensus in irrational nature outside him."" (299)&nbsp; <br /></strong></p>
<p>*&nbsp; But he says not all kinds of culture are ""adequate for this ultimate end in nature.""&nbsp; (299)&nbsp; He says the ""culture of skill"" --by which he refers to cultures of certain skills that allow humans to use nature for their own ends?--is not enough because it is not ""sufficient for promoting the will in the determination and choice of its ends"" and this is essential ""for an aptitude for ends."" (299)&nbsp; <strong>What is needed he says is a kind of culture, which he terms the ""culture of training (discipline),"" that is ""negative, and consists in the liberation of the will from the despotism of desires, by which we are made, attached as we are to certain things of nature, incapable of choosing for ourselves, while we turn into fetters the drives that nature has given us merely for guidance in order not to neglect o reven injure the determination of the animality in us, while yet we are fre enought ot tighten or lossen them, to lengthen or shorten them, as the ends of reason require."" (299)</strong></p>
<p>*&nbsp; He says that the culture of skill cannot be easily developed without inequality among humans.&nbsp; The ""majority"" he says provides the ""necessities of life"" to the mintority wh produce the less necessary parts of culture, ie science and art.&nbsp; But this situation as it develops on both sides produces ""calamities"" on both sides he says: on the side of the majority because of the violence imposed, and onthe side of the rich ""because of dissatisfaction from within"" (299)&nbsp; All this, though, he says is ""bound up with the development of nature itself, even if it is not <em>our</em> end.."" (299)&nbsp; But <em>our </em>end, which is the utlimate end of nature, is only attained in ""that constitution&nbsp; in the relations of human beings with one another in which the abuses of reciprocally conflicting freedom is opposed by lawful power in a whole, which is called <strong>civil society</strong>...""&nbsp; (299-300)&nbsp; !!!!&nbsp; Ie there is this whole within which the infringement of one person's freedom o n another's is ""opposed"" by a ""lawful power""....&nbsp;</p>
<p>*&nbsp; But he says for a civil society to exist there msut be--""even if humans were clever enough to discover it and wise enough to subject themselves willingly to its coercion""--a ""cosmpolitan whole"" by which&nbsp; he means a ""system of all states that are at risk of detrimentally affecting each other..."" (300)&nbsp; Without this, he says, war will occur and ""is inevitable"" esp because of ambition, love of power, and greed ""on the part of those who are in power..."" (300)&nbsp; And he reflects that it may be possible to imagine that war ""is a deeply hidden by perhaps intentional effort of supreme wisdom if not to establish then at least to prepare the way for lawfulness together with the freedom of the states and by means of that the unity of a morally grounded system of them..."" (300) And war also, he says, is ""one more incentive...for developing to their highest degree all the talenta that serve for culture."" (300)</p>"
Difference to  Sameness: Gender Ideology in Sexual Science,"** Summarial Note **

This article examines the interconnections between gender ideology (specifically, sexologist's shifting statements about sexual sameness
v. difference in man and women) and the broader social context as
sexologists sought professional legitimation and authority. 

They note that it was only with Kinsey that sexologists began to reverse
the typically Victorian claim about the physiological and sexual difference
of men and women -- a difference that sexologists like Havelock Ellis 
perpetuated.  The emphasis on sameness was pursued futher by Masters & 
Johnson.

The most useful part of this article is Irvin's analysis of the weaknesses of 
sexologists' claims about sexual sameness rooted in the purely physiological
level at which sexologists asserted sameness.  Irvine writes: ""This sexual essentialism not only locates the totality of sexual expression in the body, but equates sexuality with physiological process.  Modern sexual scientists have simply inverted Ellis' logic that different sexual anatomy should give rise to a separate and unequal social structure.  Now, instead, whatever is physiologically similar is considered the same and therefore equal.  Misunderstandings or anger between men and women should vanish once they understand that their bodies responsd similarly to orgasm; homophobia will cease once heterosxuals recognize that gay people arenot physiologically different.""  (21)  In other words, the sexologists' argument perpetuated Victorian and Darwinisitic links between sex difference and social structure, and as a result it also failed to account for the persistence of conflicts that were perpetauted on a social level...they ignored ""gender"" in other words.   (See 19-22 for analysis of the weakness of sexologists' claims for equality.)

She does not make this point but opens it up:  that these claims for inequality were thus weak, because they could not very well resist the arguments of those who insisted that the self, after all, should not be rooted in sexuality.

Antiromantic Romanticism: Sapir's Critique of American Individualism,"<p>p.075-83 Linking Sapir to Arnold &amp; Bourne re Desire for ""Genuine Culture""</p>
<p>In this section, H links Sapir with critiques by both Arnold &amp; Bourne to a desire for a ""Genuine Culture.""</p>
<p>He starts with letter about Bourne published in the <em>Dial</em> after Bourne's death that is very praiseworthy and holds Bourne up as an ideal type.  He had the ""will to see things as they are"" as well as the ""warmth of idealism"" [Hungry and Dainty Man combined?] but this ""haunts"" Sapir.  I.e. this iss not all about warm feelings.  It makes me think of his description of the individual with the will to stand outside of received ideas that he describes i nhis review of Jung's types.  Also noteworthy praise of Bourne's occasional ""bitterness"" which Sapir says ""was in reality but the ken edige of a remorseless sincerity and that  he would have been as eager to cut and change his own soul with it as anyone else's."" (76)  This image of cutting into one's soul come up again...</p>
<p>H note that Bouren has been resusciated as a ""forgotten prophet"" and a ""cultural radical"" of this ttime, cites Casey Balke's work as well as two books by Vaughan (1997) and Clayton (1984).</p>
<p>For this generation of radicals he cites May culture was important.  Here he is citing May's <em>The End of American Innocence</em>, but also Hegeman (1999) and Manganaro (2002).It was important in the sense that there was a ""culture championed by the American patricians and intelletuals, and aspired to by the middle classes,"" which was ""elitist an, evolutionary, unitary, and European."" (76)  It was Arnold's def'n of culture, H says.</p>
<p>Now he picks up the point Manganaro makes also: that while Arnold's culture seems the opposite of Boas' relativistic version, this was not the case.  He cites the Stocking point that ""concern for integration and holism made Arnold's notion of culture closer in some respects to the modern anthropological notion than was that of Arnold's concempaory, E.B. Tylor. "" (76-77)  He then suggests that Bourne's geneartion was gripped by ""naitonalistic quest for an American culture distinct from European culture."" (77) That was the case atthe same moment that European culture seemed to be destroying itself in WWI and so this was about separating off Americna culture, which was developing arund the th epower of its industry in part.... nationalists felt that Ameican culture might be moving in a different adirection.  ""Thus, in addition to conentoinal elitist notions of cultural standareds, discussions of culture in the teens and twneties could draw on a naitonalistic (and ultimatley romantic) conception of culturla plurality, if not on anthropological relativism."" (77)</p>
<p>[Notes: Some of this above seems off: to suggest to much similarity between Arnold and Bourne seems dangerous.  Naitonalism was part of this, but also wasn't there really somethign deeper going on related to the apparent destruction of Euroepean humanism?]</p>
<p>Now he goes through Bourne's critique of Arnold.  in essays published in the New Republic, Atlantic Monthly and the Dial.  Bourne critiques an uncritical reception of Arnold in ""Our Cultural Humility.""  (78) He critiques Arnold for being vaue about culture.  Says it appeals to Americans because it is ""quantitative"" and ""democratic"" and critiques the American ""acquisitive"" attitude toward culoture.  In ""Cult of the Best"" Bourne also goes after the division between a Lowbrow and highbrow, where culture is ""reserved only for the few."" (79)</p>
<p>H notes a similarity of Bourne's rhetoric to Sapir's in Culture, Genuine and Spurious which was finished he thinks based on letters to Lowie in 1918, a time when he says ""Sapir would regularly have read Bourne."" (79)</p>
<p>He starts to go through Culture, Genuine and Spurious again on 79.  He picks  up the themes of 1) harmony - ""unified and consistent attitude toward life""; 2) :nothing to do with efficiency or technical progress""; 3) theme where individual is not irrelevant to culture.  (79-80)</p>
<p>Here H beings to emphasize that ""cutlural goals or rends are not to be mechanically  imposed upon the members of a culture"".."" (80)</p>
<p>[Note: H gets close to the bureaucratization them that I want to empahsize at this point, but does not go straight for it.  ]</p>
<p>H ssays he does not know if Sapir took the term ""genuine culture"" from Bourne, but says it seems likely. He also says they are simialr b/c they express a ""mild sympathy"" at this stage in 1918.</p>
<p>Now H moves onto linking Sapir with Arnold, which I think s more probelmatic.  This is an argument that Manganaro makes too, that there is a consistent tradition of cultural thinking here betwteen Bourne, Arnold, etc...all rooted in the idea of culture as order posited against disorder/anarchy (see notes on Manganaro in Zotero).</p>
<p>The similarities that H sees are: 1) Focus on a true culture as ""internal"", though he notes they use the word differnetly.  But for both it refesrs to spiritiual accomplishments.  [Is that enough?]; Opposition to civilization, as external and mechanical.  He compares Arnold and Sapir's disdain for mecanical organizational industrial achievements.  2) Both see ""culture as  astimulus to creativity and a challenge to unthinking routine."" (81) Again they are settig this against differnet things--Arnold Protestant work ethic; Sapir priggish high-cultural snobishness.  3) ""notion of harmonious development"" (81) Here he has a harder time because Arnold's harmonious devleopment is in the develpment of traditional high culture whereas Sapir's is ""sociological"".  (81)</p>
<p>Again on 82 he is forced to note the differences between them, esp. since Arnold would not have been able to hold up a primitive tribe as an ideal of genuine culture the way Sapir does!! He also notes the two idioms in which character/personality are reversed in terms of being good things.  (82)</p>
<p>Nonetheless he makes thesame argment that Manganaro does: ""these differneces should not lead us to overlook the fact that Sapir , Bourne, and Arnold particpatedin a shared discourse heavily influence dby romantic thought.  Liek the romantics in general, all three sought a way to recover genuine culture in the post-Enlightenment world of rationality, antitradition, and industiral democracy."" (83)</p>
<p>He also attributes to Sapir and Bourne a moment of optimism in circa 1918 that quickly fades. He quotes the last paragraph of Sapir's essay when Sapir predictes that genuine cultures ""will grace our lives"".  [Note: Ithink that here he has missed the fact that these comments re genuine culture are made in context of prediciton of the dissolution ofthe modern political state and the rise of an international order, which will allow culotures to adhere to regioal locals, smaller, better suited to hte individual see 329-331 in Culture, Genuine and Spurious in Mandelbaum collection]</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Locke was born on September 3, 1885 to Pliny Locke and Mary Hawkins Locke.  Pliny was a ""man of some note"" (5).  He was connected to Liberia as his parent's had been missionaries there and had ""particapted in the training and education of the indigenous black population before th country's independence in 1947."" (3) His father, IshamAfter el, had been a freeborn black person and a teacher at the African American school in Salem, NJ beginning in 1843.  The school had been organized by the Coloured SChool Assocation of Friends.  Ishmael allegedly attended Cambridge University, but there is no proof.  Ishmale met his wife in Liberia, Mathilda Saunders, who was born of a black mother and a white father of GErman origin.</p>
<p>Pliny graduated from the Institute for Colored Youth in Philadelphia and hoped to teach math.  But he volunteered in a Reconstruction school.  and then after decided to enter Howard University Law School, graduating in 1874 at the top of his class.  He gave a speech at the end of his law school on ""Equity"" an in it ""he discussed the millenial possiblity of a reign of justice and reason, themese that he would pass down to his son."" (6)  After law school he worked for a man named GEner Oliver O. Howard as a personal secretary, but then could not continue in the job because he refused to give up smoking.  He then joined the civil service in 1876 and taugh tschool for years, becoming a principal in a school in Chester, Penn.  In 1883, he was appointed by the REpublican Administration to be a supervisor in the Philadelphia Post Office with a salary of $600/annually. He was the first black person to hold the job.  Then he married Mary Hawkins after a lengthy engagement.  Eventually he became an inspector in the Civil Service Commission, but then in 1890 he was again teachin gschool.  The authors write: ""His career, oscillating between a restricted range of civil service jobs and the 'profession' of a pulic schoolteacher, epitmoizes the economic and social opportunities available to African Americans in this relatively liberal Northern city."" (7)</p>
<p>Locke's mom was also an educator.  Mary Hawkins' mother was also involved in setting up school in Liberia.  Mary Hawkins wa s a devoted teacher and took great pride in teaching.  ""[E]steem for education permeated the atmosphere in the Lockes' Philadelphia home. This pride was transmitted to their son as a sense of -privilege, or at least a feeling that race and skin color were ultimately irrelevant, or should be, when set against one's ability to learn and teach any manner of subject.""  (7)  Mary Hawkins became ultimately devoted to Felix Adler's Ethical Culture movement, ""which virutally made a religion of education.""

The Cosmopolitan Imagination: Franz Boas and the Development of American Anthropology,"<p>Notes 3/2012:</p>
<p>Going through Part I that covers Boas' early life</p>
<p>Ch.1</p>
<p>Intro:</p>
<p>* L says Boas was influenced by liberalism of 1848 which she describes as inovling an ideal to ""liberate the individual from the social and personal constraints imposed by tradition."" (19) And also the German notion of Bildung ""as a model of individual cultivation."" (15)&nbsp; (see 15-17)&nbsp; She also develops a thesis, using some ideas by F. Jameson about how late nineteenth century bourgeoisie had internalized in the family structure the conflicting values that constitued liberalsim, that Boas was seeing himself in the light of conflicting ideals represented by his parents: his mother representing ""political engagement, science, idealism, and a source of freedom""; , and his father representing ""liberalism, amorphous politics, religious heritage and, eslewhere, practicality material concerns, and authority.""&nbsp; (21)</p>
<p>* Notes that Boas did not seem to have a ""positive religious identification"" with Judaism and was instead ""motivated by anti-semetism and the forced, negative identity it generated."" (23)</p>
<p>Building the story of him:</p>
<p>* Nature important to him in his youth.&nbsp; MOther encourages the children to explore nature, to heighten their powers of observation.&nbsp; He took himself seriously as a ""scientist"" very early on.&nbsp; This involved an interest in ""our immediate environmemtn"" as he wrote in the <em>Curriculum Vitae</em> he was forced to write when leaving Gymnaasium in 1876-77 (that is inthe archives).&nbsp; This interest in nature involved an interest in geography in its focus not onpolitics but on physical history, and in geography, mineroalogy, astronomy etc.&nbsp; An interest in the physical environment.&nbsp; and alrady an interest in for instance geographical distribution.&nbsp; Liss notes he made a map of ""the geographical distributionn of lichen and mosses near Minden."" (26)&nbsp; Later he picks up an interest in the ""comparative"" approach to nature and science.&nbsp; He writes in his CV that all these books about nature:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>had the disadvantage of teaching me to&nbsp; pay attention to details only, while they awoke no understanding at all for nature in&nbsp; general.&nbsp; this may also ahve been due to the fact that I was too young then to be able to ahave an eye for more than details, an aiblity whin in any case I lacked for along time.&nbsp; Also the fact tha at the time I gathered together an herbarium of vairous kinds of moss hsows how much I was accustomed to pay attention only to details.&nbsp; Perhaps, however, it shows also that I possessed the inclingation to compare isolated things with each other. (quoted on 27)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So then he takes up an interest in ""natural history"" -- which Liss defines as ""the itnerraltion of things and their structures."" (27)&nbsp; Then Boas writes that ""True science...does not consist in describing single plants but in the knowledge of their structure and life in the comparison of all classes of plants with one another."" (28)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* At the point that Boas makes this shift, a shift that he sees as a shift and dividing line in his life.&nbsp; Liss narrates this bys aying that ""science became a source of identity and an escape from turmoil which neither religious affiliation nor the demands of academic success coudl provide."" (29)</p>
<p>* Now she goes into his relationship to religious heritage.&nbsp; Their family was Liss writes Jewish ""more for reasons of tradition and family loyalty than faith."" (29) Boas father Meier kept the family religious--and Boas's sister Franziska recalled that Boas was raised as orthodox roginally--it was doen mostly optu of respect for his reliugiuos mother.&nbsp;&nbsp; So they received religious education even thought their family were ""free thinkers.""&nbsp; Boas, Liss writes, ""saw this combination as a blance between emotional attachment and intellect: 'My parents had broken throught ehs hackles of dogma,' he wrote.&nbsp; 'My father had retained abn emotional affection for the cedremonial of his parental home without allow it to influence his intellectual freedom.'"" (29-30)&nbsp;&nbsp; But Boas also ""found religious experimentation important."" (30)&nbsp; He and his sister Toni discussed mysiticism and prayed together and punished each themselves for sinning.&nbsp; (30) Liss writes that Boas ""felt that his lack of religious education made it difficult to understand th power of religious belief for others and blamed his upbrining for the shock of finding that a friend ahered to the 'authority of tradition.'"" (30)&nbsp; And he criticized his ""free thinking"" mother for ""being ignorant of his own spiritual questioning."" (30) Here Liss makes an odd turn in her interpretation, stating that Boas ""scientific interests helped reconcile these tensions"" between religious belief and free thinking.&nbsp; (30)&nbsp; In the page that follows, she quotes Boas' letter to his wife about their kids' curiousity about God, and what Boas does there is refer to a kind of general transcendental absolute the awareness of whcih can be comforting--and this was the kind of idealism that was on offer at the time, and to which William James critiques in, I think, The Will to Believe.&nbsp; But I don't see here science medaiting a tension.&nbsp; (see 30-31)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chapter 7:</p>
<p>This chapter is key because it is where Liss makes the central points of her thesis, ie 1) that Boas's cosmopolitanism temporaraily intertwined with the interests and the cosmpolitanism of NY elites, 2) that this unity failed because of the divergence of these two forms of cosmpolitanism, ie Boas was interested in science as a means to transcend truth and the NY elites were interested in cosmopolitanism as social ideology of local justification as she calls it, and 3) that cosmpolitanism as a set of ideas focused on the transcendence of particularity could not confront directly the issues of power and local domination with which it was intertwined.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First she shows how Boas used his studies to emphasize interconnectedneess, ie her sense of ""Anthropology as a Cosmopolitan Project,"" 315-336.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then a key part is her account of how Boas gets placed in NY.&nbsp; Here she is showing Boas appealing to NY elite cosmopolitanisms and she ends that section 336-348 with a witty metaphor:""...Boas'coming to New York gathered the threads of cosmopolitanism but the knot was much harder to tie."" (348)&nbsp;</p>
<p>She explains the trouble that Boas faces in an important section on Boas' conflict with Jessup, Bumbus and ultimately Osborn at the American Natural History Museum.&nbsp; Here is wheree the divergence emerges because Bumpus and Jessup find Boas' mode of organization inaccessible to the lay person. Here is where Liss makes her key argument about cosmpolitanism when she writes:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">As explicit as thse differences were [ie the conception of the right mode of organization and what anthropological science should be like], Boas fought in 1905 in the more abstract name of science, authority, and independence.&nbsp; Although to an extent these were masks for the ideological battle which was a stake, it was typical of the cosmopolitan discourse that higher ends, ostensibly not tied to the issues of power or irreconcilably different views, should be the explicit issue. ( 356)</p>
<p>But I think Liss sort of reveals the weakness of her critique of cosmopolitanism and indeed her conception of it vv Boas in this quote.&nbsp; Because immediately what is at issue here is precisely power and not simply cosmopolitanism but in fact as she puts it ""science, authority, and,"" especially, ""independence.""&nbsp; A few sentences later she refers to the factthat what was going on was that Bumpus was exerting ""artbitrary authority over Boas' legitimate authority and individualism.""&nbsp; <strong>So she is right that power is very much at issue here but if cosmopolitanism is what is being deployed here it is not cosmpolitanism as she has defined it as as an apolitical focus on the ""transcendence of particulars"" through scientific knowledge.&nbsp; It is being enlisted to combat the authority of local elites, and that is not insignificant.&nbsp; By the end of this same paragraph it is even more extreme beecause she quotes Boas writing to Osborn on 6 May 1905 that Bumpus had: ""undermined the 'absolute control' and discipline Boas needed 'by constantly countermanding my orders' and running 'the Museum as a military organization, in which the fifrst purpose is subordination...'""!!!! &nbsp; Anti-Militarism!!!!</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Key also to Liss's critique is that Boas' cosmpolitanism&nbsp; and that which he sahred with NY elites was utopian in that it was abstract, ie she says it ""relied on an abstract and formal resolution of tensions between locallism and universalism and of difference as if the ocnflicts were essentially problems of communication.""

<p>Sklansky gives his account of social change toward modern corporations on 206-207.  It fits with what I understood.  INterestingly, he does not site the Visible Hand.  The other thing I noted is that he said prior to the rise of corporations, which he said had its roots in state ""charters"" given during the Early Republic, ""the prevailing form of business organization in the postbellum period remained the family firm or partnership, owned and operated by its founding entrepreneurs, mainly financed internally from its own profits, engaged in speciazlied production for a local or regional market.""

"The Averaged American: Surveys, Citizens, and the Making of a Mass Public","p. 037-39  Transmission of Culture Idea to Lynds

Igo points out explains how the Lynds decided to pick up the anthropological perspective in the process of trying to understand how to treat the mass of non-qualitative data they had gathered in an objective fashion.  I.e. how to ""look at the life of a city objectively."" (quoted on 37).  Lynd said "" I hit on the idea of trying to do what an anthropologist w'd do if he studied an Amer. community."" 

Igo emphasizes that the Lynds did not pick up the specific theories that were around at the time i.e. the American ""culturalist"" one or the British functional one.  She writes: ""...with no training in the field, what Lynd really mean by this was a loose collection of tools and a framework, 'some kind of scheme for throwing familiar things into less immediate, more universal categories.'"" (37)  
She then argues, however, that he picked up a few specific tools.  
One of these was the participant-observation method or as he had phrased it the idea of the ""naive observer.""  (This was common to both).  She notes that they though they qualified as outsiders even though Helen was from Illinois and Rovert from Indiana because they had a New Yorker's perspective, but they also thought a Chinese anthropologists would have been ideal.  

The second thing they picked up was more functionalist and came from W.H.R. Rivers and A.R. Radcliffe Brown.  This was the idea of ""fundamental human activities"" (or basically the functionalist idea that every society is basically organized in order to solve fundamental functional and economic problems) such that as the Lynds wrote ""Whether in an Arunta village in Central Australia or in our own seemingly intricate instituitonal life of corporations, dividends, coming-out parties, praryer meetings, freshmen, and Congress...huaman behavior appears to consist in variations upon a few major lines of human activity."" (quoted on 38)
Most generally, however, Igo notes that they picked up the anthropological trope of making the familiar exotic, or more soberly stated looking objectively at the patterns of behavior in modern life just as in ""primitive.""  They wrote: ""To many of us who might be quite willing to discuss dispassionately the quaintly patterned ways of behaving that make up the customs of uncivilized peoples, it is distinctly distasteful to turn with equal candor to the life of which we are a local ornament.  Yet nothing can be more enlighteneing than to gain precisely that degree of objectivity and perspective with which we view 'savage' peoples."" (38)

Igo notes that the people who sponsored th eproject at the Institute for Social and Religious Research (see 30 about this) thought the anthropological approach a gimmick and a distraction, but the Lynds meant it seriously.  (38-39)"
Women in Early American Anthropology,"p. 035 - 39   Women's Anthropological Society

Women, mainly due to efforts of Matilda Stevenson, started their own anthropological society in 1885, which lasted for fourteen years.  it's goals were stated in the ""the Organization and Constituion of the Women's Anthropological Society"" printed in Washington, D.C. in 1885.  O-L analyzes it in detail.  (35-37)  It had as its goal to bring women into science and to encourage their cooperation in the ""development of science"" (35-36).  She notes that they ""did not imagine themselves as innovators in anthropology, but as contributors of special information which would enrich a defined discipline.  They appeared willing to tackle almost anyting but they emphasized the special work they could do as women.""  (36)  O-L concludes also that they had ""clearly accepted their role as women"" (37) and that conflicts between career and marriage would only come later. (37)  Their was a charity dimension to their work and they even invovleved themselves at one point in helping to fund low-rent housing in Washington.  (39)  At a joint meeting with the Anthropological Society, Zelia Nuttall presented a paper on ""The Mexican Calednar system"" Nuttall was presented by Alice fletcher, the president of the women's group, theat meetin was April 9, 1895.

"The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, The Revised 1920 Edition","<p># General Notes on Max Weber, **The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism**, trans. Stephen Kalberg (Oxford, 20011), 4/2013:</p>
<p>##Ch. 1: ""Religious Affiliation and Social Stratification""</p>
<p>* He starts out with the question why is it that so many protestants are in positions in which they own the means of production, i.e. are employers or capitalists, are more highly skilled etc.? He then notes that this dominance of protestantism is strange, given that the rejection of religious authority is so dominant. Why then have the middle classes (buergerlichen Mittelklassen) allowed this ""Puritan tyranny"" and even developed a heroic justification of it? (67-69)</p>
<p>* The explanation is not he says is not the economic one: that Protestatns tended to own more cpital, etc... (69)</p>
<p>* The answer -- the ""causal relationship"" -- he says is ""undoubtedly one in which a learned inner quality decides a person's choice of occupation and futher course of occupational development."" (70)&nbsp; -- So here he brings in a cultural explanation.</p>
<p>* Then he pushes this further saying that in the case of Protestants this ""inner qualty"" has created a ""specific tendency toward economic rationalism..."" (71)</p>
<p>* This same quality is not presetn in Catholics as he discusses in great detail. (70-72)</p>
<p>* That said, he dismisses the shallow contrast between Catholic's ""alleged"" Weltfremdheit and the materialism of Protestants. He notes that really there may be an ""inner affinity"" between ""estrangement from the world, ascetism, and church-based piety on the one hand, and the <em></em>earning of one's living under capitalism on the other... "" (72) I.e. he notices that many of the most pious ffigures ""came from business-oriented social circles."" (73) But then in fact where Calvinism has occured, he notes, there is a surprising linking of piety and busness sense, that is there are many cases in which ""a capitalist's virtuoso business sense combines in the same person, and group of persons, with the most intense forms of piety that pentetrate and order that bleiever's entire life."" (73) And this has been historically the case he notes where Calivinism has occured. i.e. monks and industrialists were high percentage of those prosletized into the Huguenot churches in France...other examples here on 73-74.</p>
<p>* Given this the link between Protestnatism and capitlaism cannot come from the allged materialism of Protestants, their so-called enjoyment of life's pleasures...rather this ""inner affinity"" must come from their piety. He notes that Montesqueiu saw the English success in commerce as related to their piety. Is this the link, he asks? If so, he says, we must ""attempt to penetrate the characteristic qualities and distinctiveness of the great religious worlds of thought given to us historically in the diverse forms of Christianity."" (75)</p>
<p>* But first, he says, he needs to specific the ""phenomenon"" (i.e. capitalism?) for which he wants to ""offer an historical explanation..."" (75)</p>
<p>## Ch. 2: The ""Spirit"" of Capitalism</p>
<p>* The chapter begins the effor to specific the phenomenon. He points out that the nature of this ""spirit of capitalism"" cannot be stated simply, but nevertheless he will provide a ""provisional illustration"" to get things started. (76-77)</p>
<p>* The way in which he sets up this object ""the spirit of capitalism"" is also expalined vv a methodology that he quickly relates on 77. Basically he takes what appears to be a historical approach. The researcher has a particular point of view; that point of view must be identified; and it is not the only one that is possible; the piont then is not to ""trap reality in abstract, general concepts"" but to form ""historical concepts"" that ""order reality into tangible, causal connections"" but which are themselves ""unique in character..."" (77)</p>
<p>* In his provisional illustratino of the concept, it is Franklin that stands as the basis for this ""spirit."" He quotes him at length on 77-78. What he finds here is the idea of ""the duty of the individual to increase his wealth..."" (79) This duty then becoes an ""ethically oriented maxim for the organization of life"" which is specific to ""modern capitalism."" (79)</p>
<p>* This notion of ""duty"" which he says is not at all ""self-evident"" is in fact the ""characteristic of the 'social ethic' of modern capitalist culture."" (81) <br />Here we get some of the first language about a ""casing"" (or cage?):</p>
<p>&gt; ...the capitalist economic order of today is a vast cosmos into which a person is born. It simply exists, to each person, as a factually unalterable casing (<em>unabaenderliches Gehaeuse</em>) in which he or she must live. To the extent that people are interwoven into the context of capitalism's market forces, the norms of its economic action are forced onto them. Every factory owner who operates in the long term against these norms will inevitably be eliminated from the economy. With the same degree of inevitabilty, every worker who cannot or will not adapt to the norms of the marketplace will become unemployed."" (81)</p>
<p>* This then is a form of socialization carried out by ""economic selection"": ""through a process of economic selection, the capitalism that today dominates economic life socializes and creates the economic functionaries that it needs, both owners of businesses and workers."" (81)</p>
<p>* Again, the spirit in question here is duty and not merely greed or self-agrandizement. In fact, capitailsm he makes clear has no use for pure greed, or auri sacra fames [the lust for gold.]: ""[Modern] capitalism has as little use for *liberum arbitrium* [easygoing] persons as laborers as it has for the businessman fully without scruples in the running of his company, as we have already learned from Franklin."" (83) Modern capitalism then is linked with duty and with ""a rational use of capital in a managed manner and a systematic capitalist organization of work became the domiannt forces determining the orientation of economic activity."" (84)</p>
<p>## Ch. 3: Luther's Conception of the Calling</p>
<p>* The chapter tracks Luther's ideas about the calling, up through Calvinism. The point is that the notion of the calling was itself a historical thing, ie. he's doing a kind of intellectual history here. The ""present-day meaning of the term derives from *Bible translations*--indeed *not* from the spirit of the original but from the spirit of the translators."" (99) He even notes later on 107 -- when explaining that the link between practical daily life and religious work that was the result of Calvinist thought came about merely as a consequence of the reilgious though of such thinekrs as George Fox (Quakers), or John Wesley (Methodists), etc... -- that his study might be seen as a ""contribution to the illumination of the way in which 'ideas' become generally effective in history."" (107)</p>
<p>* He traces Luther's thought on the subject, and then points out that Luther's conception of the calling ""remained tied to economic traditionalism."" (104) What he means is that the idea of the calling that Luther laid out understood the calling -- that is in terms of the work that a given person is tasked with in life -- as a ""special command of God"" so that wherever an individual is located in the ""objective historical order"" the work they are doing is the result of the manifestation of God's will and thus they are obligated to perform it. They must therefore ""stay"" in this calling. Luther develops this view in particular after the peasent uprisings of 1524-25. So his economic traditionalism -- here that means the sense that one should work, but not work in order to achieve one's own economic gain -- is at first rooted in a ""Pauline indifference to the world"" but then is anchored in his&nbsp; increasing sense ""Divine Providence that identified an unconditional obediance to God."" (104)</p>
<p>* The point is then that Luther did not make the link in his understanding of the calling beteween ""practical life and religious belief"", this link was made by other sects, and in particular Calvinism. Weber cites a passage from Milton's *Paradise Lost* to illustrate the way this link sounded, see 105-106, calling it also a ""Puritan turning-to-the world."" One finds this same point inn Pocock too. I noted it in my grad school exams for DR.</p>
<p>## Ch. 4 The Religious Foundations of This-Worldly Ascestism</p>
<p>* Weber uses ""Puritanism"" to refere generally to the ""ascetic movement"" in Protestanism -- for instance that was opposed to Anglicanism -- that is ascetic Protestantism. (114) Across these movmements -- he counts four: Calvinism, Pietism, Methodism, and what he calls the Baptizing Sects&nbsp; -- he finds ""identical manifestations of the moral organization of life"", including ""similar ethical maxims"" and ""highly influential literary devices employed in the organized care of the soul"" ... (114)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* He notes that one could here focus on the ""moral practices"" of these groups, and disregard their ""dogmatic foundations."" But this would not be wise. Ascetic morality he says was originally linked to dogmas the ""next life."" And these ideas of the ""next life"" he ays ""absolutely dominated people's religious thinking at that time. The moral awakening, which considerably influenced the practical life of believers, would not have been set in motion without the overarching power held by the next life over the believer."" (115)&nbsp; However, Weber is after something more specific than the practical significance, he wants to ""ascertain which psychological motivations gave direction to the organization of the believer's life and held the individual firmly to it."" (115) But to understand these pscyhological motivations -- to understand the degree to which ""[p]eople at the time brooded over seemingly abstract dogmas"" (115) -- is only understandable when examining the ""connection of these dogmas with practical-religious interests."" (115)</p>
<p>* He now looks at these main carriers listed above:</p>
<p>1) Calvinism</p>
<p>* Main doctrine is the doctrine of predestination. This was also prevalent in Luther's thought, but declined in importance, whereas in Calvinism it became more important.&nbsp; The point of this doctrine was u ltimately to promote a profound isolation of individuals from each other. ""...the mood of a generation that devoted itself to the randiose consistency of the doctrine of predestination, its melancholy inhumanity must have had one result above all: a feeling of unimaginable inner loneliness of the solitary individual. The question of eternal salvation constituted people's primary life concern during the Reformation epoch, yet they were directed to pursue their life's journey in solitude. Moreover, the destiny they would encounter at journey's end has been unalterably set for them since eternity. And no one could help them."" (119)</p>
<p>* This doctrine coincided with the ""absolute disappearance of all aids to salvation through the church and the sacraments..."" (120) Here is the famous disenchantment thesis I think, because Weber then says that this was part of an ""overarching process in the history of religion -- the elimination of magic from the world's occurences (Entzauberung der Welt)..."" which in the doctrine of predestination found ""its final stage..."" (121)</p>
<p>* Psychologically, the consequences of this elimination the sacramental confession removed a ""mechanism...that had provided regular 'release' of an emotion-laden consciousness of guilt..."" (121) The result was that the ""interaction of the Calvinist with his God too place in a deep spiritual isolation."" (121) He cites John Bunyan's book Pilgrim's Progress as an esample of this mindset.</p>
<p>* But how did this impact the way in which Calvinism produced a certain orientation to social organization? Here Weber points out that although it would seem paradoxical that a social idea that produced absolute isolation would produce a ""superior"" form of social organization. (I think he means superior here ironically?? ) It has to do with the new meaning that ""brotherly love"" was given. The thought goes as follows: The world exists to serve the Glory of God. So God wants the Christian to work in the community in order to serve the Glory of God. So then also the ""soical work"" that the Calvinist does is to serve God. ""It follows that work in a calling is also affected by this aim, and hence this-wordly work stands in service to the community as a whole."" (122) The result then is that brotherly love ""because it can only be in service to God's glory and not to fulfilly physical desires, is expressed primarily in the fulfillment of the tasks of a calling--tasks that are given by *lex naturae*. In the process, <strong>work in a calling becomes endowed with a peculiarly objective, impersonal character, one in the esrvice of the rational formation of the scoietal cosmos surrounding us."" </strong>(123)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Elaborating this further, Weber discusses how such a view could have been supported, i.e. the idea that one was either saved or damned. He traces two ideas both of which support the image he's starting to build about the way calling and work were put forward as an absolute obligation. First, ""it became a matter of duty pure and ismple for believers to consider themselves among the elect few and to repel every doubt about their state of grace as nothing more than temptations of the devil."" (125) To think otherwise meant inssuficient faith and a lack of God's grace. That is, Weber says, Calvin as opposed to Luther bred ""self-confident 'saints'. They were found often in those steel-hard (stahlharten) Puritan merchangts of capitalism's heroci epoch. Indeed, these 'saints' are occasionally found even today."" (125) Second, for those who were uncertain, work without rest was recommended as the best way to regain faith. (125)</p>
<p>[So you can really see here his iron cage being built...]</p>
<p>* He contrasts the whole issue of work's relation to salvation by contrasting it with the Catholic notion of good works -- and some Lutherans criticized Calvinism, saying that&nbsp; what was going on in it was just a (Catholic) doctrine of good works (128). But Weber points out that for the Catholic good works were not rationailzed into a whole system of work that reflected God's glory. The Catholic's good works were isolated acts carried out in specific situations. They were bound up with teh ""magic"" of the Priest and the sacrament and transubstantiation, and they provided the Catholic with a ""relief"" from the sense of guilt. But the elimination of the sacrament in Calvinism meant that the Calvinists was meant to ""live inserperable from this tension [between his own weakness and God's expectations]."" (129) So the Calvinist needed not merely good works, but an ""intensification of good works into a system."" (129) Weber notes that it is not mistake that the work ""methodism"" is attached to the ""carriers of the alast great reawakening of Puritan ideas in the eighteenth century, just as the term Precisians (which is substantively fully snonymous with Methodism) was used to refer to their [Dutch] seventeenth-century spiritual ancestors."" (129) The potin is that now the goal was a ""fundamental transformation o fthe meaning of one's entirely life -- in every hour and every action"" that had the goal of ""raising of believers out of the status naturae [natural state] and into the status gratieae [state of grace]... "" (129) The saint here had a transcendent goal, and that is exactly why it's ""this-wordly, pratical course was thoroughly rationalized and exclusively domionated by a single point-view: to increase god's glory on EArth. "" (129) Weber pushes this further, though, noting that this was understood to be achievable only through ""constant reflection"" so that with this new rationalized impulse that drove at an ""ethical organization of life"" the Puritan's took over Descartes' cogito ergo sum... (130)</p>
<p>* He notes that here there was also the basis of its ""inner affinity"" and ""contrast"" with CAtholicism. The ""inner affinity"" being that in order for this rationalization to be possible what had to be destroyed was teh ""instinct-driven enjoyment of life"" which was also a part of Catholic monasticism. But the contrast was that with the Reformation, whereas the monks insofar as they lived ascetic lives were separated from every-day life, now in the Reformation as the German mystic and popular aruthor Sebastian Frank saw it ""now every Christian must be a monk for an entirely lifetime."" (132)</p>
<p>* He brings back in Franklin here vv this methodocalism, and specifically Franklin's daily accounting of his moral failings in the tabular-statistical form. These offer a ""classic example"" Weber says of the extension of the ""systemization of a life organized around ethical principles..."" (134) He offers a short summation of this whole process that is worth quoting: ""As he monitored his own behavior, the later Puritan montioried also the behavior of God and discovered His finger in every single detail of life. Moreover, and in opposition to the teachings of Calvin himself, the Puritan knew why god had decied in htis way or taht way. hence the striving to make life holy and sanctified could almost assume the character of a business. A penetrating Christianization of the entire being was the consequence of this methodicalness now required for the leading of a life organized around ethical principles."" (134-5) Calvinism forced this on the believer in a way that Luthernaism did not he says. (135)</p>

"The Decline of the German Mandarins:  The German Academic Community, 1890-1933","<p>p.005-006  Book will focus on an ideal ""type"": the ""Mandarin""</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This derives from the referenc eto the Chinese elite.  He means by it ""simply...a socila an dcultural elite which owes its status primairly to educational qualifications, rather than to hereditary rights or wealth."" (5)</p>
<p>He understands the ""mandarin""as a social ""type"" also typical of what he seems to describe as a kind of ""stage"" (social historian? what's his relationship to Bielefeld school?).  ""They thrive between the primary ararian level of economic organization and  full industrialization.  At that intermediate stage, the ownership of significant amounts of liquid capital has not yet become either widespread or widely accepted as a qualifiaction for social status, and hereditary titles based on land holding, while still relevant, are no longer absolute prerequisites."" (7)</p>
<p>He then describes their whoel world view, noteably, in a very generalistic manner, without any evidence, as if this class of peole everywhere will always see things this way and udnerstand themselves in this way.  (7-9)  The base of it seems to be the principle that these mandarins understand their value as beig derived from their education which provides spiritual rewards and that from this base they then set about to increase the influence of themselves over the state and civil society.</p>
<p>What is strange abou thow he describes these mandarins in asuch a generla manner is that he started the whole section by suggesting that he thought that the German madarins represneted a ""special case"" because of the speed of industrialization in Germany (see bottom p.2)</p>
<p>Out of their attmepts to reinforce their own authority omes a certain idea of the state Ringer suggets: ""...mandarin intellectuals tend to develop a complex of thoeries to defend and to increase the elite's share in the management of the state, partly at the expense of the monarch.  Thus they launch a concerted attack upon 'arbitrary' goernment in the name of legality.  they inssist that governmet should no longer be considered a private affair between princes and aristocrats, nor the dominion the ruler's property.  To combat these notions, they create the idea of an abstract and raitonal state which 'runs itself' according ot fixed and logical principles and which stands above both rulers and ruled.  Thier inclination in this respect is natural, for it s they who will utlimately be in a position to interpret the reason and law of the state.  They supply an ever growing portion of the state officials, and the more rational and complicated adminstrative processes become, the more it is the mandarin bureaucrats who come to execute the abstract will of reasonable government in practice."" (9)</p>
<p>With respect to legality, he says they are interested in civil liberties, but not in popular participation.  For they are a minority he points out and ""[i]n a voting situation...they would carry little weight."" (10)</p>

Pragmatism's Conception of Truth,"<p>General Notes</p>
<p><strong>Truths themselves: </strong></p>
<p>* Starts out by saying that pragmatists and ""intellectualists"" share a common defintiion of truth as a property that ""means their 'agreement,' as falsity means their disagreement, with 'reality.'"" (112)</p>
<p>* The trouble comes in when one considers what is meant by ""agreement"" he says.&nbsp; The ""popular notion"" he says is to imagine that ""a true idea must copy its reality."" (113)&nbsp; But then he notes that that is rarely the case.&nbsp; Gives the example of a clock.&nbsp; If we imagine it then we can have a picture of a clock that is a copy of it in our heads.&nbsp; But then unless we are clockmakers we cannot have a copy of its inner workings.&nbsp; So a problem emerges on the empricial side.&nbsp; The idealist response he ntoes is to ""seem to say that they [our ideas] are true when they are what God means that we ought to think about that object.&nbsp; Others hold the copy-view all through, and spoeak as if our ideas possessed truth just in proportion as they approach to being copies of the Absolute's eternal way of thinking."" (113)</p>
<p>* The pragmatists sees in the solution of the empiricist and the idealist a common treatement of truth as ""essentially an inert static relation."" (113)&nbsp; Ie the idea that when you have a truth ""there an end of the matter.&nbsp; You're in possession; you <em>know</em>; you have fulfilled your thinking destiny.&nbsp; You are where you ought to e metnally; you have obeyed your categorial imperative; and niothing mroe need follow on that climax of your rational destiny.&nbsp; <strong>Epistemologically your are in a stable equilibrium.</strong>"" (113)</p>
<p>* The pragmatist asks the question which James says is standard (and which he also states in the chapter of Pragmatism ""What Pragmatism Means"") about ""what concrete difference will its being true making in anyone's actual life?"" (113)&nbsp; Or as he puts it also ""What, in short, is the truth's cash-value in experiential terms?"" (114)&nbsp; This reveals that ""<em>True ideas are those that we can assimilate, validate, corroborate and verify.&nbsp; False ideas are those that we cannot.</em>"" (114)&nbsp; That means that turth is not inherent; rather ""Truth <em>happens</em> to an idea.&nbsp; It <em>becomes </em>true, is <em>made</em> true by events.&nbsp; Its verity <em>is&nbsp; </em>in fact an event, a process: the process namely of its verifying itself, its veri-<em>fication</em>.&nbsp; Its validity is the process of its valid-<em>ation</em>."" (114)</p>
<p>* Ideas he says ""lead.""&nbsp; ""They lead us, namely, through the acts and other ideas which they instigate, into&nbsp; or up to, or towards, other parts of experience with which we feel all the while--such feeling being among our potentialities--that the original ideas remain in agreement."" (114)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* The point is in another way that ""The possession of truth, so far from being here an end in itself"" is only a preliminary means towards other vital satisfactions."" (115)</p>
<p>* So an idea that is true is one that produces a state of mind and ""the truth of a state of mind means this function of <em>a leading that is worth while.</em>"" (116) It is worthwhile if ""its leading to no frustration or contradiction."" (117)&nbsp; If so, then it is also verified.</p>
<p>* So truth is really about ""truth-processes"": ""They turn us <em>towards</em> direct verification; lead us inot the <em>surroundings</em> of the objects they evisage; and then, if everything runs on harmonoiously, we are so sure that verification is possible that we omit it, and are usually justified by all that happens."" (117)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Such truth processes are also social.&nbsp; He doesn't emphasize this enough I don't think, but it seems key.&nbsp; For instance, he says; ""Truth lives, in fact, for the most part on a credit system.&nbsp; Our thoughts and beliefs 'pass', so long as nothing challenges them, just as bank-notes pass so long as nobody refuses them.&nbsp;&nbsp; But this all points to direct face-to-face verifications somewhere, with-out which the fabric of truth collapses like a financial system with no cash-basis whatever.""&nbsp; Then here comes the social dimension: ""You accept my verification of one thing, I yours of another.&nbsp; We trade on each other's truth.&nbsp; But beliefs verified concretely by <em>somebody</em> are the post of the whole super-structure."" (117)&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Relations of ideas/truths: </strong></p>
<p>* Now James moves away from the ""matters of fact"" but to the ""relations"" among them.&nbsp; Because ""<em>Relations among purely mental ideas</em> form another sphere wehre true and false beliefs obtain, and here the beliefs are absolute, or unconditional."" (118) This seems to be the level of theory or principle or definition that he's alluding to ie when such relations are true he says ""they bear the name of either definitions or of principles."" (118)&nbsp; He gives some examples, liek that ""white differs less from gray than it does black..."" (118)&nbsp; or that 2 + 1= 3.&nbsp; The ideas is that these relationships become true in a unverified way? ""The objects here are mental objects.&nbsp; Their relations are perceptually obvious at a glance, and no sense-verification is necessary.&nbsp; Moreover, once true, always true, of those same mental objects."" (118) I'm wondering if this relates to the kind of ideas Peirce had on the relations between inductive, deductive, and abductive reasoning... for he says; ""It is but a case of ascertaining the kind, and then applying the law of its kind to the particular object.&nbsp; You are sure to get truth if you can but name the kind rightly, for your mental relations hold good of everything of that kind without exception."" (118)&nbsp;</p>
<p>*&nbsp; The sesnse is that we cosntruct these ideal and abstract theoretical structures.&nbsp; ""We relate one abstract idea with another, framing in the end great systems of logical and mathematical truth, under the respective terms of which the sensible facts of experience eventually arrange themselves, so that our eternal truths hold good of realities also."" (118) That sounds a bit like an idealist speaking, but James says here too in ""realm of mental relations, truth again is an affair of leading."" (118)&nbsp; There is a marriage of fact and theory james says that is ""endlessly fertile"" and this is not a process of ""special verification"" but something that is ""alrready true in advance of special verification, <em>if we have subusmed our objects rightly</em>."" (118)&nbsp; So that althouh these relational systems coerce us we are also coerced by the world of things, the ""sensible order""&nbsp; as well.&nbsp; So that there is a very tight fit between our theories and the world of objects that we ""subsume.""&nbsp; We cannot ""play fast and loose with these abstract relations...""&nbsp; (119) ""Between the coercsions of the sensible order and those of the ideal order, our mind is thus wedged tightly.&nbsp; Our ideas must agree with realities, be such realities concrete or abstract, be they facts or be they principles, under penalty of endless inconsistency and frustration."" (119)&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>And now what does ""agreement"" mean</strong>...</p>
<p>* So James thjinks that up until now the intellectualist and the pragmatist will largely agree.&nbsp; but the departure in these two viewpoints comes with the question of understanding what ""agreement"" between ideas and reality mean (that being the agreed def'n of truth.) (119)</p>
<p>* He defines agreement: ""To 'agree' in the widest sense with a reality, <em>can only mean to be guided either straight up to it or into its surroundings, or to be put into such working touch with it as to handle either it or somethign connected with it better than if we disagreed."" </em>(119)&nbsp; He adds usefully also that ""often agreement will only mean the engative fact that nothing contradictory from the quarter of that raelity comes to interfere with the way in which our ideas guide us elsewhere."" (120)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* So copying reality is important to something being true and ""agreeing"" with reality.&nbsp; But it&nbsp; is not the only essential part: ""The essential thing is the process of being guided.&nbsp; Any idea that helps us to <em>deal</em>, wehther practically or intellectually, with either the reality or its belongings, that doesn't entangle our progress in frustrations, that <em>fits</em>, in fact, and adapts our life to the reality's whole setting, will agree sufficiently to meet the requirement..."" (120)</p>
<p>*&nbsp; Here too the social dimension returns as being key: ""All human thinking gets discursified; we exchange ideas; we lend and borrow verifications, get them from one another by means of socail intercourse.&nbsp; All truth thus gets verbally built out, stored up, and made available for everyone."" (120)&nbsp; This leads to a kind of ethic: ""Hence, we must talk consistently justa s we must <em>think </em>consistently."" (120)</p>
<p>* In agreement again, ""leading"" is key.&nbsp; It's the leading that agreement rerpesents that engages the individuadl mind effectively and which also actualizes socia discourse: ""Agreement thus turns out to be an affair of leading--leading that is useful becasue it is into quarters that contain objects that are important.&nbsp; True ideas lead us into useful verbal and conceptual quarters as well as directly up to useful sensible termini.&nbsp; The lead us to consistency, stability, and flowing human intercourse.&nbsp; They lead away from excentricity and isolation, from foiled and barren thinking.&nbsp; The untrammeled flowing of the leading process, its general freedom from clash and contradiction, passes for its indirect verification; but all roads lead to Rome, and in the end and eventually, all true processes must lead to the fact of directly verifying sensible experiences <em>somewhere</em>, which somebody's ideas have copied.""

Metahistory: the Historical Imagination in Nineteenth-Century Europe,"<p>p.013  Notions of the Nature of Historical REality  White describes here four different approaches/paradigms (following Stephen Pepper's Worldy Hypotheses) regarding the nature of historical reality.  They are the Formist, Organicist, Mechanistic, and Contextualist.    <strong>Formist:</strong> - ""aims at the unique characteristics of objects inhabiting the historical field."" (14) - explanation complete when object accurately defined.  (14) - goal of explanation is to dispel sense of similarity between (unique) historical objects. (14) - found in Herder, Carylyle, Michelet and Niebuhr, Mommsen and Treveylyan.  (14) - Formism is ""dispersive"" not ""integrative"" (15)  <strong>Organicist:</strong> - integrative and reductive (15) - at its heart a ""metaphysical commitment to the paradigm of the microcosmic-macrocosmic relationship; and the Organicist historian will tend to be governed by the desire to see individual entities as components of processes which aggregate into wholes that are greater than, or qualitatively different from, the sum of their parts."" (15)  - typical of Ranke and ""nationalistic"" historians like von Sybel, Mommsen, Treitschke, Stubbs,Maitland.  (15) - narratives depict ""consolidation or crystallization"" (15) - they are interested in depicting ""integrative"" processess, hence their  works seem ""abstract"".

""Problem with Helmholtz and Lange: they maintained 1) that we can
infer the existence of things-in-themselves as the cause of our
sensations , and 2) that these inferences are justified by a
physiological propensity toward to "" structure our representations as
causes and effects. "" (2) the two undercut each other.because as a
result of 2, our inference vv causality and things-in-themselves  is
not justified, because is simply a result of our own physiognomy, not
the things-in-themselves. (2)""

Underline
""The source of the problem was Kant’s idea of things in themselves,
that is, objects considered independently of our experience of them.
Neo-Kantians like Lange and Hermann von Helmholtz wanted to maintain
that we can infer the existence of things in themselves as the causes
of our sensations, and thus as the explanation for why we have any
sensations at all. But at the same time, that inference was ruled out
by their view that our causal inferences are justified by a
physiologically conditioned instinct to structure our representations
as causes and effects. Lange, Helmholtz and others recognized this
incoherence in their views, and over the course of the 1860s and 1870s
attempted to articulate fully consistent accounts of things in
themselves. To varying degrees, they failed. 4 These Neo-Kantians’
problems with things in themselves were fully solved only by Ernst
Mach, in the context of the uncompromisingly austere theory of
knowledge he developed in the early 1880s, in his 1882 ‘The Economical
Nature of Physical Inquiry’ and his 1884 Contributions to the Analysis
of Sensations.""

Underline
""But Mach also articulated a coherent denial that things in themselves exist.""

PAGE 3:

Underline
""‘the world is our sensation’ (Mach 1898 [1882], 209).""

Note
""He will partly try to answer why Helmholtz and Lange persisted in
asserting the logical contradiction he explains before. (3)""

PAGE 4:

Underline
""Lange agreed with Kant that philosophy investigates knowledge by
investigating the subjective conditions that give rise to it. But he
also thought that investigation was a matter of empirical psychology.
Helmholtz and Lange argued that the physiology of the sense organs in
particular confirmed the broad outlines, while revising the details,
of Kant’s theory of knowledge.""

Underline
""Lange developed a philosophical account of knowledge that was
explicitly indebted to the physiological research of both Mu ̈ller and
Helmholtz.""

Underline
""Lange claims that the basis of causal inference is the ‘concept of
cause’. On his account, that concept turns out to be nothing but a
physiological disposition to structure our appearances as, for
example, following one another without exception, or so that one set
of appearances represents a causal mechanism and another set
represents the phenomena that mechanism produces. As he puts it,
‘[p]erhaps someday the basis of the idea of cause may be found in the
mechanism of reflex action and sympathetic excitation; we should then
have translated Kant’s pure reason into physiology . . . ’ (Lange
1866, 263/1873–5, 2:44/1925, 2:211).""

PAGE 5:

Underline
""For Mach, causal knowledge has authority for us precisely because it
is biologically primitive in this sense: we could no more choose not
to structure our representations causally than we could choose not to
digest food.""

Underline
""These accounts of the basis of causal inference have an important
consequence: they restrict the domain in which we can know causal
relations and, consequently, the domain in which causal inferences can
extend our knowledge. Lange understands this perfectly well. He
acknowledges that since the concept of cause is a disposition to
structure our appearances in certain ways, and since those appearances
are ultimately composed of sense- perceptions, we can know causal
relations only within experience. That is, the valid application of
the concept of cause is restricted to experience. Conversely, we
cannot know causal relations among things that exist beyond our
experience and are not the objects of any possible sense- perception.
These causal relations and inferences would have, Lange insists, ‘no
meaning’ for us (Lange 1866, 264/1873–5, 2:45/1925, 2:212). Thus, we
cannot claim to know causal relations between things in themselves.
Even causal relations between appearances and things in themselves
would extend beyond the limits of experience. Lange must thus deny
that we could ever claim to know that things in themselves cause
appearances. The same consequence follows for Mach: his account of
causal inference entails that we could never know that sensations are
caused by things in themselves.""

PAGE 6:

Underline
""Lange argues that our use of the concept of cause within the domain
of appearances necessarily leads to the idea of something beyond
appearances and so beyond experience, a world of things in
themselves.""

Underline
""Lange’s discussion of the distinction between nature and appearance
has the effect of introducing an additional component to his account
of the concept of cause: the idea that the concept imposes on us a
demand for explanations. For Lange, when we use the concept of cause,
we feel a demand for an explanation whenever we are faced with new
phenomena. We feel this demand ubiquitously (‘above all’ he says) in
the empirical world, because the demand, no less than the concept of
cause that produces it, is ‘conditioned by our organization’ (Lange
1866, 268). That is, Lange thinks that when we are presented with one
set of representations, we are physiologically disposed to take those
representations as phenomena that need an explanation, and then to
seek further representations that serve to explain the first set.""

Underline
""Lange thinks this physiological disposition ultimately furnishes us
with the idea of things in themselves.""

Underline
""we inevitably move beyond considering this or that particular
appearance and come to consider the totality of all our appearances as
a single set of representations.""

PAGE 7:

Underline
""But once we do that, the disposition to structure our representations
as phenomena and their physical causes leads us to conceive of the
totality of our appearances as something that needs an explanation.""

Underline
""This is the stronger of the two strains in Lange’s account of things
in themselves. It involves more than just the claim that the concept
of cause allows us to establish where the limits of our appearances
are.""

PAGE 8:

Underline
""But even if we cannot know anything else about things in themselves,
we can at least know that they exist. Thus on this strain of Lange’s
thinking, since the concept of cause disposes us physiologically to
conceive of things in themselves as things that would, if they
existed, explain our appearances’ existence, it ultimately entitles
him to claim that things in themselves exist.""

Underline
""This argument depends on an abductive inference: since things in
themselves would be the best (only?) explanation for our appearances’
existence, and since our appearances in fact exist, we may posit
things in themselves as the explanation for our appearances’
existence.""

Note
""Explanation of why Lange's account of cause as a proof that
things-in-themselves exist is a problem... (8)""

Underline
""However, in at least one sentence of Lange’s 1866 discussion of
things in themselves, he suggests a weaker strain of thinking that
avoids this problem.""

Note
""Weaker claim vv. Ausakity as proof of things in themselves avoids the
problem. (8)""

Underline
""But Lange says that things in themselves so conceived are ‘unknown’
to us (Lange 1866, 268). Thus while the concept of cause might, as a
physiological disposition, produce the concept of things in themselves
in us, the concept of things in themselves nevertheless remains a
concept ‘about which we do not know whether it has any significance
beyond our experience’ (Lange 1866, 268).""

PAGE 9:

Note
""In second edition, Lange does not solve the problem. (9)""

Underline
""The revisions have the effect of eliminating the stronger strain’s
inference that things in themselves exist from the second edition’s
version of ‘Kant and Materialism’.""

PAGE 10:

Underline
""Second, immediately following the paragraph from which he deletes his
earlier claim to know that things in themselves exist, he inserts this
passage: We do not, then, really know whether a thing in itself
exists. We know only that the logical application of our laws of
thought leads us to the notion of an entirely problematical something
that we assume as the cause of the appearances as soon as we have
recognized that our world can only be a world of representation.""

Underline
""However, while Lange eliminates any equivocation from the second
edition version of his Kant chapter, he decisively undermines those
efforts in ‘The Standpoint of the Ideal’, the final chapter of the
second edition of History of Materialism. Among other aims in ‘The
Standpoint of the Ideal’, Lange wants to distance his views from a
form of idealism (such as Fichte’s, or perhaps Hegel’s), according to
which our knowledge and the world that is its object are nothing but
products of our mind’s activity. To distinguish himself from this form
of idealism, Lange wants to maintain that there is a world that exists
independently of our selves and that the world presents us with facts
that are beyond our control. Thus in the final chapter of his book,
Lange once again finds himself facing the question of the existence of
things in themselves.""

PAGE 12:

Underline
""But here in the second edition he is far more clear, and he offers a
different account of the feature of our appearances that is at issue:
he is concerned with the relations between our appearances that are
not under the control of our will. However, besides that difference,
the argument from ‘The Standpoint of the Ideal’ differs from the
argument of the strong strain in the first edition only to the extent
that it clarifies and makes more explicit the form of the argument
that in the first edition Lange had left largely implicit. Lange now
says explicitly that a certain feature of our appearances furnishes us
with ‘evidence’ for the existence of things in themselves. But no less
than in the first edition, for Lange it is nothing but the concept of
cause that disposes us to regard a set of representations as demanding
an explanation, and then to seek an explanation that satisfies that
demand. Consequently, if we accept that things in themselves explain
certain relations between our appearances (e.g. the ones that are not
subject to our will), by Lange’s account we commit ourselves to the
view that things in themselves stand in a causal relation to those
relations between our appearances. That is, for Lange, we commit
ourselves to the claim that things in themselves cause those relations
between our appearances.""

Note
""So why is Langevso dependent in the idea that we can know that things
in themselves exist? (12)""

PAGE 13:

Underline
""For Lange, we come to have the concept of things in themselves,
because the concept of cause imposes on us a demand to explain certain
features of our appearances (e.g. their existence). We thus form the
concept of that which would, if it existed and we could know it,
explain that feature of our appearances. But at the same time, the
concept of cause entails that we could never claim to know the
explanatory relation between things in themselves and appearances.
That follows from Lange’s views that explanatory relations are (or are
a class of) causal relations and that the basis of our knowledge of
causal relations restricts that knowledge to causal relations within
experience. Lange’s account of the concept of cause thus imposes on us
a demand for explanations that outstrips the domain in which we can
have causal or explanatory knowledge. It imposes on us a demand for
explanations that we could satisfy only with causal knowledge we can
never have. Of course, it is possible to maintain unequivocally that
we can never have knowledge of the causal relation between things in
themselves and appearances, and thus that there are certain features
of our appearances that we can never explain. This is just what Lange
wants to maintain on his weaker strain. But while this view is
logically consistent, it is an unstable position in at least one clear
sense. The demand for explanations imposed on us by the concept of
cause does not entail that we must attempt to satisfy it, but it does
motivate such an attempt. It thus provides Lange with the motivation
to posit things in themselves as the explanation for certain features
of our appearances, and so to commit himself to an explanatory, and
thus for him causal, relation between things in themselves and
appearances. To be sure, there is no inconsistency in the idea that we
could face demands for explanations we could never satisfy. That might
well be our epistemic lot. But there is a tension in that idea that
helps explain why Lange never managed to eliminate from his
discussions of things in themselves the problematic claim that things
in themselves stand in a causal relation to appearances. Even if it
was possible for him to maintain his weaker strain unequivocally, as a
matter of fact he was unable to resist the motivation (he thinks) the
concept of cause provides to posit things in themselves as the
explanation for certain features of our appearances.""

Note
""Mach'a solution: he avoids the tension that Lange falls into because
he flatly says that things in themselves do not exist. (13)""

""the rough tactile elements we come to associate with bark, the bright
citrus odour we associate with pine and so on. That complex of
sensations is relatively stable: that is, most of the relations
between its constituent sensations are relatively constant. For Mach,
that constancy is partly a fact about relations between elements that
is independent of our efforts to organize our experience. But it is
also partly a function of our attending to certain relations between
elements and ignoring others, in order to organize our experience in a
way that serves our purposes. In any case, Mach thinks, we come to
regard that relatively stable complex as the representation of a body.
But strikingly, for Mach the body is nothing but this relatively
stable complex of sensation-like elements. Thus, for Mach, the world
does not consist of substances that exist independently of our
sensations and that cause our sensations by affecting us. Rather, as
he puts it, ‘the world is our sensation’ (Mach 1898 [1882], 209). 11""
and Note
""Mach's understanding of perception...""

Underline
""Mach thinks we make causal inferences because we are physiologically
disposed to structure our representations as causes and effects.
Further, Mach thinks that explanatory relations are essentially causal
relations. Thus for Mach no less than for Lange, if we commit
ourselves to explanatory relations between things in themselves and
sensations, we thereby commit ourselves to causal relations between
them.""

Highlight
""Mach does not maintain that we face a demand for explanations that
outstrips the causal knowledge that is available to us, and thus a
demand for explanations that we can never satisfy.""
and Note
""Like Lange does...""

PAGE 15:

Underline
""For Mach, discovering these relatively constant relations allows us
to marshal our experience in ‘economic and perspicuous’ order (Mach
1898 [1882], 210–1).""

PAGE 16:

Highlight
""Lange argued that the concept of cause furnishes us with the concept
of things in themselves, because it imposes on us a demand to explain
our appearances’ existence.""
and Note
""Anther good summary of Lange's position...""

Highlight
""But from Mach’s perspective, this is confused. For him, we need an
explanation only if our experience has in some way contradicted our
expectations of it. But what expectations could be contradicted by the
fact that we have any appearances at all? For Lange, appearances are
themselves elements that constitute our experience as a whole. Thus,
we could not have any experience without at the same time having
appearances and so could never have experiences that lead us to expect
an absence of appearances. So for Mach, in contrast with Lange, there
is simply nothing to explain about the fact that we have appearances.
Thus, Lange must be wrong that the concept of cause furnishes us with
the concept of things in themselves as the concept of that which
would, if they existed, explain our appearances’ existence.""
and Note
""And the contrast between Mach and Lange: for Mach appearances are
simply that stable organzation of elements of sensations. There s
nothing to explain and this no need for the concept if cause until
something diverges from our expectations about the origins of those
sensations. (16)""

PAGE 17:

Highlight
""However, for Mach even if we need to explain constant relations
between our appearances that are not subject to our wills, we do not
give that explanation by positing things in themselves. Rather, for
Mach we provide that explanation the same way we provide any
explanation – by discovering the relatively constant relations between
elements that let us bring our expectations into line with experience.
13""
and Note
""Interesting, so given that Mach denies that things in themselves
exist, how would he account for permanence in appearances, or the
persistence of appearances independent of our individual will? We
would so do. Y discovering the ""relatively constant relations""""

PAGE 18:

Highlight
""With luck we would discover the common features of the constant
relations that are subject to our wills and common features of those
that are not subject to our wills. We could then compare the common
features of these different relations, to discover how they differ. Of
course, these ‘common features’ are themselves just certain
higher-order similarity relations. So, our task would be to discover
the higher-order relations that let us distinguish which lower-order
relations are, and are not, subject to our wills. We could then begin
to predict which lower-order relations are subject to our wills and
which are not. In fact, for Mach we are already at least beginning to
attend to just these higher-order relations when we designate some
complexes of sensations as ‘bodies’ and others as ‘ego’. ‘Bodies’ are
just those complexes containing relations between their constituent
sensations that are (on the whole, if not absolutely) less subject to
our wills than many of the relations between constituent sensations in
the complex each of us calls ‘ego’.""
and Note
""The task would be to explain which sensations arevsubjectbto our
wills ans which are not. (18)""

Note
""Once the difference between these sensations has been established
there is no more to explain. Noting the contradiction, and then moving
from there to the idea that things in themselves exist as causes of
those sensations or appearances that are beyond our will, would be
just an overextension of our desire to posit causes, which has
psychological origins. (18)""

PAGE 19:

Highlight
""In a context where German-speaking philosophers were responding in a
variety of ways to a rapid accumulation of results in experimental
psychology and the physiology of the sense organs, Mach’s views of
knowledge from the 1880s are in certain central respects continuous
with the psychologistic epistemology that Back to Kant Neo-Kantians
sought to articulate over the course of the 1860s and 1870s.""
and Note
""The context for late 19th century neo Kantianism is this experimental
psychology. (19) also interesting that this might be the common link
to Tarde, where Tarde includes the psychological where Durkheim
excludes it. (19)""

PAGE 20:

Note
""Author suggests that Mach is in fact not a neo-Kantian because he
does not belive that things-in-themselves exist. (20)

And yet: ""But the Back to Kant figures never took their Kantianism to
consist in their (muddled) commitment to the existence of things in
themselves. Rather, they took their Neo-Kantianism to consist in
precisely the epistemological commitments they shared with Mach: the
views that the philosophical foundations of scientific knowledge must
be laid by investigating what Kant called the subjective conditions of
knowledge, and that empirical psychology and the physiology of the
sense organs provide us with the scientific means of carrying that
investigation out."" (20)""

Highlight
""Rather, Mach differs from the Neo-Kantians in his attitude towards
his own relation to Kant and to philosophy in general. Back to Kant
figures such as Lange and Helmholtz explicitly and emphatically
presented their psychologically and physiologically informed
epistemologies as confirming, revising and continuous with an
essentially Kantian philosophical project. They viewed empirical
psychology and physiology of the sense organs as a means of
reconciling natural science with a specifically Kantian vision of
philosophy (in contrast with the opposition between science and
philosophy they associated with Hegel). 15 In contrast, Mach shows
almost no interest in presenting his views as continuous with Kant’s.
In fact, Mach has no interest in presenting his views as philosophy.
In the preface to his Analysis of Sensations, Mach flatly denies being
a philosopher (Mach 1896 [1884], vii). He conceives of himself as a
scientist, and of his epistemology as a way of arranging science ‘in
economical order’ (1898 [1882], 197), justified not by abstract
philosophical argument (much less by appeals to philosophical
pedigree), but by its usefulness in, for example, providing a unified
foundation for physics and psychophysics.""

""Importantly, though, Mach did not see his thought as extending Kant's
philosophy. Lange and Helmholtz did. (20)""</pre>"
The Claims of Culture: Equality and Diversity in the Global Era,"<p>Notes July 2011</p>
<p>Preface</p>
<p>* She wants to critique a ""social dynamic"" in which ""global integration is proceeding alongside sociocultural disintegration, the resurgence of various separatisms, and international terrorism."" (viii)&nbsp; This has happened before--a&nbsp; reaction against ""economic, cutlural, and social homogenization"" by those who want to ""guard the autonomy of their waxs of life and value systems."" (viii) These contemporary movements have been identified under a series of phrases which she lists: ""struggles for recognition"" by Charles Taylor, Nancy Fraser, and Axel Honneth; ""identity/difference movements"" by Iris Young, William Connolly; and ""movements for cultural righst and multicultural citizenship"" by Will Kymlicka.&nbsp; (viii)&nbsp; B's position is that the presence of these movements--this ""strange multiplicity"" she calls it borrowing a phrase from James Tully--is that there has been a</p>
<blockquote>
<p>premature normativism in much contemporary political theory, that is, an all-too-quick reification of given group identities,a&nbsp; failure to interrogate the meaning of cultural identity, and a turning away from the sociological and historical literature on these topics, which are dominated by methodological 'constructivism.'&nbsp; This premature normativism has reuslted in hasty policy recommendations that run the risk of freeying existing group differences. (viii-ix)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She thinks this normativism-&gt;reification of culture is wrong headed because she belives that ""cultures are constitued through contested practices"" (viii).&nbsp; She does not believe in the ""purity of cultures, or even the possibility of identifying them as meaningfully discrete wholes.""&nbsp; She thinks of cultures as ""complex human practices of signification and representation, or organization and attribution, which are internally riven by conflicting dialogues with other cultures."" (ix) She also believes that in many cultures there is a ""degree of internal differentaiton"" that makes the dialogue with other(s) an internal process.&nbsp; Her preferred model is then a ""deliberative democratic model that permits maximum cultural contestation within the public sphere, in and through the institutions&nbsp; and assocaitons of civil society."" Thus there are ""certain kinds of legal pluralism"" that she believes to be consistent with deliberative democratic approaches.&nbsp; And in general she thinks that moral and political universalism is not necessarily incompatabile with ""democratic negotiation of certain forms of difference."" (xi)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* In this book, as opposed to <em>Situating the Self</em>, she is focusing on the problem of reconciling certain forms of moral and political universalism with a sensitivity to difference within deliberative democratic ideals...but the locus of difference are certain lifeways (ie cutlure) not gender. (xi)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Introduction on the Use and Abuse of Culture</p>
<p>* At the book's core is a critique of the culture concept as she thinks it has come into use.&nbsp; She gives a brief narrative of the concept's origin from p. 2-5.&nbsp; She uses the usual suspects: Kultur v. Civilization, drawing on Herder and so on, but also noting that the FRankfurt school emigres also apppplied it to mass society and that these ideas were introduced in the United States.&nbsp; Against this background however she notes that looking at contemporary discussion what she is struck by is the ""obsolence of the old, value-laden contrast between <em>Kultur</em> and <em>Zivilisation</em>.""&nbsp; Instead, she notes that what dominates is ""an egalitarian understanding of culture drawn from the social anthropology of Bronislaw Malinowski, Evans Pritchard, Margaret Mead, and Claude Levi-Strauss, who were critical of European cultural presumptions."" (3).&nbsp; She notes that their conception of cutlure is as an autonmous totality: ""the totality of social systems and practices of signification, representation, and symbolism that have an autonomous logic of their own, a logic separated from and not reducible to the intentions of those through whose actions and doings it emerges and is reproduced."" (3)&nbsp; What she sees here is that the conflict between civilization and culture is largely excluded from this discussion of culture, which she later calls the ""reductionist sociology of culture."" (4)&nbsp; The old civilization/Kultur conflict in the Frankfurt school created some concern about mass culture, but this is gone in these new works.&nbsp; That is, the binary conflict that made culture ""a term of critique in opposition to the concept of civilization"" is gone.(3)&nbsp; Instead, the notion of autonmous culture is linked to the notion of identity. (3)&nbsp; She sees this as an alliance between French structuralism and British social anthropology.</p>
<p>* Contemporary politics then fromher point of view is often a strange mixture of ""the anthropological view of democratic equality of all cultural forms of expression and the Romantic, Herderian emphasis on each form's irreducible uniqueness..."" (3)&nbsp; There is an assumption that everyone has some culture and that these cultures should be perpetuated.&nbsp; Conservatives draw on this idea to argue that peoples shuould be kept separate, and as with Huntington's clash of civilizations thesis, they imagine conflicts that ""closely follow cultural-identity rifts..."" (4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>* She quotes Terence Turner on the critique of the epistemological assumptions of this reductionist view of culture.&nbsp; The Turner article is ""Anthropology and Multiculturalism: What is Anthropology that Multiculturalists Should BE Mindful Of It?"" <em>Cultural Anthropology</em> 8 (no.4): 411-429.</p>
<p>* The point of all this though is to defeend what she calls ""social constructivism against attempts in normative political theory that reify cultural groups and their struggles for recognition."" (5) Social constructivism contains as she understands it includes a conception of culture that she describes from 5-11.&nbsp; Basically, her view rests on the experience of culture as one that is mediated by traditions of stories, rituals, symbols. tools and forms of material living that are shared, but most importantly are also contested.&nbsp; So that ""From within, a culture need not appear as a whole; rather, it forms a horizon that recedes each time on approaches it."" (5)&nbsp; Views of cultural wholes in&nbsp; her mind are the product of the ""social observer""--the 18th century chronicler, the 19th century ""general, linguist, or education reformer,"" the 20th century athrokpolgoist or secret agent and so on.&nbsp; (5)&nbsp; These people impose often ""along with local elites"" a vision of the culture as coherent and unified.&nbsp; (5)&nbsp; She gives a useful example of the way colonial agents along with certain local elites defined the practice of sati--a woman mounting the funeral pyre of her hsuband--as a cultureal practice.&nbsp; (5-6)&nbsp; So&nbsp; her view o fuclture is that it is always ""narratively contested""--here think back to her sense that the civilization culture binary was a loss. (6).&nbsp; She explains why she thinks culture is contested--because we expalin what we do in lanaguage and narratives and b ecause these narratives are evaluated... (6-7)</p>
<p>* Sociological constructivism <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">does not</span> see cu;tural diffences as ""shallow or somenow unreal or 'fictional.'&nbsp; Cultural differneces run very deep and are very real.&nbsp; The imagined boundaries between them are not phantoms in derganged minds..."" (7)&nbsp; The point is that one cannot take ""groups' and individuals' cultural narratives at face value.""&nbsp; Intead, and here she is a bit vague, ""to explain human behavior, the student should seek to understand the totality of circumstances of which culture is an aspect."" (7)&nbsp; ie culture is jsut one dimension of experience... but this is imprecise...what kind of power does it have then and in relation to what other factors?&nbsp;</p>
<p>* She states clearly that she dislikes waht she calls ""strong multiculturalism"" or ""mosaic multiculturalism"" on p.7-8.&nbsp; By this she means the idea that ""human groups and cultures are clearly delineated and identifable entites that coexist, while maintaining firm boundaries, as wold pieces of a moasic."" (8)</p>
<p>* She wants to view cultures as ""constant creations""--part of a process of self construction: ""A self is a self only because it distinguishes itself from a real, or more often than not imagined, 'other.'"" (8)&nbsp; She thinks that both on an individual and collective (national) level it is hard to ""accept the 'other' as deeply different while recognizing his/her fundamental human equality and dignity."" (8)&nbsp; In this way, mosaic modernism avoids the key problem.&nbsp; Her view is that democratic equality in a given society rests not on preserving group mosaics but on creating ""impartial institutions int he public sphere and civil society where this struggle for the recognition of cultural differences and the contestation for cutlurla n arratives can take place without domination."" (8)</p>
<p>* She is highly supicious of nationalist ideologies then because she thinks that the ""reject the constitutive 'otherness' at the source of all culture; more often than not,t hey seek to 'purge' the culture of its impure or foreign elements and thus render it whole again."" (8)&nbsp; She refers there to Bhabha's essay ""DissemiNation"" in his <em>The Location of Culture</em>.&nbsp; She gives an example of the process whereby nations rejection culturla otherness in Ataturk's Turkey... (9-10)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* In layzing out, how she will think about the ""cultural politics of capitalist societies,"" she says her position relies on the ""normative principles"" that she laid out in <em>Situating the Self</em>.&nbsp; She is here building on Habermas' notion of communicative or discourse ethics and she laid out<strong> the norms of universal respect and egalitarian reciprocity</strong>.&nbsp; These terms are only valid she says ""only if all who would be affected by their consequences can e participants in a practical discourse through which the norms are adopted."" (11)&nbsp; These nroms she insists already undergird ""practices of discursive argumentation"" and must be ""presupposed in some for for practical discourses.""&nbsp; (11) In discourses, these norms are validated intersubjectively hence she defines discourses as ""procedures of <em>recursive validation</em> through which abstract norms and principles are concretized and legitimized."" (12)&nbsp; Claims that we respect each other must be validated and squared with ""practices and judgements"" that may be experienced by one or another person as disrepect.&nbsp; So practical discourses ""in the broadest sense, include <em>moral discourses</em> about universal norms of justice, <em>ethical discourses</em> about forms of the good life, and <em>political-pragmatic</em> discourses about the feasible.""&nbsp; (12) She conceives of these processes as ""dialogic"" and their goal is to ""concretize and contextualize the meaning of such norms"" as well as to ""determine what kind of problem is being debated."" (12) AND also she instistus, and this seems imortant, that participants must not just have an understanidn gof the norms but a ""situational understanding of these norms' intended application."" (12) Here comes the complex part about multicultural societies then...she instists that it is in this realm of situational&nbsp; understanding that in such societies their is a need for negotiation, siince ""What kind of practice we think a specific cutlural practice is--religious or aesthetic, moral or legal--will determine which norms we think should apply to it."" (12)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>* In relation to this idea that situational understandiing requires negotation she again she gives an example, noting that the British colonial administration in India sought to apply the lessons of its history and the priiinciple of religious tolerance, meaning that ""[a]s long as a practice was considerd central to one's religion, some tolerance was to be shown.&nbsp; But it if twas not <em>religious</em> but merely <em>cultural</em>, in the sense that members of the same religion felt free to engage in it or not, colonial adminsitrators presumed that it should be less protected from colonial intervention, especiallz if the practice in quesiton could also be consdiered odious and offensive to human dignity."" (12) The point is not that they were wrong or that the distinction is wrong, and she notes that many liberal democracies still employ this kind of distinction, but rather to point out that ""very often we do not know what <em>type of practice</em> is in question, for we do not share ac ommon understanding of the disputed practice itself.""&nbsp; Ie is it religious, cultural, or morality she asks? And she notes it can also be that the meaning of such practices is shifting and changing as with the veiling practices of different groups of muslim women.&nbsp; (13)&nbsp; <strong>Ie practices are constnatly being resignified.&nbsp; A practical discourses she says in a process ""through which such resignificants can unfold.""&nbsp; She believes and hopes that "" [a]ttention to such processes of resignification and narrative retelling will alter the line between the universalizable content of moral discourses and the ethical discourses of the good life without erasing it altogether.""</strong></p>
<p>The above is key!!!</p>
<p>* Now she revises her view of universalism...&nbsp; she says that the likes of Kant and Rawls had a ""subsitutionalist"" universalism that proceeded from a ""certain defintiion of human agency and rationality."" (14) These models she says either limit practical discourse to what an individual ""can will or chose, in conjunction with allo, to be a universal law"" or to principles of a just society that ""rational agents, placed behind the epistemic strictures of a 'veil of ignorance,' would agree."" (14)&nbsp; These theories are useful she instsits because they are ""able to provide a more <em>determinate </em>or <em>concrete</em> content of choice and deliberation."" (14)&nbsp; Yet that concreteness comesa t the cost, she insists, of ""abstracting away from the identity of individuals involved."" (14)&nbsp; So ""[s]ubstitutionalist moral theories view individuals as generalized, not as concrete, others."" (14)&nbsp; Instead, Benhabib proposes what she calls a <strong>interactive universalism.</strong>&nbsp; This privileges all people as ""potential moral conversation partners."" (14) and does not privilege philosophers or other certain observers.&nbsp; So it does not limit the ""boundaries of moral disocurse"" to only rational individuals.&nbsp; One must rather leanr the ""whoness"" of others ""only through their narratives of self-identification."" (14) This kind of universalism is central to multicultural societies because cultural narratives are crucial to the constitution of the self... (14)</p>
<p>* Her conception of interactive universalism rests on her conception of self-formation as sometime that is medaited through multiple narratives provided by multiple cultural backgrounds that the individual dialogically weaves together to create a personal identity.&nbsp; She describes this on 15.&nbsp; She mentiions Heidegger&nbsp; Here is how it sounds: ""To be and bcome a self is to insert onself into webs of interlocution; it is to now how to answer when one isaddressed and to now hot to address others.&nbsp; Strictly speaking, we never really <em>insert</em> ourselves, but rather are <em>thrown</em> into these webs of interlocution, in the Heidegerrian sense of 'throwness' as <em>Geworfenheit</em>: We are born into webs of interlocution or narrative, from familial and gender narratives to linguistic ones and to the macronarratives of collective identity.&nbsp; We become aware of who we are by learning to become conversation partners in these narratives...."" (15)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* So she says her approach to multiculti is throug these three components: discourse theroy of ethics that she shares with Habermas, the idea of the ""narrative constitution of the self"", and her sense of ""discourses as deliberative practices that center not only on nroms of action and interaction, but also on negotiating situationally shared understandings across multicultural divides."" (16)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Then she lays out her view of multicultarlism and legal pluralism.&nbsp; She doesn't think it is useless but that it mst conform to basic coditions that are essential for universalist deliberative democracy: egalitarian reciprocity, voluntary self-ascription, and freedom of exist and association. (19)&nbsp; What she gets at here seems quite similar to Holinger's notion of ""association by revocable consent.""</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Nous et les Autres - Is Univeralism Ethnocentric?</p>
<p>* She says this question haunts ""the West.""&nbsp; She points out on 24-25 that the ""classical tradition"" was kept alive by jewisha and islamic scholars like Ibn Sina, Ibn Rushd, Moshe ben Maimon, and Ibn GAbirol.&nbsp; So she wonders when we ask the question about the ethnocentric nature of universalism are we taking int consideration this ""complex global dialogue across cultures and civilizations""? (25)&nbsp; A good point.&nbsp; She rejects the main axis of this debate that rests on a strict moral relativism and the holistic view of cultures as internally coherent and seamless wholes.&nbsp; (25)&nbsp; She belives that cultures are open and polyvocal and that the ""right to cultural self-expression needs to be grounded upon, rather than consdiered an alternative to, universally recogniyed citizenship rights."" (26)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* She traces out th elines of the recent discussion of univeralism.&nbsp; Basically ther eis the idea that human nature consists of ""stable and predicatable passions, instincts and emotions, all of which can be studied."" (26)&nbsp; Thi sis the view of Hobbes, Hume, ASmith, Helvetius, d'Holbach.&nbsp; But this view doesn't require essentialism.&nbsp; She also includes Rousseau and Kant for whom one doesn't need to define an essential human nature to discover an ability to formulate universals by whcih peopple can live.&nbsp; Then also there is Sartre who she says repudiated claims about the human condition and says that human life has no meaning but we must make choices to give it meaning... (26)</p>
<p>* Then there are those that have rejected the above views and see universalism instead as a ""justification strategy."" (26)&nbsp; Here she includes hermeneuticists like Gadamer and ""strong contextualists"" like Rorty and ""postmodern skpetics"" like &lt;Lyotard.&nbsp; as well as power/knowledge theorists like Foucault.&nbsp; Frot hese thinkers as she puts it univeralism is a strategy for justification that is really ""trapped within historical horizons and in cultural, social, and pszchological currents."" (27)&nbsp; She uses Thomas McCarthy's phrase to illustrate that these thinkers have a ""critique of impure reason"" :)&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; Then you have these strict universalists like Karl Otto-Apel, Hilary Putnam, Juergen Habermas, Ronald Dworkin, Thomas Nagel,Thomas Scanlon, and Johnn Rawls.&nbsp; They are not essentialists necessarily but ""all share strong beliefes in the normative content of human reason--that is, in the validity of procedures of inquiry, evidence, and questioning..."" (27)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Then also univeralism has a moral meaning that she identifies as the idea of equality and moral respect.&nbsp; (27)&nbsp; And a legal meaning associated with notions of rights, from indivdiual rights to socioeconoimc rights.&nbsp; (27-28)</p>
<p>* <strong>She believes that the views of contextualists or ""framework relativists"" fail because ""the very process of individudating and identifying frameworks contradicts the claims of framework relativism.&nbsp; Framework could be individuated only if there were framework-transcending criteria of evaluation, comparison and individuation.&nbsp; So framework relativists' storng distinction between being 'within' and 'outside' a framework cannot be maintained.""&nbsp; (29)</strong></p>
<p>[Note: I find this dismissal weak.&nbsp; The kind of framework-transcending criteria she is requiring to define coherent contexts/cultures is only necessary to define contexts that are hermetically sealed in the way that the holistic concept of culture that she dislikes would suggest.&nbsp; Are these strong contextualists really imaginging contexts as holistic cultures? I think not. Isn't she setting up a straw man here?]</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Ch. 3 ""From Redistribution to Recognition? The Paradigm Change of Contemporary Politics.</p>
<p>* She now begins three chapters that examine the ""politics of multiculturalism"" and not the epistemological concerns in thinking about universalism-cosmopolitanism, culture vis-a-vis the self that she was examining in the previous two chapters.&nbsp; In this chapter, she's examining the shift from ""redistribution to recognition"" in contemporary political discourse that in particular Charles Taylor identified in his 1992 essay ""Multiculturalism and the Politics of Recognition.""&nbsp; She also quotes Nancy Fraser from her <em>Justice Interruptus</em> at length.&nbsp; Fraser states taht a ""postsocialist"" condition is characteritized by a ""hshift in the grammer of political claims-making"" in which the emphasis is all on ""recognition of group difference"".&nbsp; This can be seen in ""identity politics"" and the ""decentering of class so and and so on.&nbsp; But also in she says a ""shift in the political imaginary, especially in the way in which justice is imagined...The result is a decoupling of cultural politics from social politics and the relative eclipse of the latter by the former."" (quoted on 49)</p>
<p>* She notes at the start that Taylor's essay extracts the term recognition from the German idealist tradition, specifically ""the famous episode of the struggle between two self-consciousnesses, as represented in Hegel's <em>Phenomenology of Spirit</em>..."" (50) I think she means to slightly cut against the legitimacy of the term or reveal it's nationalistic-illiberal origins by making this connection... (50)</p>
<p>* She's gonna walk through this shift and position herself by looking at Taylor, then Kymlicka, and then some observations on the interdependence or recognition and redistribution...(50)</p>
<p>* What she dislikes in Taylor's essay is that he assujmes taht individuals' struggles for recognition are one and the same as a the collectivity they are part of.&nbsp; ""Just as oppressed minorities may have the individual and collective resources to bear with pride and fortitude the wounds and the indignities inflicted upon them, individual claims to authentic self-expression need not run in tandem with collective aspirations to cultural recognition.&nbsp; They may even contradict one another."" (52)&nbsp; For Taylor, this politics of recognition emerged out of the shift away from the aristocratic code of <em>honor</em> to the ""bourgeois notion of <em>dignity."" </em>(52)&nbsp; In this process, according to TAylor, the old idea of dignity acquired new meaning, relating to the search for an ""authentic"" identity.&nbsp; Benhabib picks up the word authenticity here I think from Taylor, but she should give it more critical attention.&nbsp; Instead, she defines it quicly to mean an individual's search for a ""unique identity.""&nbsp; (52)&nbsp; Wihtout questioning the notion of authenticitiy then, Benhabib's problem is with Taylor's presumption that such a search must ""take the form of a search for collective self-expression...""&nbsp; (52)&nbsp; She thinks this is just wrong theoreticallly and also ""politically dangerous"" (53)&nbsp; It is wrong theoretically because it ""comes from the homology drawn between individual and collective claims"" (53) and it is politically dangerous because it ""subordinates moral autonomy to movements of collective identity.""&nbsp; (53)&nbsp; <strong>Indeed, she makes a decently good point that this reverses things since in her view historically the ""right of the modern self to authentic self-expression derives from the moral right of the modern self to the autonomous pursuit of the good life, not vice versa..."" (53)&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>*Here she catches Taylor in a possible contradiction, stating that he must also believe autonomy and authenticity to be ""complementary normative principles"" since he states, she quotes him, that ""everyone should be recognized for his or her unique identity."" (53)&nbsp; And if so, she notes that he must recognize that there are moments when collective movements may conflict with individual claims to autonomy. (53)&nbsp; She gives an example from the debates about the rights of First Nations in Canada.&nbsp; Their women are not allowed to be the basis of the special rights afforded to members of the First Nations even though that asymmetry contradicted the Canadian Charater of Rights and Freedom of 1982 that granted women equal civial and political status... (54)&nbsp; Faced with such a dilemma, Taylor's response is to say that certain immunities from individual rights have to be made for cultural claims.&nbsp; (<strong>54-55</strong>) She thinks this is plausible, but skirts around the problem, which is that the principles must be ordered to create a ""clear differentiation between the claims of autonomy and those of authenticity."" (55) As she sees it, the principle of the right to autonomy is more important and runs prior to any right to collective self-expression.&nbsp; She makes this point on 55-57.&nbsp; She notes that Taylor draws on Herder's sense of language and culture as the necessary basis of self-identification...Taylor uses the idea that our subjectivities are all tied up in a ""web of interlocution"" and that these are the basis of our search for self-expression.&nbsp; From her point of view, it is only because the individaul needs these linguistic cultural contexts to achieve autonomy that collective rights have legitimacy.&nbsp; ""In other words, the individual can be seen to have a 'right'--that is, a morally justifiable claim of some sort--to the recognition by others of structures of interlocution within which he or she articulates her identity, only if it is also accept that each individual is equally worthy of equal treatment and respect."" (56)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* But all of this she now points out is also <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">extremely idealistic</span> because it all presumes a ""seamless web of interlocution through which individuals are held together."" (57)&nbsp; That's not how it is, though.&nbsp; There is conflict and complex questions of justice and limited resources, and all of this is somehow left out of the politics of authenticity/recognition. (57)&nbsp; In a way, she notes, it assumes that justice and equal distribution of resources already exists.&nbsp; ""Claims to authenticity presuppose claims to justice; or the pursuit Bof collective difference presupposes a framework sustained by the premises of individual equality."" (57) But because these questions of justice have not been resolved there are conflicts that are unavoidable. Taylor recognizes these conflicts, but she seems to say resorts to a language of cultural inferiority/superiority based on degrees of respect for equal dignity that they afrord their members.&nbsp; She is uncomfortable with this language, again, because it uses what she has called this reductionist socialogy of culture, which she hates.&nbsp; (57-58).</p>

Of Feys and Culture Planners: Margaret Mead and Purposive Activity as Value,"<p>p. 110 - 111 Mead's Notion of Freedom (her Liberalism) Sullivan says she only described it negatively. It wasn't a prodcut of ""repression"" but a ""endless free imaginative elaboration of an obsessional pattern."" (110) Apparently, Mead somehow connected this with a lack of ""full genital activity"" but Sullivan sort of dismisses the idea and can't explain the connection. He then notes however, that Mead may here have something in common with all liberal theorists: Locke and Hobbes and Dewey. He notes that Dewey had written ""freedom is found in that kind of interaction which maintains an environment in which human desire and choice count for something."" (quoted on 110, source of quote not clear, Sullivan cites Dewey's Human Nature and Conduct, pgs. 10, 303). He also cites several bios of Mead etc and claims that Mead had carried a copy of this book with her as a undergrad. (110) COMMENTS: 1) The idea of freedom not coming from ""repression"" but from repetition of an ""obsessional pattern"" is interesting in that it connects with my argument in Ch.2 &amp; 3 that coercion was being perceived by these people as a force which the individuals perpetuated by themselves perhaps unconsciously. It is interesting also that she didn't see it as repression (Freudian?) ...since that distinction makes Freud's account of internal division seem to be a simple internalization of coercion... Sullivan also develops this further in ways that suggest (though he doesn't say it) that she became involved in the thinking about the authoritarian personality. In a passage for which Sullivan cites letters between Mead and Erich Fromm and Dollard he writes: ""In accord with the climate of opinion associated with such liberal theorists, Mead developed a constellation of related traits that constituted ground against which her notion of freedom might be understood. Among these traits, Mead included a lack of intellectual enterprise, a paralysis of initiative, a refusal to perceive strange or intrusive facts, an unresponsiveness, and a preference for admitting ignorance. Freedom would be manifested as intellectual enterprise, initiative, responsiveness, and affect, as well as an unwillingness to admit ignorance. In the Balinese case, the absence of freedom and conscience was made tenable by the iron-clad system."" (111) COMMENT: The traits he listed as indicating non-freedom seem to have something in common with the ""authoritarian personality"" traits, see related ""The Strange Death of the Authoritarian Personality"". How closely was mead tied into this community of people, who pursued understanding of the authoritarian personality. This is also interesting because it is early...before the war! When did Fromm come to the US? Were these guys already doing this study in Germany? When did their US studies begin, only after the war?</p>"

(91))&nbsp; Handler pushes back against this critique: ""Wehn Sapir wrote that 'every individual is...a representative of at least one sub-culture,' he added that 'frequently...he is a representative of more than one.' <strong>That qualification directs attention away from individuals understood as self-contained monads and toward individuals multiply defined, as it were, in terms of their participation in a range of varying social relations.&nbsp; Moreover, Sapir's focus in this passage is on culture locatedin 'the interactions of specific individuals,' a phrase that suggests ongoing experience as the object of the anthropologist's study.&nbsp; On the other hand, Sapir tended to treat personality as 'a reactive system which is in some sense stable or typologicall;y defined for a long period of time, perhaps for life.'&nbsp; When he challenged the 'givenness' of culture by urging study of 'the culture-acquiring child,' he attribute, at least by implication, a fixity to 'personality definitions and potentials'--present 'from the very beginning' of the child's life--that he explicitly denied to culture.""

Women in the Professions: A Research Agenda for American Historians,"p. 284 - 289 Professional Women and Women's Culture

-- Relation between work and culture?  In 19th century, Nancy Cott, Mary Ryan etc posited a ""casual relaitonship bewteen the nineteenth-century sphere of women, with its sex-specific language, customs and institutions, and female participation in larger public spheres."" (284-5)

-- When it comes to professions and women's culture, attention must be focused on relatoinship between professional women and volunteering.  In 19th century, work outside the home was done as volunteer work often, as philanthropy e.g.  Many women ventured into professional realm as volunteers, contributing to professional work from the ""periphery"" as it were.  (285)

-- Women also often took the role of popularizers of scientific info (285) ""According to Kohlstedt'[s schema, the activities of the amateur and popularizer gradually helped to legitimate an institutional role for the woman scientist, albeit a small one."" (285) See Sally Kohlstedt, ""In From the Periphery: American Women in Science, 1830 - 1880"" SIGNS 4, 1 (Autumn 1978): 81-96.

-- Women functioned as local historians whereas academic historians alwyas men.  That schema captured in 1919 law in NY State that mandated the appointment of a historian in every municipality.  In 1981, 80 percent of these local historians were women over 55.  At writing of article, there were still about 1600 such volunteer historians.  (285-286)

-- Also upturns and downturns in involvement in professoinal life.  1900 to 1920 there were more women doctors than any other time in American history.  Decline in involvement in professional fields by women occured sometime between 1920s and 1950s and had continued until time very recent to writing of the article.  Estelle Freedman argued that this declining presence had to do with the abandonment of the women's sphere, i.e. this argument that ""Women gave up mahny of the strengths of the female sphere without gaining equally from the man's world they entered."" (quoted on 286, see her ""Seperatism as Strategy"").  

-- Professional Women may have imbibed from culture of professoinalism hostility to amateur and volutneer and therefore to forms of activity outside the home in the women's sphere (286)  They note that nurses often seemed to sympathize more with doctors than other women. (286) 

--  Finally authors put forward a hypothesis, that the relegation of women to the fringe ""helping"" or ""semi"" professions, speeded what Abbott has identifiedas a ""process [in professionalization] of 'regression' or retreat from 'front line' contact with all but hte most rewarding and mannerly of clients...""

<p>* In doing so, she says she is drawing togetehr Arendt and Spinoza. Ie Arendt's notion that ""what makes man a political being is his faculty of action"" and Spinoza's notion that emotions are a ""wavering of the mind"" that can increase or decrease a person's ability to act. (2)</p>
<p>* More reflexively she suggest that the book is also a meditation upon the ""circumscribed standpiont"" of literature in modern society: i.e. the ""modern"" idea that art and literature are ""realtively autonomous"" and cordoned-off in an increasingly specialized and differentiated society may be related to the ""powerful powerlessness"" that she finds interesting in Bartelby the Scrivner. (2) And she wonders whether this self-reflesive preoccupation with its own powerlessness which is typical of ""bourgeois art"" may in fact be precisely the thing that ""makes it capalbe of theorizing social powerlessness in a manner unrivaled by other forms of cultural praxis."" (2)</p>
<p>* From here she suggest that lit may be an ideal ""space"" within this differentiated society to explore ""ugly feelings"" that are generally significant. Her point is that these feelings, which are literature's focus in some way, deal with a ""situation of restricted agency"" which is typical of all the other professions within a world that is ""highly differentiated and totally commodified..."" (2)That is bourgeois art in the modern world increasingly accepts a resigned, passive, and pessimistic view of its own relatinoship to political action, which is thematized in these ""situtatinos of passivity"" that she will epxlore (3)</p>
<p>* Thus each of the emotion that she will explore in her different chapters can be thougth of as ""a mediatino between the aesthetic and the political..."" (3)</p>
<p>* She wants to look at these links between negative affect and politics in order to recover the ""<em>critical</em> productivity"" of these ideas. She acknowledges that these negative feelings are ambivalent; they can ""seem to be the psychic fuel on which capitalist society runs"", but she also thinks they can resist ""reduction to mrere expressions of class <em>ressentiment</em>...[or] their counter valorization as therapeutic 'solutions' to theproblems they highlight and condense."" (3)</p>
<p>* She takes Virno as a strong warning. That all these fears and negative affects are translated in modern professioanl life into a mandate for flexibility and adaptability. ""Here we see how capitalism's classif affects of disaffection (and thus of potential social conflict and political antagonism) are neatly reabsorbed by the wage system and reconfigured into professional ideals."" (4) She notes taht this Virno-ian thesis runs strongly coutner to Jameson's thesis about the ""waning"" of negative affect in the contemporary moment, i.e. his idea that postmodernism celebrates all this empty positive reinvention through ""play""?</p>
<p>* What also interesting about Virno's account is that he shows that tehse negative affects have become ""perversely <em>functional</em>"".&nbsp; they have become he suggets ""the very lubricants of the economic system which they orignally came into being to oppose."" (4) [That is, these ideas have also been used by capitalism] Virno also insistst very interestingly that the functional development and significance of these negative affects are ""open to radically conflicting developments."" (virno, quoted on 4).&nbsp; She gives this interesting example, that opportunism, which is one of these negative affects (?), has changed our relation to the world so that, in virno's words, <strong>""our relation with the world tends to articulate itself primarily through possibilities, opportunities, and chances, instead of according to linear and univocal directions."" (4) </strong></p>
<p>* <strong>No it gets really good. She says that she thinks we could argue that there is a moment in ""transnational cpaitalism"" today wherein ""emotions no longer link up as securely as they once did with the models of social action and transformation theorized by Aristotle, Thomas Hobbes, and others under the signs of relatively unambigous emotions like anger or fear."" </strong>(5) I.e. these feelings provide a key or index to a changed state of the ""sociopolitical"", and that's why looking at them can be helpful. Feeilngs like opportunism, for all its ""pettiness,"" can call ""attention to a real social experience and certain kind of historical truth."" (5)</p>
<p>* Ngai notes that ""emotions"" are generally ignored in political philosophy, except for Hobbes and Machiavelli. Emotions ahve traditionally played a role in the philosophy of aesthetics, where they were discussed i relation to so-called aesthetic emotions, ie. emotions aroused by encounters with art. The first such instance of this was Aristotle's description of catharsis in response to greek tragedy, but for both Hobbes and Machiavelli, and for philosophy of aesthetics, anger and fear (ie cathartic, moralistic) emotions have been the most important. (5-6)</p>
<p>* By contrast, her book's negative emotions are ""amoral and noncathartic, offering no satisfaction of virtue, however oblique, nor any therapeutic or purifying release. In fact, most of these feelings tend to interfere with the outpourring of other emotions. Moods like irritation and anxiety, for instance, are defined by a flatness or ongoingness entirely opposed to the 'suddenness' on which Arisotle's aesthetics of fear depends."" (6-7)</p>
<p>* She wants to dintinguish her book from similar histories of ""specific"" emotions because it is dealing with the question -- more theoretical and critical -- of how a focus on negative affects might expand the discourseon emotions in general. So she's participating in the converastion about emotions, but does not want to particpate in these cultural histories of emotion. (6) Her work is thus more theoretical than&nbsp; historical she says (8), but she has chosen to explore different emotiosn within differn socio-historical contexts in which it seems particualrly to be at stake (7).</p>
<p>* She sees a link between certain emotions and certain forms of literature, and this has guided her choice of texts. (9). She goes a bit further saying that she thinks noncathartic emotions have created a certain kind of art that has a ""noncathartic aesthetic: art that produces and foregrounds a failure of emotional release (another form of suspened 'action') and does so as a kind of politics."" (9)</p>
<p>* She sees also a special link between negative emotiosn and irony -- irony entials a certain ""meta-response"" or ""meta-feeling"".&nbsp; A TEndency to have negative feelings about feelings. Ie ""I feel ashamed about being envious."" So negative feelings she thinks are better at creating a kind of ""ironic distance"" than ""grander and more prestigious passion."" (10)</p>
<p>* Talkinga bout two film noir films that she will analyze -- Double Indemnity (1944) and The Conspiracy (1974) -- she describes moments in which there is a stretching out of narrative time in which ""discourse time"" outweights ""story time."" She describes these as ""moments of conspicuous inactivity"" in which there is she think an ""affective disorienttaion."" (14) She means what might be described as ""feeling vaguely 'unsettled' or 'confused'...a meta-feeling in which one feels confused about *what* one is feeling."" (14) She says this is affective confusion and is different thatn an ""epistemological sense of indeterminacy""; this is bewilderment, affective indeterminacy. (14)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>## Ch.1 Tone<br /><br />* What is tone? The New Critics were the first to try to define it, but in a way that she finds inadequate essentially it seems because while, for instance, IA Richards distinguished tone and feeling, his definition of the two in her view was inadequate. Feeling pertained to the ""state of affairs"" created by the poem, while tone referred to the relationship between speaker and listener. Ngai dös not think these two domains can be so easily seprated. (41-42)<br /><br />* She thinks the messy definition of tone of the New Critics had something to do with a discomfort in relation to the idea that when talking about feelings, one simply comes up with ""soft"" impressions, i.e. subjective accounts. There was thus a certain inattentiveness to everyday implications of the objectivity of emotions, which she sees for example in phrases like ""I don't like your tone. You won't get anywhere with that tone."" (42)<br /><br />* But that is where she will focus her understanding of tone: on this objectivity of emotions that are in a sense ""public."" She refers to Heidegger's account of moods, ie moods as ""attunements"" (Stimmungen) ""that arise from and shape or modulate the totality of Being-in-the-world, disclosing the 'situatedness' (*Befindlichkeit*) that enables things to *matter* in determinate ways."" (42-43) She quotes Charles Guignon, who notes that following such a way of thinking our moods are not simply private ""but rather essentialyy public, part of the 'world' instead of something *in* the 'self'."" (43)<br /><br />* In Ngai's words then tone is something like a ""global and hyperrelational concept of *feeling* that encompasses attitue: a literary text's affective bearing, orientation, or 'set toward' its audience and world."" (43) She notes that it is something like what allows us historians to describe a ""collective mood"", e.g. Cold War paranoia. (43) <br /><br />* She says that in thinking about tone this way Susanne Langer's idea of ""significant form"" is helpful. Langer bases her theory in turn on Otto Baensch's notion of ""objective feeling"" (see 44-45) that refers to certain nonsensroy qualities of feeling that ""surroudn and permetate"" an art object -- like a landscape. Langer speaks of a ""semblance of feeling"", reference to Schilleräs notion of *Schein*. Ngai also begins to use the word affect here (46), referring to it as having a ""fugitive presence."" She acknowledges again that this notion of tone is difficult to define, but insists that that may be because we lack a vocabulary to tlak about it, its forms and structures. And she insists that it is a real thing (has an ontology of sorts) and also has an ""impact"" on a person's subjective responses to things.... (46)<br /><br />* She describes tone then as an ""affective relay between subject and object"" (46).<br /><br />* She thinks this is important for theory, especially when trying to understand ideology. Here things get good. She assert in fact hat understanding ideology may require some accounting for tone. She quotes Grossberg to say that ""Affect is the missing term in an adequate understanding of ideology..."" because it offers what he calls a ""psychology of belief"". Ngai notes that in fact the ""generality and abstractness"" ((47) of tone is suited to understanding ideology precisely because as ""the materially embodied representation of an *imaginary relationship* to a holistic complex of real conditions,"" ideology ""clearly shares tone's virtual, diffused, but also immanent character."" (47)<br /><br />* In next seection, Ngai says she will show tone's effect in an interpreation of Melville's *Confidence-Man*. The analysis is good here. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. The characters in the book are Functionally interchangeable and not particularly distinguishable. She describes the book as giving a sense of ""ironies constantly missed or passing over"" .. a ""meta-ironic feeling of an irony intended for and available to everyone but oneself."" (52) As a result, she says, there is not a focus on characters with emotions, but rather of ""objectified emotions"" -- or affect. (52) <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. She uses some theorist named Tomkins to talk about affect (52-55) as something that creates (affective) analogs to real-world events which allow us to have a concern or care about the world.&nbsp; Tomkins also has a notion of affect's combinatory function, 55. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. The connection to Confidence Man is that the confidence man demonstrates this kind of ""combinatory flexiblity"" of affect, or in fact uses it. Massumi has a notion of ""affective escape"" in which affect&nbsp; continually escapes the forms in which it has been ""captured."" Ngai argues that in Melville's novel, there is a ""vocabulary of affective 'transfer' or transaction, subtended throughout by financial transactions in which values become disconnected from their token in the very act of exchange."" (56) She develops this point well on 56 and 57. The book is set i a period before the intorduction of paper money or greenbacks; it is a period in which there is a flourishing of forms of paper money and written scripts, at a time when the actual value was continually ""escaping"" the money form intended to capture it -- and all this against the background of slavery, and the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. So she's describing this: escape of affect from characters/forms &lt;=&gt; escape of value from money form ==&gt; ambivalence of this escape, highlighted by the meaning of escape and capture against the background of slavery. (57) <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. IN a quote on 58, by Chicago Mayor in 1876, referring to the incredible number of scripts being circulated, their lack of value, and the fear/lack of confidence that this prodcued, the objective emotional/affect link comes in too. Ie the affective tone in this atmosphere in which capitalist money form is so unstable is precisely a lack of confidence, a want of ""conviviality"" (see 59)<br /><br />&nbsp; 5. The confidence man moreover describes himself as using a philosphy of ""analogy"" - where money and confidence are linked, and even become interchangeable. The confidence man's trick is precisely to be able to tranform negative emotions (ie lack of confidence) into confidence, which because of the analogic link between money and confidence, is a commodity. 60-61<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. There is the critique of the book then: that ""cofidence"" is the tone of capitalism, as she puts it on 62. -- this ability, as demonstrated by the novel, to turn the negative emotions into confidence, the dysphoric into the euphoric. (61) So the confidence man says in the novel: ""Confidence is the indidspensable basis of all sorts of business transactions. Without it, commerce between man and man, as between country and country would, like a watch, run down and stop."" (quoted on 62) <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. Ngai shows in an example how the book -- perhaps its&nbsp; critical componnent -- shows how thereis even a confusion about whether an exchange process is an exchange of goods or confidence. See her example on 62, re exchange with an herb-doctor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 8. Although ultimately, and again perhaps here is the critique, there is a kind of failure of the exchange process between affect and money, that leads to a rheotric replacement of analogy with anaphora that disrupts the signifying processes that make the analogic exchange of confidence and money possible. She shows this in a long analysis of an exchange between the confidence man and&nbsp; miser, where the confidence man asks for confidence instead of money, but then asks for money to verify the exchange, at which point the miser breaks down into a kind of repetetive non-sensical language. This is a breakdown in communicative lanaguge that happens throughout the novel, and signals a failure of some sort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9. So what you have then is a double-meaning for this kind of affect. It supports capitalism, but can also disrupt it. When does it disrupt? It disrupts when there is an ""amplification"" creating a ""feedback"" (this language is metaphorical and comes to Ngai I think from S. Tomkins , who links affective reponse and electric response). The feedback in this case is a result of the reflexive recognition of the links between affect, money, and langaue that in her interpretation undergird antebellum capitalism in Melville's novel. The result is that the ""unfeltness"" of the affect of confidence (affect and tone being things, as she noted in the introduction, that are not felt subjectively primarily, but which are general and abstract, are fugitive presences.)&nbsp; The reconition of this unfeltness produces the communicative breakdown. <br /><br />* So after this analysis she thinks she can say what the problem is that is posed by tone, vv an analysis of literature and ideology. The point is that the ""orld of the novel's story *runs on a feeling that no&nbsp; one actually feels.*"" (69) That is, she says that they cannot veryify, even with the aid of ""tokens"" ie money. Their is a danger of a potential failure to be able to acknowledge the ""subjective ownership of 'confidence'..."" and that can cause panic. (69) It can even threaten the system itself she says on 70. At the same time, the unfelt statu of the feeling is what allows the system to operate. So Melville's *Confidence-Man* can (as Michael Rogin has argued) show the empty core of the market, but it also shows the power of this illusion or unfelt affect. (70) The trouble then is the proximity of subjective feeling and affect -- and indeed this is the same difficulty that causes the literary theorist concern, lest they mistake one for the other, hence the centrality of the problem of tone to analysis of literature and ideology. (on this see comment on 69, that literary theorists panic too when they might mistake real for virtual feeling, and then on 71, discussion of Langer's struggle with the same probem.) <br /><br />* She then spends a number of pages going back to Tomkins on 71- 75.&nbsp; The point is basically that the ""noise"" that she sees as entering into the affective saystem of Melville's novel -- ie the reflexive awareness -- also enters into Tomkins theoretical project. He comes up with a notion of magnification, where affective respones are not simply ""amplified"" or made louder while staying the same, but multiply and produce something new, a new set of scences (he was a playwright) along with a script for interpreting this multplicity. But then there arrives also a degree of distoration or feedback, that reveals exceess and ""soemthing separate"" (74) that Ngai compares to that scence witht the miser when the confidence-man engages in a transcation that reveals the illusory chater of confidence. But then Tomkins defines an additional idea of ideo-affective resonance, crucial to ideology, whereby one set of ideas is able to create resonance and ""sympathetic coordination"" between different individuals, with different ideas, despite those difference. Tomkins writes: ""IT is possible and indeed common for different individuals to resonace in different manners to the same ideology."" (quoted on 75) Ngai points out that in addition to beieng a parasite, an analog amplifier, the confidence man may also be an ideo-affective resonater. (75) <br /><br />* To end, however, Ngai points out that tone is a negative affect precisely because it involves the feeling of the unfelt nature of emotion (e.g. confidence).&nbsp; Teh confidence-man continually recognizes the unfelt nature of this feeling of confidence.&nbsp; Whent hat happens there is this extra ""noise"" and that noise reveals the unfelt nature of the confidence that undergirds what she notes Jaean Christoph-Agnew has called the ""placelessness"" of the market, ie its dependence on ""virtual feeling."" The point of doing this for Melville's confidence man, however, is not to prodcue disruption, but to show how the market works. (bottom 76) .&nbsp; That was Melville#s goal Ngai thinks&nbsp; in his most antipyschological novel, that focuses instead on the political uses of affect, of that is the semblance of feeling rather than actually experience feeling.</p>"

Alain L. Locke: The Biography of a Philosopher,"<p>p.016-19  Tension between ""individual integrity and group identity""?</p>
<p>The authors transition from the account of his mother's treatment of Locke as a child to an issue of tension between the family and the outside, expressed in a quote on 15 in relation to his being taught, despite all the affection, not to be too openly affection even with his mother, but also especialy not outsiders.  The authors some it up interestingly this way--although without really showing evidence in Locke's words:</p>
<p>""The inwardness that attaches to a certain understanding of individualism was not necessarily of a radical subjectivity--in which only the inward is true--but rather is seen by Locke as a term in a dialectic relation with how and under what condition one should make oneself available or visible to others."" (16)  This of course ties into the theme of ""frantic respectability"" that they had discussed before when noting the afront to his mother's respectabiity made by the newspaper. The authors seem to think that ocke viewed social values in human experience as a kind of source of ""pollution"" (16).</p>
<p>The authors then bring up Locke's homosexuality...but very akwardly, as though it were something incidental to his existence.  They argue that his mother came to ""represent all the ideal that he felt were worth striving for..."" (16)  IN a quote on 16-17, he talks about his mother dipping him ""as a very young child in the magic waters of cold cynicism and haught distrust and disdain of public opinion"" and that this made him almost an ""hurt-proof child,"" but that there was always the ""all too vulnerable Achilles Hell of homosexuality--which she may have suspected was there, both for her own sake and my own safety--I kept in an armored shoe or servere and haughty caution.  I realize that to bask in the usnshine of public favor I would have to bathe in the dangerous pool of publicity."" (17)</p>
<p>The issue of public exposure also came up in relation to race.  Here again the authors emphasize self-awarness in his family.  The quote Locke stating that laughter was outlawed in their house as ""the antidote of being Negro--the distinguished protest of the 2nd &amp; 34d genreaiton away from slavery...""( quoted on 17).  His father dealt with this informal prohibtion Locke noted by whistling, a sublimation that he authors link to the ""gift"" of education... (17)</p>
<p>On p.18, a paragraph that indicates a sense of the family as having barricaded itself against public exposure...but being honest ""behind closed doors."" (18)  The authors trace the theme of open/closed tension now through a fear of social pollution to a metaphor of war: the barricade.  (18)</p>"

'Let Us Be Sisters Forever': The Sororal Model of Nineteenth-Century Female Friendship,"00 Summarial Note 00

Lasser intervenes into the discussion of ninteenth-century ""female friendship"" first begun by Caroll Smith-Rosenberg, ""The Female world of Love and Ritual"" article (1975).  Her historiographical argument is that previous studies (see f.n. #9) have not focused enough on ""kinship ties"" in female friendship.  They have instead involved themselves in a discussion of the presnece or absence of sexual underpinnings to these relationships. (161-162)

Lasser, noting the conspicuous use of the term ""sister"" between female friends, presents intead a ""sororal model"" within which she argues that women in many cases formed quite literal kinship ties out of what would be termed today ""fictive kin"" ties.  (163-4)   On the way such ties became literal see 168.  For uses of ""sister"" terminology see examples on 1650-168.  Particularly interesting is the case of Lucy Scott and Antoinette Blackwell who married brothers thereby giving their sisterhood a legal basis (178-179)

Lasser argues aditionally that the use of ""fictive kinship"" by the wome paralells its similar use by slaves at the turn of the century identified by Herbert Gutman.  The point was that it allowed these women to build familiar relations where they lacked them.  But Lasser is also clear that these sororal relations allowed women to combat the isolating effects of the separate spheres model (see her description of the three level on which the women experienced sisterhood on 164-165.)"
"From Experts to Social Scientists: The American Anthropologists, 1929-1963","p.009 Re Culture and Professional Dev

""As anthropologists attempted to reconfigure their discipline in the years immediately preceding and following the Second World War, the subject matter of anthropology changed.  IN the prewar years, anthropologists viewed culture as their common subject matter.  The concept of culture, therefore, provided a boudnary to the discipline of anthropology.  Anthropologists, however, never were able to articulate precisely what constituted culture.  They argued that culture was a 'whole' or 'totality' that bound together people.  They suggested that culture had patterns, but they did not specify precisely what the relationship was between the various traits within the patterns of specific cultures."" (9) 

Then, fitting with his idea that the discipline changed after WWII, there is a post-war attempt to reduce the concept: ""Since culture remained a vague concept and anthropologists observed the relations between the elements of cultural patterns as implicit, culture did not lend itself to systematic, pardigmatic, or scientific study.  After the war, various groups of anthropologists redcued the concept of culture to component parts in an effort to make the relations between the elements of culture explicit and study culture systematically....""

Working Knowledge: Making the Human Sciences from Parsons to Kuhn,"<p>General Notes 2/2013:</p>
<p>## Prologue</p>
<p>* The book seeks to define a ""largely forgotten conversation"" that he says belongs to a world of ""postpositivism"" in which there was a detailed conversation about the ""sources and validity of knowledge in the human sciences"" that treated ""epistemology, pratices of scientific research, regimes of profesisonal training, adn the theory of knowledge...[as] intriactely related and mutually reinforcing enterprises."" (4)</p>
<p>* Rather than this being a desire to reduce knowledge to simple formulas -- as with positivism -- but&nbsp; a focus on the idea that knowledge must be ""made"" in a ""craft-like"" manner. (5)</p>
<p>* This language or ""culture of inquiry"" (5) was based in Harvard. It stemmed from a focus on Kant, especially on his theory of knowledge and the ""structures of cognition"" through which people gained knowledge of the world, and yet also in a desire to seek replacements for Kant's transcendental categories of a prior intuition and understanding. They looked for these in the ""actual techniques"" of math and science as practices. (5)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* This culture formed the basis for Parson's ""grand theory,"" for W.V.O. Quine's Philosophy, for Kuhn's theory of science, and B.F. Skinner's behaviorism. (6)</p>
<p>* There was also a very unique instituitonal character at Harvard, which he calls the Harvard complex, through which this discussion of epistemology, disciplinary practice and training, and theory of knowledge wer emediated. He wants to empahsiszed that it was a ""practice-oriented tradition of epistemology"" that emerged of an instituional domain that was ""interstitial"" and ""underinstitutionalized."" (6)</p>
<p>* Hence his title ""working knowledge."" Some will see this as a study of positivism, but he would rather that they not reduce it to that -ism. And after all these catch-all terms he thinks miss the ""everyday"" practice of science, which was in the case of his subjects, the whole point. So he says that he would hope that his readers would realize that his subjects had a ""refined sense of the importance of research practice and pedagogy, and not merely the desire to reduce the content of the human sciences to the material world limned by the natural sciences."" (7)</p>
<p># Ch. 1 - The Interstitial Academy: Harvard and the Rise of the American University</p>
<p>* This chapter traces the rise of what Issac is calling the ""interstitial academy"" and the ""Harvard complex."" It is basically a very innovative analysis of how Harvard's university structure developed in a way that was ad hoc in nature, as a result of a set of competing interests and pressures. Those pressures included professionalization and specialization and the emergence of a marked for professional academics (after Daniel Coit Gilman stole professors from Harvard), one hand, and the embedded-ness of Harvard in the metropole of Boston and its class structures. ""The story of Harvard from the Webber to the Eliot administrations is the story of how problems of this nature were endlessly finessed rather than systematically addressed..."" (61) Systematic transformation in technical education at the land-grant universities such as Cornell or MIT, in graduate training at Cornell, Hopkins, and Clark; and in deparmtental social sciences at Chicago. (61) By contrast, Harvard is notable for its interstitial programs and seminars... This is all interesting though for his argument because of what he says on the last page: there was in the middle decades of the twentieth century a ""drawn-out process of revision"" of the social sciences and in this process he says ""scientific philosophy and the interstitial academy would be centrally invovled in these developments. What emerged from this synthesis was an intellectual culture in which the human sciences engaged epistemology and the natural sciences in way deeply mediated by institutional reform, pedagogical experimentation, and a sensitivity to the knowledge-making practices of working scientists."" (62)</p>
<p># Ch.2: Making a Case: the Harvard Pareto Circle</p>
<p>* This chapter lays out a key intellectual context&nbsp;&nbsp; the interstitial university that Issac is describing and the ""first example of the Harvard complex--the combination of scientific philosophy, the interstitial academy, and the marginal human sciences."" (65)&nbsp; That context is based in an engagement with Vilfredo Pareto's <em>Trattato di Sociologia General</em>e, published in 1916, that took place within a group of Harvard faculty and students that began to meet in a weekly seminar in autumn of 1932 to discuss the book. The seminar was called ""Pareto and Methods of Scientific Investigation."" This seminar has been treated as one of the key sources of ""structural-functional"" sociology in US thought, and has also been viewed as a conservative reaction to Depression era politics. Issac thinks these interpretations miss 1) that it was Pareto's ""theory of scientific knowledge"" and not his critique of social democracy that interested the seminar's main initiatino Lawrence Joseph Henderson and 2) that the ""Pareto vogue found its strongest influence and support within the interstitial academy."" (64)</p>
<p>* Why was Pareto appealing? For Henderson it had to do with the way Pareto helped him deal with what Issac calls a ""metaphysical self-consciousness"" that he had developed from his ""generalization of Josiah Willard Gibbs's model of physicochemical system"" into many different fields of scientific inquiry. This work had made him aware Issac says of the ""explicitly conventional nature of the systems studied in the physical and biological sciences..."" (66) Gibbs' framework may have been an abstraction but it had a real power: it ""made possible the collection and interpretation of facts."" (66) This sense of Henderson's had been underwritten by his reading of works by philosopher scientists like Henri Poincare and Ernst Mach who were making ""man-made symbolic conventions and a priori frrameworks...respectable..."" (66) So Henderson's interest in ""the concepts of system and organization"" made him cutting-edge. Issac writes: ""In physics, the mechanical world picture had been toppled by relativity theory, after a long crisis during the ninteenth century; the concept of the organized <em>system</em>, spurred by developments in biology, was now the order of the day."" (67) And here is where Pareto came in brecause his ideas appealed to Henderson becasue they provided a way to thinking about ""non-logical"" motivations in social and political life. Pareto called the non-rational ideas that socail agents acted upon ""resideues."" (67) His framework also included the categories of sentiemnts and derivations. Togetehr these categories framed up for Henderson a general system of equilibrium that appealed to him. Issac writes: 'Her was a system of mutually dependent elements existing in dynamic equilibrium much like those Hnderson had studied in other departments of science."" (68) Such a framework Issac said was for Henderson just like a tool: it was artificial but useful. (68-69)</p>
<p>[Note: this sounds so much like Peirce! It is surprising that he does not make an appearance at this point in the book, as a forerunner... ]</p>
<p>* Through Henderson's seminars several faculty and students were linked into this Pareto ""network"" as Issac calls it: Joseph Schumpeter, Pitirim Sorkokin, thomas North Whitehead, Fritz Roethlisberger, Hans Zinsser, Clude Kluckhohn, W. Lloyd Warner, Henry Murray, Elton Mayo, Crane Bringon, Bernard DeVoto and Talcoatt Parsons. Students included: Robert K. Merton, William Foote Whyte, Kingsley Davis, Gorge C. Homans, and James Grier Miller. (63)</p>
<p>* The next section on Mapping the Pareto Network shows how this interest in Pareto was not contained to one discipline. Henderson taught a seminar Sociology 23 and also one on Concrete Sociology, both also formed around Pareto.&nbsp; (71)Through Henderson the Pareto influence touched many disciplines through other than his own. Conrad Arensberg taught in Henderson's Sociology 23 seminar, even though eh ultimately turned more to the social anthropologists Malinowski and Radcliffe-Brown. (71) Henderson's Pareto interest also became the basis for the reformulation of the Harvard Graduate School of Busineess Adminsitration and the Business school through Wallace Donham, such that the focus on business adminjsitration came to be one on ""human relations"" and their management (72-73)!&nbsp; ""Far from being confined to the sminar on Pareto, then, the Harvard Pareto cicle was institutionally eclectic: it connected various schools, departmetns, and research facilities."" (74) This was partly due to Henderson's position in the University. He was a ""trusted lieutenant"" of President Lowell and after Lowell's retiremetn in 1933 his position increased. So that in the end even though a biochemist he ""moved freely through the weakly professionalized human sciences at Harvard, gathering around him as he went a heterodox band of anthropologists, sociologists, and management scientists."" (74)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p># Ch. 3: What do the Science-Makers Do? Migrations of Operationalism</p>
<p>* This chapter traces another important intellectual strand of the interstitial academy at Harvard: operationalism. This line of thinking came from Percy Bridgman's 1927 *The Logic of Modern Physics*. It was also central to Harvard in the psychology dept. Key figures here were :philosopher of science Herbert Feigl, Edward Boring, B.F. Skinner, and Stanley Smith Stevens, Ewdward Tolman.&nbsp; (92-93)</p>
<p>* Operationism appealed Issac says to ""practitioners of weakly institutionalized human sciences."" (94) As with Henerson's ""case-based concetpual scheme"" (explained in ch.2) what operationism did was give reseaerch practices an epsitemological status. Issac says it this way: ""we can identify in operationism an ipstemological conceit that placed the practices of research--in thise case, the procedures of the experimental pscyhologist--into epistemic roles. To instist that scientific concepts by synonymous with the operations through which they were applied was to say that the scientific procedures of the laboratory were the <em>content</em> of empirical concepts."" (94)</p>
<p>* Issaac says that what ""licensed"" this intellectual move was the ""tradition of scientific philosophy"" that he is tracing. He describes this chapter's treatment of operationalism as in part a ""parallel case"" to Henderson's theory of social systems. (94) In reaity, what Issac is doing here is laying the second plank of the ""Harvard Complex"" appraoch to the study of the human sciences. Operationalism represented a push from the pscyhological direction within the interstitial academy at Harvard to work out a ""empiricist epistemology free from the metaphysical flights of fancy and a prior stipulations of traditional philosophical accounts of knowledge."" (124) Ultimately, he says at the end of the chapter, Skinner and Stevens were joined in this enterprise by the renewed Vienna Cricle of logical empiricism that also formed in Harvard's interstitial academy in the 1930s, and which also sought to establish a solid empirical epistemology. Logical empiricism is the subject of Ch.3. (see end of 124 for this connection).</p>
<p># Ch. 4:</p>
<p>* This chapter sort of brings all this together describing with WWII and its aftermath the growth of a new kind of interdisciplinarity and ""behavioral sciences"" that was both a product of a kind of ""scientific revolution"" brought about by the money and organization and experience generated by wartime and military interest in managing ""human resources."" Central here is Parsons and the founding of the Department of Human Relations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Parsons' strategic failures in DSR led to tensions. Key were disagreements around the word ""functionalist"". Parsons who believed based on the background of Pareto and the Harvard complex that theory was the way to forge an overarching theory, insisted on an understanding that there were clear functional categories, whereas other members (the ""younger"" members who according to Parsons' organization were set apart from teh ""senior"" members), pointed out that the ""function"" of something depended entirely on what perspective it was viewed from. What was functional from the point of view of the army was not functional fromt he point of view of the officers or their families, see 183.&nbsp; Parsons insisted that one had to understand what was functional as what was functional to the overall system. (182-184). In the end Parsons' drafted the General theory mostly by himself... (184).</p>
<p>* Chapter then goes into a very wonderful, innovative, and subtle analysis of the way that theoretical knoweldge was understood to exist vv empricial knowledge inside of DSR. It was understood Isaac says that the theoretical knoweldge ahd to be verified in an empirical sense, but not in the way one would assume that it must be verified. Rather in what Issaac describes as a late instance o fthe same emphasis on theoretical constructs as ""tools"" that had been key to the ""scientific philosophy"" tradition he is tracing from the beginning, these theoretical ideas needed to be verified ""in practice"". And one of the main ways that Parsons and Shils did that was through diagrams used to illustrate in a tool the entire ""action frame of reference"", or also even more through the idea of ""pattern variables"" which were axes of perspective orientation in the actor that determined what orientaiton/position teh actor would take. These Isaac said were meant as ""transcendental conditions of action"" that worked out in practice. (185-187).&nbsp; The whole enterprise of theorization, moreover, was treated as a kind of empricial practice. Conceptual breakthroughs were udnerstood as ""events"" and described that way on several occasions. (188-189).</p>
<p>* But in 1951, despite all of this, there was no way that the book that Shils and Parsons ultimately produced, The Genral Theory, could serve as a focus of an overaching approach. Homans for one totally disagreed that it should be viewed that way as did Stouffer even within DSR. (189-190)</p>
<p>* But for Isaac this does not matter so much because what he's interested is in the approach, the ""loose weave"" which could not support that kind of overarching interdisciplinaryity that Parsons had in mind. He seems ot think taht is a good idea. And I agree with him. He writes at the end of the chapter: ""...the DSR, it seemed, was in no position to create such a synthesis [as Parsons wanted]. The loose weave of the Harvar complex could not, in the end, service the interdisciplinary ambitions of Parsons, Kluckhohn, and Stouffer."" (190)</p>
<p># Ch. 5:</p>
<p>* This chapter as the title indicates tries to estimate the impact of the form of scientific philosophy that developed in the Harvard Complex and the interstitial academy. Kuhn and his Scientific Revolutions book form the center of this effort. He forms the center because Isaac takes him as an example of a thinker whose intellectual socialization took place entirely and exclusively within the interstitial academy, and thus through him one can see what the effect of a ""scientific philosphy"" in which ""epistemology, pedagogy, and reseach practices were interchangeable"" might be like. (192).</p>
<p>* There's an interesting coming together of the language that Isaac has used throughout the book in the first few pages of this chapter that informally weigh the postivies and negatives of this interstitial academy at the outset. In the first two paragraphs for example he already describes how the interstitial academy was ""too diverse and amorphous to provide the basis for a coherent independent department or an integrated general theory."" (191) But the on the other hand, at the start of the next paragraph the interstitial academy he says did provide an ""education that escaped the confines of professional socialization."" (191) ON this later point, many of the figures that Isaac has already dealt with received this education, but only Kuhn, he says, was a pure product of the ""interstitial mind."" (192) (191-192)</p>
<p>* Kuhn's own theory of science, however, was not unprecedented. L.J. Henderson had begun the tradition at Harvard with his founding of a history of science course at Harvard in 1911. Other schoolars such as Robert Merton, George Sarton, Philip Frank, Bernard Barber, James Conan Bryant, all contributed as well. But these questions about the relationship of scientific inquiry and science -- which revolved around questions like: to what extent could science be conceived of as a social inquiry? and what were the beneifts of scientific thinking to society? -- became more important in the age of the atomic bomb and in the ""context oriented scientific philosophy promoted by the Harvard Complex."" (193) (192-193)</p>
<p>* Isaac usefully situates the war and the bomb in relation to this increased attention on the relations between scientific inquiry and society 194-196. The bomb on the one hand forced the issue because it make the high stakes clear, but more deeply -- and here Isaac cites Gallison -- was ""Big Science"" -- ie the growth of science as a new estate consisting of trained scientists and experts, a new class, that was visible on the landscape. Isaac point was that it eventually dawned on people that this new group of people, whose practices and self-identity was largely unknown to most people, was a new social estate, and the question was how did they fit into the existing poitical traditions and social norms. (196).</p>
<p>* As well, a debate develops already in the 1930s, sparked by a paper by Boris Hesen, a soviet scientists that had come with Nicolai Burkharin, to a conference that was called ""The Social and Economic Roots of Newton's <em>Principia</em>"" and which crudely interpreted Newtonian science as satisfying the needs of the English capitalism of the time. The paper led to a whole set of debates in Britain. The Marxist molecular biologist J.D. Bernal as well as some other set up a dept. The Social Relations of Science that rather than exploring the social basis of science pushed instead for science's socialization. ""Bernalists"" Isaac says wanted to see science put to the use of social planning., and many of them saw WWII as a chance to make this happen. This push was opposed by Micahel Polanyi, a professor of chemistry at Manchester, who was disgusted with the Bernalists ""utilitarian"" conception of science and favored instead a way to value science as a kind of craft complete with intuitive emphases. The Bernalists came to be"" called ""extenralists"" and Polanyi an ""internalist."" (196-8)</p>
<p>* At Harvard both internalist and externalist approaches were weclomed. But the externalist approach of Bernal was eventually severed from the notion of social planning. As Isaac puts it, ""external studies of the social and historical development of science were to be welcomed. For to speak of the 'social relations of science' implied neither the harnessing of science to ends set by the state, nor the determination of scientific knowledge by the means and relations of production, but rather the affirmation of democratic values that, by their very existence, created a climate for the serendipitous discovery of the truths of nature. From World War to Cold War, the ideological imperative of anti-totalitarianism had severed, at least in the United States, the links Bernal had traced between the results of scientific inquiry and its social organization."" (200)</p>
<p>* That said, there was a consensus about the precise relationship between the ""social support of science and the truths scientists could be expected to adduce..."" It emerged slowly after 1945. Isaac takes Philip Frank's attempts to revive a Unity of Science program in Cambridge as an example. He formed the Inter-Scientific Discussion Group in Sept. 1944. Parlty the goal here was to revive the Vienna Circle for a new age of nuclear energy and electrical engineering... What Isaac means by the Vienna Cricle here was the philosophy of logical empricisim that was brough tto the US by some former members of the Vienna Circle during the 1930s..., see 125-126. He ultimatley gainedd funding from the Rockeller Foundation and the American Academy of Arts and Science for a new institute of Unity of Science. In his formulation, there would be more empahsis on the socio-psychological dimensions as well as the logical -empricial analyiss of science. Specifically, Frank was concerned with the threat posed to ""liberal education"" (201) by specialization and fragmentation.&nbsp; He felt there was a way to recover some unity, by focusing on the ""cross-connections"" between the sciences. He promised a new coordination of the human sciences under the banner of physics. (201) The problem he construed as linguistic, several fields used ""the same words in totally different meanings and, what is worse, in slightly different meanings."" (Frank quoted on 201). Frank thought the tools of logical-empiricism could address and possibly resolve this issue. (201-202) There was also a pedagogical side to Frank's goals: he though that bridges could also be constructed by making clear the ""human values which are intrinsic in science itself."" (202) nd here too he thought logical-empiricism could help. (202) Isaac desribes Frank's ambitions as ""a rehabilitation of the cultural ambitions of the [Vienna] Circle, which had encomapssed adult edution, urban and eocnomic planning, and architectural modernism."" (203) Isaac says tha tmostly Frank was able to ""fit these activities into the internal/external divide that characerized this history and philosophy of science at Harvard."" (203) But also in some of his discussion of the ""'behavioral' aspect of the validation of scientific theories"" the different interesting in scientific control fo science that went back to ""Neurath's socialist faith in the potential for scientific ocntrol of science showed through... "" (203)</p>
<p>* Another approach -- that Isaac says was more squarely planted in the Harvard Complex tradition -- was devleoped by President Conant in his attempts to formulate a plan for ""general education."" He too was concerned with fragmentation. He had earlier attempted to solve the problem via a course on American history, but this was viewed as a failure. He tried again in the 1940s, and came to focus on the case-study as a way to teach an understanding of scientific process -- in particular the ""challenges"" of overcoming certain intellectual problems in science case-by-case -- to people who were not trained as scientists and thus lacked a scientific. Isaac notes that Contant's interest in the ""challenges"" faced in overcoming certain problems betrays a sympathy of the internalist ""artisanal"" conception of epistemology. (209) A striking quote by Contant that really shows Isaac's point about this use of the Harvard Complex's artisanal conception of epistemology:</p>
<p>&gt; The texture of modern science is the result of the interweaving of the fruitful concepts. The test of a new idea is therefore not only its success in correlating the then-known facts but more more its success or failure in stimulating further experimentation or observation which is in turn fruitful. The dynamic quality of science viewed not as a practical undertaking but as development of conceptual schemes seems to me to be close to the heart of the best definition [of science]. It is this quality which can be demonstrated only by the historical approach, or else learned by direction professional experience. (208)</p>
<p>* So Conant believed that the effect of science could only be demonstrated via the ""case method"" (see 208-209), and in this shift Isaac notes a transformation of the Harvard Complex: ""The artisanl conception of epistmeology that the merging of pedagogy, research practice, and knowledge-making had created in the era of Henderson had changed its meaning in the early years of the Cold War. Now the case study was being used not to make or validate practitioners of a craft, but as away or encouraging those who did not possess a scientific conceptual scheme to apprecaite the activities of those who did. Instead of seeding disciplines, the pedagogy-cum-epistemology of the Harvard Complex was attached to a general education program the purpose of which was to reach beyond disciplinary boundaries."" (209-210)</p>
<p>* Kuhn reconceived of Conant's solution. Contant's theory had ideas about how one could ""demonstrate"" the scientific method to nonscientists, but he did not understand how scientists themselves acquired the ability to conduct scientific investigations. His theory here which emphaszied the ""stumbling"" way in which problems were overcome just glossed a great men type of theory that went back to Henderson's artisanal view of the history of science. Kuhn fixed this by collapsing the distinction between how one would demonstrate scientific inquiry to nonscientists themselves worked. In his 1962 <em>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</em>, he ""pushed Henderson's and Conant's pedagagoy into the analysis of science itselfand thereby combined it with an account of research practice and the creation of empirical knowledge."" (211) His book contained a ""novel synthesis of the theories of pedaggoy, epistemology, and research that had developed in the Harard complex since World War I."" (211)</p>
<p>* Isaac describes Kuhn's own epistemological views on 210-217. Key is the fact that he himself grew out of a education that noteably lacked much disciplinary training. Key is a moment in which Kuhn is reading Aristotle's <em>Physics</em> and has an eiphany in which he sees the world through the whole set of assumptions that Aristotle had employed to animate his physics. This shift of view forms the basis of Kuhn's basic ideas in which it is taken as axiomatic that the underpinnings of the scientists' working method is secured and reinforced and animated by a wide set of commitments, or what he calls in Structures a ""world view."" (see also 222 for that wording).&nbsp; The views that he developed on the way to this broader claim, Isaac traces in notes on reading he did in history and philosophy of science:&nbsp; 1) a criticism of the idea that the ""relationship between theory and experiment, or between a concept and its application, could be accounted for in the terms of logical postivism or operationism."" (216). For him, most scientific statements according to ""verification theory"" or ""operational analysis"" would be meaningless because they ""did not lead directly to confirmation in immediate experience."" (216) But the point here was ultimately about language: ""how language both conditioned thought and mapped onto experience."" (216). 2) Coming out of child learning, esp. Piaget's idea abot how children developed conceptuaizations that filtered the physical world's complexity; this led to a distinction between the ""physically visible world"" and the ""pscyhologcially visible world."" (216) All this comes together in a quote on 216-217, which is great, where he puts this together: we great gestalt's/conceptualizations of the world, we isolate objects and give them names. So ""We are thus consciousn of the phys[ical] r[eal] w[orld], but can only 'see' and can only <em> talk </em> about the psych[ological] r[eal] w[orld]."" (217) Then science he says is an attempt to ""minimize the verbal equipment implied by (or inherent in) the"" psychologcial real world. So then sicence changes the psychological real world, and brings ""new features"" into it, ultimately ""expand""ing it. He ends the quote: ""Thus the process is contuing."" (217)</p>
<p>* Then Isaac traces the move to Structure. The key historiographical point seems to be at the end when he notes that while Kuhn's hero in terms of the ""priority of paradigms over rules"" (ie. because in the earlier draft of the book, Kuhn has spoken not of paradigms but of rules, and then moved twoard paradigms, which stresses more the unconscious nonconsensual but merely existing factors securing certain ways of thinking and operating) was Wittegenstein, that in fact it could also have been Henderson and Conant, for his ""description of paradigm-based pedagogy was similar in may respects to the practitioner's logic of cases and instrumental, resarch-enabling coneptual schemes outlined by Henderson and Conant."" (225) For further proof of this, Isaac notes that Kuhn did not actually describe any ""pedagogical regimes in particular fields"" that he at the same time insisted were ""so vital in explaining the potency of paradigms."" (225) I.e. there was no systematica historical study of such institutions and their effects on figures like Newton, Einstein or Boyle were initiated into their disciplines. Isaac asserts ""It would seem that Kuhn eschewed the history of science pedagogy and relied, in addtion the novel fifth chapter of <em>Structure</em> [in which he lays out the theory of paradigms], on his own familiarity with the pedagogy of the case history in the teaching of non-scientists."" (226) What Isaac means here is that Kuhn somehow used the ""pedagogy of the case history"" that Hendreson and Conant drew on in making his argument... I think. ...&nbsp; Then in the next paragraph, he assserts that Kuhn was always involved in the pedagogical side, and that the point was to disabuse students of the ""textbook"" view of science in whcih science was seen as an ""imposing body of knowledge"" and not a process. So then what Kuhn did was to take this case-based thing futher, as Isaac said at the start. He had used the case-based pedagogy as a teacher and also applied it to the ""knowledge-making activities"" of scientists; that is, unlike Henderson or Contant, ""Kuhn used pedagogy to explain the historical cases of scientific advancement he employed in the education of non-scientists.""</p>
<p>* Isaac ends this chapter cleverly: ""This [Kuhn's use of case-based pedagogy used to education non-scientists as a way to explain scientific advancement] was not quite a closed circle or a feedback loop. What we see in <em>Structure</em> is yet another combination of pedagogy, research, and epistemology in the Harvard complex."" (226) What does this mean? It means that this approach of Kuhn's was another form of the scientific philosophy tradition of the Harvard Complex...</p>

Ruth Benedict and the Modernist Sensibility,"Summary and Critique

In this article Handler presents the dilemma facing Benedict in he rprocess of self-formation.  He explains her attempts to work that out in anthropology and the ultimat efailure of that project on the level of individualism (138-139), at least in terms of standards of addressing the political and structrual reality that she was in,  i.e. the growht of corporate hierarchies that destroyed ""individuality.""  

Nonetheless, Handler, perhaps because he needs an out, says in the end that Benedict finds her identity as the objective scientist, and he makes a compelling case for this, presenting some of her confident language from Chrysanthemum and then dropping a quote by Joyce about the modernist artist's non-personality (as opposed to sstream-of-consciousness).  But then he goes to far, saying ""Benedict ...in her anthropological writing achieved the integral personality that she and so many of her contemporaries sought.""  (140)  The trouble with this claim is that it doesn't answer the charge that Sapir would have made that a scientific identity is not an authentic identity at all.  Handler senses this, though, in the last sentence: ""That postcolonial, postmodern anthropology has produced a spate of biographies, histories, and literary-critical analyses of our ancestors testifies, perhaps, to an inauthenticity that we perceive in ourselves and that we try to escape by writing the storied lives of others."" (140)."
Ruth Benedict and the Modernist Sensibility,"p.132 Handler's version of Benedict's key idea

""Benedict's key ideas was that cultures are configured or integrated around one or a few dominant drives, themes, or patterns.  The obverse of the ongoing diffusion of culture traits is the absorption of borrowed traits into a preexistent culture whole.  Benedict argued (in almost unavoidably personifying terms) that each culture selects from material available ot be borrowed, as well as from the creative productions of its own members, and reinterprets the materials that it 'chooses' to incorporate.  Such selection and reinterpretation are to be accounted for by the existence of a 'fundamental psychological set' or 'configuration' that can be taken to characterize and permeate the culture as a whole.""

The Clash of Civilizations?,"p.022-22Basic Hypothesis

Huntington notes the various theories about the ""new phase"" of politics: ""--the end of history, the return of traditional rivalries between nation states, and the decline of the nation state from the conflicting pulls of tribalism and globalism, among others.""  (22)  

He thinks these all catch ""aspects of the emerging reality."" (22)  

That reality will be defined he says by ""cultural"" clashes:  ""It is my hypothesis that the fundamental source of conflict in this new world will not be primarily ideological or primarily economic.  The great divisions among humankind and the dominating source of conflict will be cultural.  Nation states will remain the most powerful actors in world affairs, but the principal conflicts of global politics will occur between nations and groups of different civilizations.  The clash of civlizations will dominate global politics.  The fault lines between civilizations will be the battle lines of the future."" (22)"

Critique and Crisis: Enlightenment and the Pathogenesis of Modern Society,"<p>Notes for thinking on Crisis:</p>
<p>Koselleck describes the effect of the absolutist state as forcing a wedge into the consciousness of the subject. The sovereign took the entire responsiblity for ruling and thus pacified the subject. The subject in turn submerged their conscience, which placed upon them a huge burden of guilt -- presumbly becuase their conscience would lead them to act in certain ways, but that right had been ceded to the sovereign, who had all responsiblity, but not guilt because he acted.</p>
<p>Then later Hobbes, who is aware of this situation because he expereinced the rise of the Absolutist state in France, when Henry IV was assasinated.&nbsp; His answer to the problem it seems according to Koselleck was to relieve the pressure created by the separatiton of guilt and responsiblity in the conscience of the subject by interpreting the subject as always driven by ""passion"" ""by a ceaseless striving for power which iends only in death"" (25) In his analysis, the subversion of ethics to politics in the Absolutist state is less significant or meaningful beacause in his analysis the key and deeper difference is between the subject's struggle for power (war) versus his desire for an escape from this struggle (peace). Koseeleck writes: ""The need to foudn a State transforms the moral alternative of good and evil into the political alternative of peace and war."" (25)</p>
<p>Anyway, here you have ""passion"" as a key guide for...the Hobbesian anthorpology of human nature. As I am tracking the idea of which emotions are central this is key. Need to see how Koselleck develops this...</p>"

The Origins of American Social Science,"[Convergence/Divergence in DR's Story]
In DR's chapter ""The discovery of modernity"" i noticed that convergence/divergence is an issue.  She tells in essence a sotry of divergence starting on 10 with a description of the variants of liberalism, tracing those varitants into a divergent course of scientific thought, positivistic v. historicist, these two traditions increasingly becoming mutually exclusive.  
She's after a science that does both.  And she puts this interms of convergence at the very end of the chapter.  On the one hand she notes that by the mid-nineteenth-century ""more positivistic varints of social science and a more historicist historiography beagn to assume distinct and sometimes conflicting identities."" (20)  Ranke is the historicist who charged Hegel's ""rationalistic system"" violated empritical standards of historigorpahy; historians criticizes Buckle's attempts to find deterministic laws of history in Egnalnd.  Comte and Spencer both urging ""sociologists to look beneath the vents chroniclaed by historiography and did not feel obliged to test their theories agians the full complexity of the historical record.""  (20) 
Still she says ""substantial areas of congurence and contiutiy remained...""  She mentions Marx and Toqueville (having just pointed out that Marx's sociology unliked either Specner or Comte ""worked from close contextual study of the historical record."")  (20)  And she's also taling about ""political science and history [which were] intertwined around the study of national political institutions."" (20)  
Then she says, however, that divergence was the trend.  In the second to last paragraph that in the  early nineeenth century under the ""pressure of social conflict""  the ""liberal social sciences of the Enligthenment split into conflicting ideological programs and liberal social scientists defensively reasserted their vision of modern social harmony.  In contrast to historiograhpy, a major spheres of social sicence became more abstract and systematic, seeking positivistic scientific laws to stabilize the uncertain course of history and gain the authority of nature of rtheir contested social programs."" (21)  
Then the last pargarph notes however that these factors were wieghted differently in each national context.  (21)  In that manner she sets up her next chapter analysis of the way it was weighte in the U.S.  
===
The thing is here that her wholse story is in fact an attempt to trace this divergence and label it as a bad thing.  She implies then that the appropriate kind of sociological study is one that balances historicist and positivist methods... 
It makes me think of the last sentence of her introduction in which she speak sof the hermeneutic circle of the historian.   After noting Pocock's problem of the fate of the republic in time is the question of her social scientist...she says this is the basic problem that sustained her because it allowed her to grapple at a ""deeper level"" with the menaing of the Republic on the one hand and the problem of historical relativism on th eother... i..e on the univerality of the republic? and the potential that it is jsut one solution that will also pass away???  
I.e. the basic question of historicism v. postivism at the bases of the republic itself?  In any cases, she then points out that ""Such grappling is the only answer there is to the historian's endless regress of contextuality.  The hermeneutic cirlce, fo rall the limitations it places upon knowledge, gives us access to the happenings of history and the experience of life."" (xxii)"
"'Passionlessness': An Interpretation of Victorian Sexual Ideology, 1790-1850","00 Summarial Note 00

Cott presents the female Victorian sexual ideology of ""passionlessness"" -- the idea that women by nature lacked lustfulness -- as an ideology through which women were able to claim to possess the characteristics typical of ""moral beings"" that is rational and intellectual beings.  Cott writes: ""The correlation between passionlessness and a distinctly improved view of women's character and social purpose begins to suggest the appeal of the concept to women.  By replacing sexual with moral motives and determinants, the ideology of passionlessness favored  women's power and self-respect.  It reversed the tradition of Christian mistrust based on women's sexual treacherousness.  It elevated women above the exalted purity, felicity, and glory.  It postulated that woman's influence was not ensnaring but disinterested.  It routed women out of the cul-de-sac of education for attractiveness, thus allowing more intellectual breadth.  To women who wanted means of self-preservation and self-contorl, this view of female nature may well have appealed..."" (228)"
Ideas and Institutions in American Anthropology: Thoughts Toward a History of the Interwar Years,"<p>[4] [Stockings' Narrative of Rise of Culture Concept] Stocking makes the argument here as he does in ""Franz Boas and the Culture Concept"" that the idea of culture was implicit in Boas' ideas even though Boas didn't articulate it.   Statements to this effect in this article... ""Boas' thinking about the problem of classification may in fact be interpreted as containing in germ most of the assumptions of his anthropology, both in its critical, and less obviously, in its constructive aspects...[then two paragraph later] Building from the assumptions such as these, Boas developed the systematic critique of evolutionism which, along with the puritanical methodological posture implicit in it, is often seen as comprising almost the whole of his anthropological viewpoint.  But although never systematically elaborated, there was implicit in this negative critique a more positive orientation.  By a kind of inversion of the process of anthropological undeerstanding, one could generate a picture of the fundamental processes of culture."" (4)</p>"
Women in the Professions: A Research Agenda for American Historians,"p. 282 - 4   Occupational Segregation

THIS SECTION VERY IMPORTANT


Description of women's entry into female profession: ""The development of predominantly female professions paralleled the expansion of education and welfare institutions.  By the 1840s, the spread of the public school system had brought middle class women into teaching just as the antebellum 'print revolution' facilitated their careers as authors.  In the late nineteenth century, the proliferation of urban welfare services, hospitals, and public libraries led to the entry of women into social work, nursing and librarianship.  In all these areas th eneed for a cheap, abundant labor force harmonized with prevailing notions of 'innate' female abilities."" (282)

They ask what is the consequence of this ""feminization"" of the professions.  Much literature describes the consequences as negative.  E.g. Ann Douglas, The Feminization of American Culture (1977) and Suggs Motherteacher: The FEminization of American Education (1978).  ""DDouglas links the vapidity and sentimentality of Victorian culture to the hegemony of women; Sugg asserts that the sibustitution of female for male teachers subverted acadmeic authority and led to a 'pedagagy of love' which fostered anti-intellectualism in American schools."" (283) 

In health care, more positive argument argues that ""women fostered a noninterventionist, holistic, prevention-oriented approach toward health."" (283) 


Why was there segregation/feminization of certain professions?

1) because of perceived ""...'fit' between economic need and cultural conceptions of gender roles."" (283)

What was the segregation? 
Engineeering, law and ministry were not accessible to women in 19th century.  Some gains between 1850 and 1890 in medicine.

Where gains were made again often b/c of special raitonalized need for feminine traits: ""The idea that innate feminine modesty and virtue necessitated treatment by women doctors stimulated the growth of a small but significant female presence within medicine, espeically in obstetrics, gynecology, and psychiatry."" (284)

This idea that women could also perform special task b/c they could go into certain areas that men could not access, e.g. with Boas and with Protestant evangelical missionaries, who though women could get into places where ""heathen"" women were secluded.  

Their conclusion then: ""Although the entry of middle class women into the professional workplace appeared quite revolutionary at the time , the patterns of occupational segregation an distribution that developed reflected and sustained male authority.  The feminized service or 'semiprofessions' remained low in autonomy, prestige, and financial reward.  The highest positions of power within the women's fields, i.e. t, the school superintendent, head librarian, and the agency director, were usually occupied by men.  In nursing, where a female-headed hierarchy did developm, women still operated under the formal and informal guidance of doctors and hospital administrators; in contrast, in the develpment of home economics as a professional field, women retained control of the educational institutions until th epremier genreation of careerists retired and was replaced by male social scientists, genreally in the 1960s.""

Freedman argues that there were optimistic but mixed assessments overall.  

-- Women seen as poorly utilizing the vote in a 1920 statistical study and that they hadn't voted predictably.  The implication of the study was however that ""women were politically handicapped--bot by a psychological incapacity for politics, as some critics claimed, but only by lack of experience."" (376)

-- She notes a 1927 forum in ""Current History"" which include positive comments and negative ones.  Charolotte Perkins Gilman wrote here and Carrie Chapman Catt.  Detractor artiles were for example: Anthony Ludovici, 'Women's Encroachment on Man's Domain"" Current History, 27 (1927): 21-25;  Hugh L. McMenamin, ""Evils of Woman's Revolt Against the Old Standards"" ibid., 30-32.

-- V.F. Calverton who she describes as a ""[r]adical editor"" saw economic indep. as more important than political enfranchisement. (376)

-- Many including Calverton noted the persistence of anti-feminist attitudes.  376-377.  

Freedman summarizes like this: ""In spite of indications that only limited women's rights and not braoder feminist goals had been advanced, the optimistic writers of the 1920s generally hailed the participation of women in American society and the end of discrimination."" (377)  She argues a bit later that writers ""strained to emphasize the positive..."" (377) ""...they confidently portrayed the period as one in which feminist goals were well on their way to fulfillment."" (378)"
Beyond Separate Spheres: Intellectual Roots of Modern Feminism,"<p>p.095-103  Women's Researches</p>
<p>In these pages, Rosenberg desribes the research done by Hollingworth ain undermining traditional assumptoins about female physiology which was used to argue for the lesser capacity of women to perform professional work.</p>
<p>Hollingworth's first research began in response to noticing that in a study of her husbands on the effects of caffeine on metnal and motora abilities, that no mention was made of the impact of menstrual periods on women subjets even though he had had women record these occurences.  She could not in the end find any correlation between menstruation and any periodic incapacity.  (95-97).  Instead, she ""attributed the 'strinking disparity' between received wisdom on this subjet and her empirical findings to the bias of most authorities."" (98)</p>
<p>Hollingworth also drewon a study by a woman doctor named Clelia Duel Mosher on the impact of menstruation.  Mosher had found that there was little evidence that peirodic incapacity occured as a rule. (98-99)</p>
<p>These conclusions confimed what Thorndiek, Woodworth, and others had also found with regard to fatigue: that ""the mind enjoys a certain independence from the body."" (99)  This was not Rosenberg says a return to Descarte's mind-body dualism: ""they all accepted the post-Darwinian belief that the mind is rooted in physical structure and physiological forces.  They increasinly doubted, however, that the lik between the body and mind was s simple and predictable as Darwin's early followers had thought."" (99)</p>
<p>Next Hollingworth attacked the thesis that men were more variable that women and that therefore men tended to reach the peaks of ability as well as the lows.  Holloing worth began this study after she received a full time job as the New York first civil serice position at the Clearing House for Mental Defecives, run by the City of New York.  Hollingworth noted that the reason there were so many more retarded males at her clinic was because of ""there eing mahy more boys under siteen years of age than there were girls of the same age."" (100)  She speculated that there weres social rathe rthan natural cuases for this fact, which would have previosly been explained with reference to the theory of male's increased variablity.  Because boys were less restricted, she said, they more often enocuntered the law, whereas women were proteted.  Women encoutnered the law perhaps only afte rthe deaht of her hsuband or after ecoming a prostitute.  she wrote: ""there seems to be no occupation which supports feebleminded men as well as housework and prostitution support feebleminded women..."" (quoted on 100-101).  These observations reinforcd her bleief that women were just as variable as men. (101-102).</p>
<p>The last line of defense Rosenber says of men when it came to women wa sto assert a ""maternal instinct"" as a last word in matters of sex difference.  Thorndiek for exmaple contineud to believe in maternal instnaict even after he had discarded the idea of instinct in regard to self-preservation as too vague.  (102)  At this point Holliongworth, accused experimental psychologists of using a double standard when it came to women.  ""In most of their work, they condemned anthropomorphic thinking and the careless definition of instincts...[and]insisted that researchers should subjet the assumptions that dominated pscyhological work to th emost searching criticisms.""  But then when dstudying sex differnecs they returned to voentional platitude.</p>
<p>Hollingworth thus wrote: ""Thsu in time, may be written a psychology basedon truth, not on opinion; on precise not on acecdotal evidence; on accurate data rather than on remnant of magic.  Thus may scientific light be caset upon the quesiton so widely discussed at present and for several decades past,--whether women may at last contribute their best intellectual effort toward human progress, or, whether it will be expedient forthem to remain in the future as they have in the past, the matrix fromwhich proceed the dynamic agents of society.""

-- First histories pub. in the 30s, but reflected views of years before '29.   (378)

-- Charles & Mary Beard e.g.  Women had they had greater role in shaping numerous realms.  But they saw some negatives too: were wworried about ""the decline in authority of fathers, defiant and divorce-prone women, and the 'more intransigent' demand for ""'absolute and unconditional equal opportunity' in every sphere"" of an equal rights ammendment."" (378)

-- Slosson and Allen both treated positively shifts in fashion, sexual revolution etc which were seen as zones of liberation, see Slosson 378.  Allen saw dep changes in ""feminine ideal"" in fashion shifts.  

Freedman argues that these historical views refelect the tendency in the 20s to present women as ""flappers, more concerned with clothing and sex than with politics.  Women had by choice, the accounts suggested, rejected political emancipation and found sexual freedom."" (379)  The term feminism she ays ""nearly dissapeared from historical accounts. (379).

Women writing histories about women tended to focus more on the political and less on the flapper, though.  (379)

-- She notes critical history by Sophonisba Breckinridge's Women in the Twentieth Century.

History: Professional Scholarship in America,"<p>p.008-9 Prof. Historians' and Amateur Hist.

""Niether a professional ethic nor a mature professional organization came into being over night in 1884. These developed gradually and did not become distinct until the twentieth century. The new school of Ph.D.'s, although quite self-consious in the eighties, had not yet found its place in American culture. It needed the help and sought the aid of everyone seriously interested in history. Aid was readily extended, for the better amateur historians fully shared the professionals' interest in raising the standard s of cultural activity in America.""

Higham writes: ""By the end of the century the chaotic mass had undergone an organizational revolution comparable ot the trust movement in American business.

Such multiculturalism grew out of the account of the development of assimilationist liberalism, but it had inherent paradoxes.   B/c he wants to say it expressed tolerance of difference, but a difference that was not ""Real"" because it was a difference capable of institutional representation.  

In a circular logic then he defines ""Real"" difference  as difference that is ""beyond institutional representation."" (335)  He sees instutionalization of difference as a ""flattening out"" of Real difference, one that requires that the ""aborigine"" perform an authentic identity, which in fact it is impossible to perform.   An identity ""that is idealized by politico-legal apparatus.[sic]"" (334) -- in particular Povinelli's quote on 334 specifies that that identity must be ""a domesticated nonconflictual 'traditional' form of sociality and (inter)subjectivity."" (334)

This distinction of Real v. institutianlized difference he links to Zizek's critique of multiculturalism as a a ""postmodern racism"" that consistst of a ""sanitized multiculturalism"" which presents no ""real Other""...i.e. a form of difference that can not be ""subsumed under the logical of transnational Capital.""

"Shipwreck and Autonomy: Rawls, Riesman, and Oppen in the 1960s","<p>00 Summary Note 00  Esteve is mounting a criticism of the New Left or portions of it that she says depended on a ""countercultural logic of alienation.""  These people including the likes of Mario Savio urged that they and others were alienated (327) and that the solution was to be found in ""authenticity"" which she says means simply ""being true to one's experience"" (328).  She picks up Dou g Rossinow's critique of this that, as she paraphrases it, ""countercultural authenticity grounded itself not in abstract reason, but in such neo-Romantic and Christian-existentialist ideals as inner spirituality and personal and communal affection."" (328)    It is the eschewing of abstract principles that she finds troubling, and she wants to argue that Rawls, Riesman, and Oppen develop an argument, sympathetic though critical of the New Left, that offers Autonomy (which she interpetes as free will , see 324, top) as an alternative to autonomy/alienation (argment stated in brief in intro, 323-325).    The discussion of this is good.  The stuff about Oppen is particularly interesting b/c it gets into poetics a direct engagement in his book On  Being Numerous with the 60s radicals some of whom are his literal children. He holds back from their ""spirit of fatalism"" (which Esteve described  excellently in relatoin to the logic of alienation on 330).  But he embraces a notion of catastrophe as a useful experience for the building of autonomous persons and this is a theme that Esteve pull througout the three men's  arguments, that certain circumstances build autonomy, i..e the difficult historical experience of the 60s youths is a basis for something in these men's eyes ( see in particular, 339-341, 344-5).   In the section on Oppen and explaining this use of catastrphe that Oppen conceives of, she also brings in R. Bourne's essay on the ""experimental life"" where the issue of nonconformity also comes up (337-339).  Nonconformity in this essay is given a sort of ambivalent treatment, for it is sometimes associated with the 60s radicals arbitrary rebellion (i.e. not rooted in a project of building themselves into autonomous selves based on real values).    An interesting issue that I don't understand, has to do with commentary on the ""absolute singular"" in Oppen's work.  As I understand it this is category that comes from Heidegger.  Esteve refers to the ""Heideggerian disclosure of  singularity under erasure"" (340) .  In Esteve's description of Oppen's poem,  the ""absolute singular"" is transformed into the main leitmotif of Oppen's book: ""the bright light of the shipwreck"" (which is the condition in which one can build an autonomy, build something.).

(13)  But as settlers moved in, many such as Lewis Cass -- who became ""one of the leadings architects of federal Indian policy in the 1820s and 1830s"" -- however began to think the Indians were ""unchangeable, in their physical and moral habits, unable to appreicate their own condition, and resistant to education and other attempts to ameliorate their circumstnaces.""  (13).    Ethnology effort came with westward expansion.  Jefferson instructed Meriwether Lews and William Clark to gather ethnological info.  (13)  Cass desgined a questionaire to be filled out by traders, military agents, and indian agents.  (14).  Many of these accounts confirmed Cass's outlook.    In 1823 supreme court case Johjns and Graham's Lessee v. McIntosh ""denied that Indians possessed an unqualified right to their lands and vested tht right instead in the settleers who discovered those lands."" (14)  Even before the logic that the Indians were nomads and not farmers and couldn't change had supported this conclusion via the kinds of argments made by Lock in his Second Treatise on Government that right to land came from the land being transformed through a farmer's labor.  (14)    1830, Cherokee forced off their lands in George and sent on a ""death march"" known as the Trail of Tears to Oklahoma.  (14)</p>"
Of Feys and Culture Planners: Margaret Mead and Purposive Activity as Value,"p. 106 - 110   The Fey type and why Bali was Iron-Clad

He anlayses Mead's developing thought about the Fey type.  On bottom of 109, it explains that Mead's idea was that the fey could be stable because there were no internal divisoins.  The fey was not reactive and had little guilt or consicnece or ""internalized monitors"".  (109)  Sullivan notes that in particular for Mead they  had not internalized the notion of their parents as this internal authority.  

And this was something that Mead generally did not like and he has a wonderful quote from her from a letter to Gorer on August 20, 1936: ""No, I don't think I shall eve like Bali as much as New Guinea.  I suppose I put too high a premium on free energy, either free intelligence or free emotion, and these people have neither."" (quoted on 109-110, Mead to Gorer, August 20, 1936, N5:4 LOC).  And another to Dollard that Gorer thought the ""Balinese happy and I consider that happiness isn't worth buying at such a price.  Not an ounce of free intelligence or free libido in the whole culture."" (quoted on 110, from Mead to Dollard, September 23, 1936, Mead/LOC, N5:4).

So in the end Mead had some notion of a free intelligence or libido which she preferred."
The 'Warfare State': History of a Concept,"<p>Summary Note</p>
<p>The article is best described as a round up of arguments about militarism.  It attempts a classification of these ideas that is useful but not nearly as good as that presented by Nicholas Stargardt in <em>The German Idea of Militarism</em>.  The article is also good in indicating the history of scholarship on the subject especailly from the American point of view.</p>
<p>The categories the author erects are: fear of the ruler's desire to wage war at the expense of his/her people; fear of the warrior; and fear that the merchang might find affinity with war.  So these are anti-political, anti-military, and anti-economic. (130).</p>
<p>The author argues that anti-militarism ""fell of in the nineteenth century under the impact of industrializaoitn and Social Dawrinism"" but ""experieneced a vigorous rebirth in the 18990s in response to rising navalism, jingoism, and imperialism."" (131)</p>
<p>Betewen 1900 and 1917, he says all three traditions emerged to prominence.  He notes a difference between Europe and the US.  In Europe, ""socialists were carrying the principal burden of reform"" and so ""it wasw naturally the capitalists who were most frequently blamed...for rampant 'militarism.' (133) But in America ""where the middle class was a t the heart of both progressivism and the peace movement"" and so it was the soldier and the ruler that were targeted.  (133)</p>"
A Four-Fold Humanity: Margaret Mead and Psychological Types,"p.188  McDougal-Mead v. Benedict-Dewey

Sullivan contrasts McDougal's innate temperament with Dewey's ""interpration of habits"" (he cites Dewey's Human Nature and Conduct, 1930, orig 1922, p. 38) ....  Was McDougal's distinction? Sullivan's wiritng suggests that, and he cites p.22 of 1908/1960 McDougal book.  

Sullivan then connects Dewey and Benedict and notes that Mead had also received a copy of Patterns.  He suggests that Mead's thinking about Temperament and the types outlined in Sex & Temperament evolved from her need to think about types that Patterns provoked.  She was thinking about child rearing and Sullivan thinks she started wondering about a quesiton that Robert Sessions Woodworth, a Psych Prof, had asked: ""Wen does an Indian become an Indian?"" (189)  By 1935 Sullivan say sthat Mead and Bateson had formulated an idea that ""personality"" is formed through interaction bewteen ""(1) the individuals' original constitution, most specifically the innate propensities toward specific psychological tendencies, inherited from the person's own diret ancestors, (2) the patternsof the individuals' upbringing in a specific society, (3) the accidents of the individual's life, and (4) what Bateson (Mead LC N6:2) specifically called '[t]he norms of behaviours in teh culture in which he has grown up and lives...even though he may react violently against it.'"" (189)"
The History of Ethnological Theory,"[3] [Definition of Culture]
Here is a description of cutlure.
""Ethnography is the scence which deals with the 'cultures' of human groups.  By culture we understand the sum total of what an individual acquires from his society--those beliefs, customs, artistic norms, food-habits, and crafts which come to him not by his own creative activity but as alegacy from the past, conveyed by formal or informal education."" (3)
This definition seems to draw heavily on Kroeber's description of the superorganic, rather than, say, Benedict's idea of culture which is based on the predicated on the homology of individual ""personality.""   Kroeber spends a good deal of time designating culture as an accretion of values, habits, skills, etc passed down at a level above the ""creative activity"" of individuals."
History: Professional Scholarship in America,p.
The System of Professions: An Essay on the Division of Expert Labor,"[125-9, 351-2] [Professionalization and Gender]
 Abbott speaks of feminization of professions as one of the most familiar forms of a process he calls ""degraded recruitment.""  (128)  This is one of a set of proccesses he explains in his chapter on ""internal differentiation"" within the disciplines in which a profession divies labor into routine and non-routine pars in order often to become more productive and response to added strains (for examples and explanation see 125-9).  In th eprocess, what had once been seen as professional work is no longer deemed to be and Abbott notes the degredation fo the work is ""sometimes accompanied by the degredation of those who do the work."" (126) 
 In a f.n. #23, 351-2 he, however, he rejects the idea that ""the very of notion of 'profession,' both as real-world label and as social-science concept, is gender- or class-based, and that consequently gender and/or class have been the central determinants of professional development since the Industrial Revolution."" (352)  He is not rejecting the connections between professionalism, status, and gender/class concepts.  He suggests that his own theory--which he doesn't specify here and it seems he's referring to his whole book--explains some of the things that the idea that profession is dependent on gender/class ideas more effectively.  
This opinion should be compared with Galambos' statement on p.9 of Public Image of Big Business which i cited in the proposal (in that professionalism opened new opportunities for women b/c it was a more meritocratic system, and Habermas' idea that the destruction of the public sphere was coincident w/ the rejection of paternal authority.  
Abbott's f.n. #23, pgs 351-2, also includes many useful citation on this quesiton, many of them historical.  He say in the f.n. that he prefers the analysis of the connections between gender, status, and profession presented by Maack, ""Women Librarians in France,"" Journal of Library History 18: 407-9."

Sullivan specultes that Mead's disposition to study ""affect"" or what Bateson called ""ethos"" (the structure of emotiuon"") rather than what Bateson alled eidos ""the structure of ideas"" accounts for her declining popularity.  

Bateson was apparently imporant for cognitive anthropology, and Sullivan here cites Stephen Tyler's Cognitive Anthropology (1969).

"The Knower and the Artificer, with Postcript 1993","<p>Summary of Argument</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Holinger expresses frustration with the term ""modernism"" and its vagueness.&nbsp; It is has been used he notes to describe some American political scienitsts and their faith in scientific knowledge and its ability to deal wiith modern problems (26).&nbsp; But this sense that sceince can restore and order is quite different than the empahiss upon ""artist heroes"" assocaited with Joyce, Kafka, Eliot, Lawrence, etc... (27)</p>
<p>One link , basically the that knowledge ""of the external world was not so easy to come by, that contradictions persisted in human experience, that a real price was paid for the beneifts of bureaucratic rationality, that a large measure of uncertainty was an enduring condition of life, that human beings had a propensity to act irrationally, that it was difficutl to find an unchanging standards for moral judgements, that God might be dead, and that many sensitive indivduals felt alienated from industrial society.""&nbsp; (27)&nbsp; These things he says both aesthetes and scientific intellectuals thought.&nbsp; (27)</p>
<p>So what about strategies for dealing with this?&nbsp; Modenrism he notes is linked to staregies of artifice.&nbsp; This is the idea that one has to ""make meanings anew, our of the reosurces of the self."" (28) Idea of the self artist as creative genius and draws upon romantic heritage.</p>
<p>But what about strategies of ""reference""?&nbsp; Are these part of modernism?&nbsp; He notes (as did DR in the ""INtroduction"" t othis book, p8) that ""modernism"" linked to the former and no tthe latter.&nbsp; He thinks this is an important question and sets up two types: The Knower and the Artificer.&nbsp; He thinks that the question of whether the the knower, who continues to try to make something out of science, even though knowledge is fragmented, is part of modernism.</p>
<p>His argument is in fact that it is central.&nbsp; He thinks it may be a better word to describe things going on in this time than modernism.&nbsp; Anad so he coins the notion of <em>cognitivism</em>, as a cultural ideal common to both modern artists and some modern scientists...(he rejects positivism and scientism on the way to this term...30-35).&nbsp; Def'n of Cognitivism on 35.</p>
<p>On 36-41, he shows this cultural ideal as being important to some American modernists, typically thought of as advocating artifice: JOseph Wood Krutch in ""Modern Temper,"" Wilson's ""Axel's Castle,"" and Gatsby...</p>
<p>So Holling is trying to put ""cognitivism"" in the place of modernism, and in so doing, he would try to give the ""Knower"" his cultural ideal of knowing despite the recognition of fractured subjectivity at the center, and he would sideline the strategies of artifice of the Artificer...</p>
<p>Hollinger also links postmodernism and modernism...noting that postmodernism critics of modernism, criticize modernists for not being referential: ""Canonical modernism, it woudl seem, did not go far enough in exactly the directions that most distinguished that modernism from the cognitivist tradition."" (44)</p>
<p>His postcript pushes his argument further.&nbsp; The postmoderni critique, he notes, has increasingly tended to argue that modernists were too cognitivist, even identifying them with the enligthenment tradition.&nbsp; He thinks this critique is just right...and reveals the centrality of strategies of reference (cognitivism) over strategies of artifice...

""Young--whether in fact or fancy -- assertive, and independent,she experimented with intimate dancing, permissive favors, and casual courtships or affairs.  She joined men as comrades, and the differences in behavior of the sexes were narrowed. She became in fact in some degree desexualized.  She might ask herself, 'Am I Not a Boy?  Yes, I Am -- Not.'  Her speech, inter interest in thrills and excitement, her dress  and hair, her more aggressive seuxlaity, even perhaps her elaborate beautification, which wa sa statement of intentions, all point to this...Indeed, the term sexual revolution as applied to the Progressive era means reversal in the traditional role of women just as it describes a pronounced familiarity of the sexes."" (322)

Note: His emphasis on the ""reversal"" ... this too leading to the anti-feminist argument that women had become ""men""... 

Again you can see this a few pages later in more stark terms: ""Since young women were working side by side with men and recreating more freely and intimately with them, it was inevitable that they behave like men."" (324)"

Later when war created ample opp. for women, there was still no consensus on the ""proper place"" of women in Americna society (381)  Themes can be deduced from textbooks and ""broad surveys of American thought"" (381):

-- Connected urbanization -- argument was: ""a rising standard of living, more household appliances, and compulsory public education provided women with unprecedented leisure time which enable them to join wome's clubs or to enter the work force."" (381)

-- Some authors seemed to relate emancipation and family decline.  They didn't do it explicilty but wrote in a way that ""brough them together in the midn of the reader."" (381)

-- In terms of enfranchisement, historians ""portrayed post-1920 women as emancipated by the vote and by an urbanized, industrialized society, but choosing to remain for the most part in the home."" (385) But they did so without acknowledging discrimination.  (384-5)"

Wilenksy  she says ""foucses on both the acquisitin of systematic knowledge and a set of norm which guide the professional's behavior.""

"Back to Kant: the revival of Kantianism in German social and historical thought, 1860-1914","<p>Notes September 2014:</p>
<p>General comment:</p>
<p>Upon a quick reading of this book's intro and conclusion, what's going on here? Willey frames the book with the late nineteenth-century crisis of the self and crisis o fliberalism. He speaks of the shattering of the Crystal Palace and the emergence of Dostoevsky's Underground Man and Freuyd's libido. But he says there was a ""countertendency"" -- the ""revival of idealism,"" of which neo-Kantianism was the most important. By a revival of idealism, Willey means the following:</p>
<p>&gt; ""The aims of neo-idealism were to reassert the role of human consciousness in the historical process, to establish a methodology for humanistic studies different fro mthat of the physical sciences, and to defend the efficacy of moral striving in th epolitical arean against hte claims of economic determinism."" (9)</p>
<p>He puts neo-Kantianism in the broader context of efforts by people like T.H. Green in England and Jean Jaures in France. Key here he thinkw as an effor to ""bring liberalism and socialism into line with the new realities of mass industrial society in the closing decades of the century.""</p>
<p>This political context is key. Willey sees in neo-Kantianism a potentially useful philosophical movement that might have renewed a liberal individualism whilst also building a bridge to social democratic politics. So he's something like a centrist social democrat. The key context for his historical evaluation of neo-Kantianism&nbsp; seems to be this bridge. On the one hand, he defines neo-Kantianism in this way: ""</p>
<p>&gt; Neo-Kantianism careted an alliance of political sympathy between a handful of left-wing liberals and a number of socialist intellectuals who were dissatisfied with doctrinaire Marxism. It was a promising alliance, prefiguring in part the Weimar Coalition, and potentially capable of closing the chasm of mistrust between liberalism and social democracy."" (21)</p>
<p>But by the end of the book that promise of an alliance across liberal-left lines has failed. So the conclusion begins:</p>
<p>&gt; Marburg neo-Kantianism was politically important because it held out the possiblity of an intellectual alliance between liberal reformism and working-class socialism; obstianate prejudices on both sides, however, stood int he way. Prestiguous libearl reformers would hav had to dicard thier bias against the proletriat because of its lack of education and to assuage the bourgeois fear of social evolution. The working-class socialists, on the other hand, would have had to suppress revolutionary cant and to abandon the doctrine of class irreconciliabilty."" (179)</p>
<p>In the Preface, anyway, he blaims the failure to succed on the ""weakness of the German Reichstag under Bismark's constitution..."" (10). But in the conclusion,also, he seems to get at the inherent divides between liberal midddle class professors and working class socailists. This seems to me to be the key issue of the book anyway: why did it fail? And how Willey answers that will determine a lot about 1) his politics, and 2) the qualitiy of his analysis.</p>
<p>Increasingly, having read this, I suspet that Willey is a social democrat; and I thin the critique on the neo-Kantians he is willing ot entertain is that their philosophy was not strong enough to forge a political alliance with&nbsp; the working class, and that therefore it failed to estalvish the social democratic welfare capitalism that I think he think sis a basicly good&nbsp; thing, and which he says exists in Post-War Germany, see .eg. p. 103 in his commentary on the Marburg school. Here, for example, he says (in response to Mosse) that they failed to assess ""social, institutional, and cultural obstacles in their path..."" He means the Old Regime. And in a way that is slightly chilling in terms of the historical caclulus that he sees as turning out somethign good in the end he says : ""it took the Hitler period and the catastrophe of 1945 to reduce these obstacles to sufficiently to permit the rise of the broad social liberalism characteristic of the Federal Republic today."" (103)</p>
<p>## Preface</p>
<p>## 1. The Political and Intellectual Setting</p>
<p>* The 19th century was the century of the German middle-class' self-invention. Willey describes the nineteenth century as the ""age of the German bourgeoisie."" (13) He points to great thinkers like Einstein, Planck, Hisenberg, and Ranke. A period ending with Friedrich Nietzsche. It was he says a ""seculary Great Awakening of bourgeois talent."" But it created contradictory tendencies, and this is where neo-Kantianism begins to fit in. Because the ""same generation which celebrated Sadowa and SEdan and flocked to Bayreuth produced the Kantian revival with its critqiue of Hegelian metaphysics and its insistence on rational limits and moral values."" (14) It also produced Nietzsche, who was a sharp and rigorous critic of ""national hubris as exemplified by his one-time idol, Wagner."" (14)</p>
<p>* German middle-classes were also successful economically. Already conditions were set for economic success prior to 1848, with ""the establishment of the Customs Union, the mechanization of teiles an mining, the application of chemstry to agriculture, the development of internal transport, and the creation of credit facilities..."" (14) But in 1848 the political consciousness of the middle-classes shifted, revealing a ""lack of revolutionary realism and a myopic social vison on the part of the middle-class liberal."" (14) He also say sthat the economic vision expressed by bourgeois liberals at Frankfurt was ""largely self-serving"" and this ""derpvied them of masds uppport and destoryed the spontaneous revoultionary front of early spring."" (14)</p>
<p>* Willey notes that historians have argued that German libearals were not so narrowly l<em>aissez faire</em> as their British counterparts. There were fewer absuses he thinks in the factories, and German thought in Fichte, Hegel and List had experessed a more positive idea of hte state. Also because German liberalism developed in the context of ""princely and bureaucratic absolutism"" there was no real hostility to ""social welfare."" All these things made German libearlism a bit different, and between 1879 and 1889 the National Liberal party shifted from free trade and laissez-faire to protectionism and social welfare confirms this tendency. But he still thinks that German liberals stood close to Adam Smith. Their interest in regulation to end factory abuses was limited. They did not want to meddle with the Prussian decrees of September 7, 1811 and January 17, 1848 taht ""legalized"" laissez-faire. All this contributed to the rift between labor and liberalism, which caused the failure of the 1848 revolution, and then depeend in the 1860s. (14-15)</p>
<p>* It was this rift that had become ""of great concern to a group of neo-Kantian philosphers at the University of Marburg who attempted to&nbsp; close the ideological gap with a new kind of social iberalism basedd on the ethics of Kant."" (15)</p>
<p>* Contributing to this rift was the German middle classes ideology of classical humanism, ensconcsed in the notion of *Bildung*, and in their support of the monarchy. The point here is a complex one. Willey thinks that the liberal alliance with the monarchy were ""designed to justify middle-class recognition by and particiaption in government..."" (15) But he notes that the end-result was that ""social prejudice militated against success."" I think what he means is that the middle-calsses ended up seeing themselves as superior to the working-classes. This feeling deepened during the 1848 revolution, but also it was a product of the ideology of classical humanism. Such a standard, he notes, was ""well beyodn the reach of the lowerclasses; it was also irrelevant to their nees&nbsp; and interests."" (16) Ultimately, this ideology, which had begun in a reovlt against artistocratic absolutism, became instead a source of arrogance and the assumption that ""they were the exclusive agents of progress and universal rights."" (16) Expressive of this bias, was the fact that citizenship required ""Bildung und Besitz"" -- education and property. And this made German democracy much liek that shaped by the French Constituion of 1791 and the English Reform Bill of 1832. (16)</p>
<p>* From all this Willey concludes that the liberal drive for political opwer and influence did not match its drive for cultural success: ""while the middle class was acquiring property, culture, and knowledge to a remarkable degree, its drive for political influence commensurate with its wealth and education was faltering."" (16) The problem was that the party was anti-Democratic. So that when Weber and Friedrich Naumann for instance finally got to the democratic point of view, thye were ""already outflanked on both sides by the socailist and&nbsp; Catholic parties."" (16)</p>
<p>* Bismark was key here,a nd the liberal reaction to him. He was able to subordinate their political will. He realized their ""welath and talent"" were necessary for a strong Germany, but he was able to thwart their drive for political aparternship in representative institutions. (17). The liberals fo rtheir part were ""dazzled by the brillian vcitories of the Prussian army...[and thus] render ecstatic homate to blood and iron, indemnified the Prussian minister president, and therey traded liberty for unity and national power."" (17)</p>
<p>[ It strikes me that it is this that Boas was criticizing so extremely in his political statements in the late 1870s! This drive toward ""practical goals"" that he identified. ]</p>
<p>* Continuing this last point, Willey writes: ""What the liberals had sought for decades to achieve with their own resources was accomplished in a few weeks by the authoritarian state with its order, its army, and its discipline. The expression 'Now one sould accept the accomplished fact' (""Jetzt müsse man sich mit der vollendeten Tatsache abfinden""--according to Ziekursch , a slogan of the victorious hour) was by most accounts a fitting epitaph for German liberalism."" (17)</p>
<p>* Here Willey makes an interesting intervention vv the Sonderweg idea. The German liberals in being anti-democratic were not so different than other European liberals. The difference was the context: the ""dilemma of liberty and power did not present itself so starkly"" for other Euroepan liberals ""for to them national unity was a reality of long standing."" (18) That it wasn't in Germany, mean that for Germanliberals it was ""half a loaf or nothing"" (18). They could accept half a loaf and then ""look ahead to the prospect of agenuine parliamentatry and lawful state which he could now beging to develop within the new nation created on the field of battle."" (18) But that this ""evolution did not take place"" was Willey thinks a ""fault"" of this defensive social philosophy among Geramn liberals, just as much as it was a result of the ""much-criticized nationalistic trahison des clercs."" (18)</p>
<p>* Nonetheless, left-liberalism did not dissapear, even after the indemnity vote of Septbmer 3, 1866. This event was&nbsp; key shift in liberal attempts to start to work with Bismark, and no longer oppose his military budgts. The indemnity vote came after an election on the same day as the victory over Austria at the BAttle of Koeniggraetz on July 3, 1866, when liberal slost significant ground. The in the indemntiy vote Bismark retrocactively approved the military budgets from 1862 to 1866. But Progressives continued to fight, and under Eugen Richter ""vigorusly"" opposed Bismark. They reached aa new elcotral peak in 1881, when they brought 105 deputites, becoming the second largest party. In 1890, they had another brief resurgence. Also in 1912. So Progressives werenot dead after 1866. Rather, in the 1890s left-liberals had begunt o consider ""at least a tactical alliance with the socialists against Junderdom, autocracy, and big, business."" (18) This proccess culmianted in 1912 when the socialists became the largest party in the Reichstag because of assistance from left-liberasls. (18) But Willey says it was ""too late."" (18)</p>
<p>* The problem he thinks was that the Progressives feared democracy. They never opted for a political democracy but wanted a ""constitutional nation-state."" (19) E;.g. many progressives participated in the *Nationalverein*, which had begun in 1859 and were aimed at that producing German unity and consitiontual ity under Prussia. (19)</p>
<p>* There were a few that tried to preven tthe working-class liberal split. E.g. Leopold Sonnenmann, Ludwig Buechner, Ludwig Eckhardt, and neo-Kantian F.A. Lange. They wanted to ""unite labor with democratic elements of the middle class in common oppositn to social injsutice and the Prussian hegemony."" (19) But this didn't work. Most stuck to the ""petty bourgeois ...doctrine of *Selbsthilfe*..."" (20)</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>## 2. Back to Criticism: Rudolf Hermann Lotze</p>
<p>* Lotze was not in any clear sense a neo-Kantian, but his texts becaem important for the neo-Kantians. (40) He is not well-known today but he was very imporant and influential a tthe turn of the century, especially in the US&gt; George Santayana, Josia Royce, William James, etc. Protestant philosophers of the 1880s and 1890s found his work useful. Willey even says that by the 1870s that Lotze waws the most well-known scholar outside of Germany. (41)</p>
<p>* Lotze philsophical develo[ment too kplace ""between the classsical era of Goethe and Hegel and the rebirth of idealism in his own lifetime."" (41) Born May 21, 1817. His parents were civil servants around Dresden,. He went to Gymnasium in Zittau, near Bohemian border. (41-42)</p>
<p>* Lotze wrote a novel, with a characther named Lotha who Willey says was ""an idealized mirror of the author."" Lothar was a good example of Bildungsaristokratie, scornful of politics and of the ""common people."" (42) Lotze thus began from a very classist point of but as he developed his views changed slightly, so that at one point he could be described as expressing an ""'idealism fitted to democracy and industrial civilization'"" (42)</p>
<p>* In another novel, die Deutschen, he tries to express a metaphysical theory that he never abandoned, namely that there is a spirit in all things, naimate and inanmiate. (42)</p>
<p>* This foray into literature helped him forge the central themes of his philosophy. Nameyl, how could one reconcile metaphysical unity with a m echanistic view of nature? (43)&nbsp; This led him ""back to kant"":</p>
<p>&gt; His effort to harmonize metaphysical unity and moral idealism with the mechanical procesess of natured guided him back to the critical and practical philosophy of Kant -- pr pushed him forward to Kant, since he began with the metaphysics of Liebniz and Spinoza. (42)</p>
<p>* Lots was influenced by Fechner:</p>
<p>&gt; Lotze agreed with his Leipzig professor Gustav Fechner that all things possess spiritual pr properites and that God is the ultiamte consciousness of the universe. But he did not follow Fechner into his hteory of parallelsim between pscyhical and physical vents, which was his [Fechner's] solution to the mind-body problem and the problem of knowledge. (42)</p>
<p>* And also Fichte's notion of an ""ultimate moral principleexpressing itself in finite objects, and thus creating a teleological unity,"" which formed a part of his theory of value. (43)</p>
<p>* His thoery of value was his main ""bequest"" to the Baden neo-Kantians. (43)</p>
<p>* Christian Weisse was his first philosophical mentor at Leipzig, where Lotze began his studies in 1834.&nbsp; Weisse was a Hegelian. (43)</p>
<p>* He began a medical degree in 1838, but then in 1840 was accepted by the philosophy faculty at Leipzig in 1840. Hen then began work on his marjor work Metaphsik. (44)</p>
<p>* At Leipzig he was part of a elite academic cirlce that included Frechner, Salamon HIrzel, Weisse, The schumanns, and Mendelssohn. (44) This was ""German intellectual aristocracy in microcosm."" (44)</p>
<p>* In 1844 he goes to Fottingen to accept the chair of philosophy abandoned by Herbart. (44) This made sense given their shared pluralistic view of the unvierse. Infact, Lotze's ""pluralist view of the universe and his belief that the taks of philosophy is to find unity behind the manifold of experience wer indebted to Herbart's anti-Hegelian postulate that the world is compsed fundamentally of amny real things."" (44) Herbart's influence also explains the interest in Lucretius and Leibniz. (44)</p>
<p>* Lotze was pretty apolitical and during the 1848 revolution he in fact wanted to join a Free Corp that supported the regime! (44) So his reaction to 1848 was ""dour and pessimistic"" Willey says. He was more interested in working on a new edition of his book *Pathologie* and he turned down na offer to participate in a gvoernment reoganization committte.&nbsp; H ewrote that in Gotteingen ""Whenever possible the subject of politics is avoided."" (45) (44-45)</p>
<p>* Lotze was drawin into the Materialismusstreit that occcurred around the convention of naturla scientists in Goettingen in 1845, September. He surprised some given his mechanistic view, that he sided with the anti-materialists. He then became a favorite of anti-scientific people. After this he began to speak more and more in the language of ""philosophical criticism."" (45-46)</p>
<p>* In genearl the Materialismusstreit was important a key eearly stimulus for early neo-Kantainism, Willey argues, and it brought the ""problem of knowledge"" inot th elimelight, despite being possibly the nadir of German philosohy. (46)</p>
<p>* Lotze became somewhat political when during and after 1863, during Bismark's battle with the Prussian Diet, he chaffed a bit against the effect of Prussian politics on the university in Goettingen. He was not impresssed with some of the effects of Prussian organization. But he was able to make peace with the Prussian force utlimately. (46-47)</p>
<p>### Lotze on the Limtis of Conceptual Thought</p>
<p>* *Metaphysik* was his break with Hegelianism, and it set him apart fro his teach Weissse, establishing his Kantian orientation, i.e. toward ""epistemological criticism"" based on the ""foundations of Kant."" (48)</p>
<p>* Willey say sthat Lotze anticipated Windelband and Rickert in seeing 1) as he put it in Metaphysik ""the beginnings of metaphysics is not in itself but in ethics..."" (48), and 2) in seeing that although the ""unity of phenomena may e grasped in scientific ocncepts, that the ""true essence of being is the individual, the particular."" (48) The latter anticpated Windelband's division of science into genearlizing and individualizing methods. So this is a way o fthinking that of ourse alligns with what Iggers called the ""German conception of history"" -- i.e. from Ranke the notion that (against Hegel) ""the unfolding of history is not the exfoliation of an abstract Idea--this was Ranke's objection to Hegel--rather,it is the manifestation of the Diviine Personality in concrete meoments of real historical process."" (48) The historian in this conception has to search for that menaning in the finite pattern of events. (48)</p>
<p>* So this is an anti-Hegelian idealism of sorts. Lotze said that Hegels' error was to have ""identified thought with reality, and converted th erich, living world of concrete facts into a fixed system of abstract categories."" (48) I.e. Willey writes that Lotze and the Baden neo-Kantians believed that ""conceptual reason cannot be exhaustive; it cannot do justice to individuality or the richness of experience."" (48) Willey gives an example of this in a quote from Lotze from *Mirkokosmus*: ""What evertyhing is in itself, what its true nature is by which it exists...this may remain forever inaccessbille to thought."" And yet: ""[Idealism] believes that in nowning the import of what thus happens it possess all essential truth: that isi only for the realization of this truth that things exist."" (48-49) **Importantly, this idea cut both against materialists and the Hegelians: ""[Lotze] believed that the immediate, phenomenal world exists not for itself but for some purpose -- for something that ought to be. He used this doctrine against the panlogism of the Hegelians who, in his opnion, had said that all meaning and purpose are ventually relaizedin thought--and he also used it against those materilaists who denied taht realitis posssess any transcendent significance."" (49)</p>
<p>* Willey says that this tension between ""thought and things"" is key to Lotze. He argued that thought was inadequate for absolute certainty: ""thought, in the last resort, is tentative, and is debarred bythe frailty of human knowledge from the possibility fo arriving at absolute certainty."" (qquoted on 49). Willey links this to Kant's phrase in the *Critique of Pure REason* that he wanted to demolish thought to make room for faith. So for Lotze, faith was what was important: ""The spiritual link between purpose and necessity, between values and mechanical laws, is a personal God. Much like Kant, he set definite limits to cognitive knowledge, and assigned ultimate metaphysical questions to teh category of nescessary assumptions, regulative ideas, and faith."" (49)</p>
<p>* For Lotze, as a result of his desire to limit the hegemony of thought, it was utlimately experience and its irreducibility that became key for him. ""In the *Metaphysik* Lotze presented a strong case for immediate percepetion as opposed to the reduction of exprience in concepts. We are, he said, immediately aware that the content of consciousness is too rich to be exhausted in thought."" (49) He was aware that this was a dangerous position. In going this way, the philosophy opened up a situion in which the future dpeend on what he called the ""chained spirit of cirticism"" that could more easily destroy then reconstruct. And indeed he critiqued Kant for this too, for failing to build up a philosophy of immediate experience. But he too, Willey, says ended with a similar solution to Kant's, relying on practical reason as the only guide. (49-50)</p>
<p>[ more notes to be taken here on Lotze's views...]</p>
<p>## 3. Hegelian Manques: Kuno Fischer and Eduard Zeller</p>
<p>* Fischer and Zeller, Willey says, ""liberated philosophy from the old tradition of studying philosophical systems in a historical vacuum."" (58)</p>
<p>* Bio of Fischer from 59-62. Family was associated with Protestant church. Father was a minister. Mother a daughter of Prussian cavalry officer. (59)</p>
<p>* Willey sees a progress from Fischer and Lotze, through Windelband to Heinrich Rickerrt -- a line of ""descent that moved from belief in the immanent and irresistible progressn of the Hegelian Idea in history to a reasesertion of the individual consciousness and will in the form of Kantian and Fichtean voluntarism, a rebellion of individual personality against the seeming fatalism of Hegel."" (59) This Willey says was a ""protest of the bourgeois liberal spirit in Germany against historical passivity."" (59) And it&nbsp; was he thinks partly a response to the emergence of Prussian power...</p>
<p>* On 62-63, Willey describes a kind of ""network of relationships"" among the early neo-Kantians in which Fischer was involved. These inclued Strauss, the teacher of Eduard Zeller, Otto Liebmann, who Fischer befriended at Berlin. In 1872, Fischer left Jena for Heidelberg to fill a chair abandoned by Zeller, who had moved to Berlin. Berlin lured Lotze from Goettingen, suceeding in 1881. When Lotze died, Fischer was invited to Berlin, but he declined. etc etc..This is the network Wilely means, a series of ""informal associaitons""...</p>

But Kant went only halfway. It would still be necessary to destroy metaphysics completely. ""I believe that every metaphysics is a form of delusion, with only aesthetic or subjective justification.

He wrote a polemical work, Die Arbeiterfrage. Here his being a grandson of a peasant mule skinner meant, W thinks, that Lange did not feel ""constrained by the conventions of intellectual liberalism."" (91) In 1862 he clashed with the educational bureuacracy more intensely and he began to sound, W says, like an English Benthanmite. (91). i.e. local control of schools, society should be semi-autonomous assocaitions; state whould only have police power. etc. His model was English cooperative assocaitions and he started a cooperative assocation in Dusiburg based on this example in 1862. Looked forward to consumer cooperatives on Lousi Blanc's national work schop schemee. (91) He worried also about socialism's neglect of rural labor, and the creation of a what W calls a ""blue collar aristocracy."" (91) Because he liked cooperatives, he iked Hermann Schulze Delitzsch's work, but again critiqued the focus on the elite of labor at the expense of the *Lumbenproletariat*. (92) Nonetheless, his views were close enough to the socialists that he particiapted in the Arbeitervereine conferences in the early 1860s and had the respect of August Bebel and Marx and Engels, although they saw him W says as no more than a ""sympathetic bourgeois fellow-traveler but recognized that his introdcution of the urgnet social question to democractic circles was very important."" (92) In Oct 1864, he was a delegate to the convention o th German Arbeitervereine and was eelcted to tthe steering committe with Bebel, Hirsch, and Sonnemann. This W says happened during the perio dof ""cordial if short lived relations between socialist and democrats."" (92) He separated from the labor movement in 1866 but before that he spoke a great deal throughout the Ruhr valle and in these talks W says he singled otu the acceptance in germany of ""everything fromt he top."" (92) He wanted the labor mvomvent to ""assert its strength through its own economic and political institutions."" (92) </span></p>

First edition was propagandistic, by his own admission. Second edition was more thoughtful. He conducts an excursus of Malthus and Darwin in first chapter. The struggle for surival that Darwin described had been transmuted into industrial society, but at the same time people ahd lost the means of production. (93) So the worker can never rise above basic subsistence. ""Society"" he interpreted as a ""industrialized version of Darwinian nature"" that could only be improved by democratijc evolution and ""cooperative efforts of an independent proletariat."" (Willey's workds, 93) On the other hand, Willey explains that for Lange ""[c]onflict is not inherent in human relations; it is the pernciicous consequence of maldistributed political and economic power."" (93) That seems to be a contraadiction in a way with Lange's willingness to use the struggle for surivial of Darwin as a the basic frame. Willey doesn't go into this. (93) But the point seems to be that Lange believed that there was a historical process underwawy that would transcend conflict: ""Since the 1840s, rational and moral considerations ahd begun to mitigate the struggle. Either in fear of revolution or out of genuine sympathy the capitalist class wasgradually curbing the excesses of industrialism. Urban life itself, by bringing poeple of difference classes into closer contact with one another, was producing an empathy that cut across class lines. The social conscience of Western Euroep had been awakened. And the worker himself, through trade unions and cooperatives, was becoming self-reliant. The union movemet, as Laange accurately observed, had not made the proletariat more revolution but more conservative. The trade unions were an escape valve for class hostility, a source of working-class solidarity, and a constructive means of improve the worker's lot."" (93) He was, in other words, looking forward to a ""equaitable worker's capitalism"" as Willey puts it (94), that would grow out of cooperatives and credit unions. He didn't think you could abolish private property on the small scale, but you could on th elarge scale increase ""social proeprty"" (Willye's phrase, 94). Willey quotes, presumably Lange, in saying that his vision of social progress would ""enrage the Marxists and please the pragmatists."" (94) Willey compares him to the French ""possibilitsts"". I.e. firs tworkers acquire political influence, then they organize cooperatives, then they break up herditary property rights, et c etc.Interestingly he rejected Locke in Kantian terms, rejecting it on the the idea that ""the freedom of one should not diminist the freedom of others."" (94) And the utlimate goal here was to encourage the unfolding of the self's full capacities in th way that Bildung indicates. But in this sense, he treated Bildung as a ""social ideal"" Willey says, and not as a ""prerequeisit for political activity"" as was the case for many German liberals. (94) He remained skeptical of Bismark's policies because o fhis indvidualism, writing in 1865 in the *Landbote*: ""Germany must be free and unified; however, a unity in which freedom is oppressed and despotic military government is introduced is not progress but the greatest of conceivable dangers."" (quoted on 94) By the 1870s, though, Willey says that Lange had tired of fighting politics in writing. (94-95) Ultimately, Willey says that Lange moved from being a liberal to a social democrat, but in doing so he held onto his 1) individualism and 2) hostility to revolution. (95) </span></p>

What was materialism in Germany? It became the ""philosophical persuasion"" of ""democratic intellectuals,"" W says, in 1848. and then came under criticism in the 1850s by ""those who found it an inadequate basis for science or politics."" (95) So before Lange wrote, people like Buechner, Moleschott had ""denied the independence of consciousness from matter, of mind from the physical processes of the body."" (95-96) This was the ""struggle for the soul."" (96) And it began first in public at the Goettingen convention of natural scientists in 1854, and had become less important by 1860, because people like Liebig, Helmholtz, and Lotze ""had repudiated the rather primitive materalism of Buechner and his associates."" (96) So the value of the materialist debate was that it called attention to the limits of science and cut against crude scientism. Kant was therefore useful because he could be pitted against this crude materialism. Kant ""argued that our scientific knowledge is limited by the modes of perception which determine the form of sensuous experience. Our minds work in conjunction with sensuous experience, but th emodes of percepti9on are a priori."" (96) Willey then puts the value of Kant for the anti-materialist cause very clearly: his concept of pure reason was valuable ""becaue it preserved the autonomy of consciousnss, while neither making ungrounded metaphysical claims for its powers nor denying the indispensability of experience."" (96) Now Lange followed Helmholtz in to his critique. He had heard Helmholtza at Bonn in 1857. Lange believed that materialists had not explained consciousness. Lange thought that modern psychology and physiology had ""shown that the world investigated by physical scientists is a world that depends on our perceptions; it does not have an independent existence -- nor is the observer a mere reflector of it."" (96) So W says Lange's objection was epistemological and not spiritual or religious. That is key! (96) But Lange did not want to fall from materialism into skeptcism. Thus, although Kant was good for attacking materialism, he was less good in generating an enduring system: hence the ""neo"" Kantianism. Lange and others wanted to regenrate Kantian criticism for a new project, and the source of new energe for Lange and other early neo-Kantians came from what Willey calls their ""psychologism"": their belief that recent discovries in the nature of the sense organs had in Lange's terms ""develoepd or corrected Kantianism."" (97) So this ""hard turn"" shows that neo-Kantianism, in it early phase, was a revolt against ""scientism"" bu tnot against science Willey points out. (97) In Lange';s history he dated the end of idealism and the beginning of materailism in Germany to the July Revolution in France. That was the moment that as Lange put it: ""philosophy lost its magic the moment it was palced in the service of absolutism."" He saw Heine's migration to Paris as symptomatic of the situation after 1830. (97) Lange also blamed Hegel and his left-wing disciples for materialism's problems. Willey writes: ""Hegel had confused reality with its manner of appearing to us; then Ludgwig Feuerbach transformed Hegel's identity principle into quasi-materialism with his equation, 'truth, equality, and sense are identitical.'"" So Feuerbach ets equated ""sensibility with reality..."" This was an ""anthropocentric modification of Hegel"" that could be used to attack religious and secular authority, Willeysays. [Note: it's very hard to see here where Laange's analsysis ends and Willey's starts]. Then Arnold Ruge's *Hallische Jahrbuecher* formed these radical Hegelian ideas into a ""weapon of political opposition."" (98) Basically, all these moves ignored, from Lange's point of view, what Willey calls the ""phenomenal nature of experience"" that Kant had demosntrated. Reality is forever inaccessible etc etc. But the point here is that because this materilist turn came also from the Hegelian/idealist side, which ran so deep in Germany, Lange was attacking both the materialists and the Hegelians. One had to resist the anthropocentric humanism of the materialists, and the metaphysical absolutism of the Hegelians. (98-99)</span></p>

In line with his desire to resist both materialism and metaphysical absolutism, Lange did not trust the idea of moral absolutism or that there was a way to reach a scientific foundation for ethics. So he had to downplay or he did not know well those latter work of Kant in the send and third critqiues, where as Willey puts it ""the limtis of theoretical reason are surpassed by moral and aesthetic judgement."" (99) How did Lange see Kant? Willey says he saw him as ""a demolisher of dogmatic metaphysics, of Humean skepticism, and as a fideist in morality and religious beliefs."" (99) He liked Kant the empiricisit still. Willey describes Lang'e smoral philosopy as a ""mixture of eudaemonism and teleological idealism with a voluntaristic twist typical of early neo-Kantian ethical philosophy. It's somehow the voluntarism that is key for Willey. He says that Lange's moral philosp[hy was ""designed to inspire practical action."" (100) </span></p>

(102) They hewed more closely to Kant and were less enthusiastic positivists. But they retained Lange's democratic socialism, and the goal of getting the working class interested in neo-Kantian politics. There was a turn here, though, back toward ""transcendental critique.""

I.e. the ""apogee of Marburg neo-Kantianism unfortunately coincided with Wilhelmine *Weltpolitik*, the Pan-German movement, the rise of gian industry, the spread of fashioanble irarationalism, and the erractic diplomacy of Bismark's successors.

In moral questions. than the Marburg philsophers. They were less interested in epistemologijcal criticism. The division can be drawn too starkly, though, Willey says. The Marburg philosophers were also interested i n ethics. And the Baden philsophers were interested in logic, but as it related to history and to the humanities. Thus: ""they differed from the Cohen group in their greater intereste in a critical philosphy of values for the understanding of history rather than in the logical structure of the natural sciences, bua greed that there was a conceptual division of reality and purpose, or Being and Values, and that reality and purpose unite in moral action.""

As opponents of historicism , Windelband and Rickert sought the universal nature of values, while Stammler looked for the universal nature of law. This was a reutrn to the mode, not the substance, of natural law thinking characteristic of eighteenth-century Enlightenment. The Baden philosophers wrote extensively on the signifiacne of individuality in history--a strait of Romatnic historiography-- but basically they were rationalists. They wanted to find the univerasl value represtend in each unique historical event; therefore, Baden neo-Kantianism was inherently ihumnanistic and universal. (133) </span></p>

<p>### 7. Individuality, Society and Humanity</p>
<p>* This chapter is key in terms of the overall historical questions taht Willey wants to deal with. The point is that that the German state had by the end of the century been established, but this consolidation of power had revealed the state to be frequently amoral and often to involve ethically questionable expediencies and compromises. The old idealist notion of Hegel that the ""Immanent Reason"" would be revealed in the state, and that the state would express both power and liberalism unified, had fallen away, but the succesful consoldiation of the German state had raised a new problem: namely that the ""actual power"" of the state raised this tension between the ""ethical absolutes of German idealism"" and the demands of actual power in an amoral world. This was the old Kantian question, the tension between practical and theoretical reason. And the neo-Kantians were in a good position to analyze it, Willey wants to say, but they faced serious challenges: especially, the power of the state itself, but also the political awakening of the masses. Would their philosophical system become just a defense of bourgeois right -- as the Marxists' susepcted -- or would it be able to build a real progressive force? There was a failure, that much Willey admits, in 1930!! (154) But he thinks this was not predetermined and he thinks that the neo-Kantians were positioned to help. Their influecne was felt strongly after 1890. There was a massive increase in interest in Kant, marked by the coming into existence of journals like the *Kant-Studien* or *Logos*. (155-156). But this fad of Kant was not always about libearlism: some read Kant as a defnse of mindless bureaucratic and miltiaristic obedience, e.g. Eichmann quoted Kant in his trial! (156)</p>
<p>* Troeltsch, Weber, and Meinecke were all influenced by the neo-Kantians, by the problem of the tension between relativism in history and permanent or universal values. They were haunted by these questions. Troeltsch appreciated Rickert's attempt to bridge the gap between the historicist-relativist apprecition of individualities, and universal history and rational principle, but he thought he failed. See quote on 159. He thought that the historian was stuck with immanent analysis and he couldn't accept Rickert's transcendental critique. He thought that Rickert's attempt to reach rational principles in history ended up smothering individuality and immanence, and he ultimately preserved an interest in immanence. During the wary, although he was less nationalistic than the likes of Paul Natorp and other supporters of the ""Ideas of 1914"", he was concerned that the ""special virtues of German life"" would be overrun, and so he proposed a central European confederation consisting of Germany, the Danubian monarchy and its sattelites as a bulwark against the West. (160). Weber was also inspired by Rickert and the neo-Kantians, and by Simmel as well. But his goal was ""value free inquiry"" and so made much of Rickerts' separation of the two domains of science: history and natural cience. He thought it possible to characterize values as a historian, without judging them. And this critique was directed in part at Natorp and others who were using their position as Professors to ""preach Germany's cultural mission"" as Willey puts it. ( 164) The comment he directed at them, quoted on 163, was: ""I hold that a lecture is different than a speech."" (163). I.e. Natorp et al were giving ""speeches,"" mixing their subjective value judgement with the representation of the role of values in history. ( 161-165)</p>

Anthropology and Antihumanism in Imperial Germany,"p.01-3 Humanism and ""The Other""

Zimmerman notes that the humanities in Germany (=Geisteswissenschaften)
had been informed by imperialism.  ""For Hegel, Franke, and the ensuing tradition of historicism, the subject of humanistic knowledge was identified as European through the self-consscious exclusion of Africans, Asians, and others.  The goal of history, for both Hegel and Ranke, was self-knowledge, and the self was defined in Manichean ethnic  terms.  The paradox of non-Europeans for the European human sciences -- a paradox that dated back at least ot sixteenth-century debates about the inhabitants of the Americas or perhaps even to Aristotle's theorizing about slavery -- was that they were human yet could not be acknowledged as possessing full 'humanity.'    Humanists notions of the self were both defined and profoundly threatened by the extinction of humans whom Europeans regarded as inferior.  A number of scholars have recently shown how this very notion of a European self was worked on in the colonies so that the 'self' of humanism and the 'other' of imperialism were twin births.  For all its provincialism, German humanism was, from the beginning, a global discourse that made sense of the colonial enounter by defining a European self unaffected by it."" (2-3)  

The books he quotes in relation to the working out of the humanisitc self in realtion to imperialism's other are: Cooper and Stoler, eds., Tensions of Empire: Colonial Cultures in a Bourgeois Wrold (1997); Mary Louise Pratt, Imperial Eyes: Travel Writing and Transcultuation (1992); Ann Sstoler, Race and the Eeducation of Desire: Foucault's History of SExuality and the Colonial Order of Things (1995); Gauri Viwanathan, Masks of Conquest: Literary Study and British Rule in India (1989)."

One of the central points in this article, as referred to in Freedman's article ""The New Woman: Changing Views of Women in the 1920s"" (1974), was to destruct the idea that the revolution sexual morals that many saw in the 1920s, was really accomplished in the 1920s.

The Making of a Feminine Professional Identity: Social Workers in the 1920s,"p. 1057-1058 Failure to Provide Status & Autonomy.

Professionalism promised status & autonomy.  Walkowitz thinks their record was mixed on this.  

Status: ""Status came from the social worker's position of authority over lower-class clients, who were dependent on her judgement.  To her middle-class peers, however, the lower-class background of such clients minimized the status of social work."" (1058) 

Autonomy: After WWI ""many city agencies consolidated and centralized social services in organizations like the Community Chest and the Federation for Jewish Philanthropies. Administrators and board officers endorsed rationalization--specialized assignments with supervision, casework procedures, and stadardized report forms--as improvements in work. "" (1058)
At the Jewish Board of Guardians in NYC an affiliate of the Federation for Jewish Philanthropies ""the most highly trained professional staffs, bore the brunt of the increased rationalization."" (1058) 

Walkowitz argues that despite the argument f Sharon Hartman Strom that rationalization may ultimately have been to advantage of empoloyees b/c it minimized ""abitrariness"" and defined jobs (1058), that nobody liked it.  And in fact ""social workers complained of overwork and condemened their jobs as dependent and routinized.  In annual reports, the JBG executives, who were themselves usually trained social workers, confirmed what caseworkers experienced every day: high case loads and low salaries persistently undermined professional achievment."" (1058) 

In f.n.# 24  Walkowitz has an oustanding quote by Harold Silver of the Jewish School of Social Work regarding this feeling of being routinzed in 1929. 

Men were often given preference within the profession over women for ""privileged aminitrative positions. (1059)

Women also increasingly had to defer to men with medical jobs such as doctors or psychiatrists. (1059)"

<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /><br /></p>
<p>* World is undergoing a crisis: ""We live in a moment of accelerating crisis that is characterised by the shortage of long-term thinking."" (1)</p>
<p>* They are basically advocating for ""thinking about the past in order to see the future..."" (4)</p>
<p>* The way humanities appears irrelevant to power and policy problems leading to a sense of ""crisis"" in the humanities: ""The humanities can appear 'soft' and indistinct in their findings compared to the so-called 'hard' sciences. they can seem to be a luxury, even an indulgence, in contrast to disciplines oriented totowards professional careers, like economics or law. They rarely compete in the push to recruit high-profit relationships with software, engineering, and pharmaceutical clientele. And they can be vulnerable to new technologies that might render the humantiees' distinctive methods, such as close reading of texts, an apprecaition for abstract values. and the promotion of critical thinking over instrumental reasoning jejune. The humanities are incidental (not instrumental), obscolescent (not effervescent), increasingly culnerable&nbsp; (nto technologically adaptable) -- or so their enemies and sceptics would have us believe."" (6)</p>
<p>* Way to address this they think is to be creative basically, and to draw on history. ""Indeed, in a crisis of short-termism, our world needs somewhere to turn to for information about the relationship between the past and the future. Our argument is that History -- the discipline and its subject-matter -- can be just the arbiter we need at this critical time."" (7)</p>
<p>* They talk about the ""compression of time in historical work"" -- most dissertations between 1975 and 2005 focused on at most a 50 year period of time. In 1900, the average number of years covered in a diss was 75; in 1975, closer to 30. They link this to a process whtouhg which ""professional historians ceded the task of synthesising historical knowledge to unaccredited writers and simultaneously lost whatever influence they might once have had ove rpolicy to colleagues it nhe social sciences, most spectactularly economists.""

<p>* But this is changing the authors say. There is now ""an expanding universe of historical horizons, from the 'deep history' of the human past, stretching over 40,000 years, to 'big history' going back to the ig Bang, 13.8 millsion years ago. Across many fields of history, big is definitely back."" (8)</p>
<p>* Importantly, they link this as well to the ""rise of big data and problems such as long-term climate change, governanace, and inequality..."" (9) And they site a new ""sense of responsibility""&nbsp; and they urge a sense, quoting Richard Drayton from an article ""Imperial History and the HUman Future"" that ""how they [historians] tell the story of the past shapes how the presnet udnerstands its potential, and isthus an intervention in the future of the world"" (9)</p>
<p>* The say that none of this is new and site the <em>longue durree</em> ofFernand Braudel. But this is not the same as that. ""The new <em>longue duree</em> has emerged within a very different ecosystem of intellectual alternaties. It possesses a dynamism and flexibility earlier versions did not have. It has a new relationship to the abounding sources of big data available in our time -- data ecological, governmental, economic, and cultural in nature, moch of it newly available ot the ens of digital analysis.""

<p><strong> Big Questions, Big data</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>* Section talking about how historians are trained to analyze data in a particularly useful way and should take the lead in the ""arbitration of data"" (107)</p>
<p>* In particular, historians are good at ""noticing instituitonal bias in the data, thinking about where data come from, comparing data of different kinds, resisting the powerful pull of received mythology, and understanding that there are different kinds of causes."" (108)</p>
<p>* ""Historians are trained to look at various kinds of data, even when they come from radically different sources. These are skills that are often overlooked in the training of other kinds of analysts; the reading of temporally generated sequences of hterogenous data is a historian's speciality."" (108)</p>
<p>* He is talking about a shift to long duree that would be able to integrate lots of different forms about big data, large-scale cultural change, grand-scale trade evidence, mimgration &amp; displacement, biodiversity data, etc. (111-112)</p>
<p>* This means investment in certain kinds of tools: ""We should invest in tools and forms of analysis that look critically at big data from multiple sources about the history and future of our institutions and societies."" (112)</p>
<p>* Taking this role, they think, might mean that historians have to ""take a more active role in the many public institutions that govern the data about our past and future..."" (112)</p>
<p>* The new role of the historians that embrace big data: ""If historians -- or any other historically minded scholars, from sutdents of literature to sociologists -- take up this challenge, they may find thsemlves in the avant grade of information design. They could collaborate with archivists, data scientists, economists and climate scientists in the curating of larger and more synthetic database for studying change over time. In the future, historians' expertise could be sought out in sectors beyond the university. Historians may become tool-builders and tool-reviewers as well as tool-consumers and tool-teachers. Indeed, these changes have the potential to revolutionisse the life of some professional historains, as faculty provide data analysis for legislative committees, advicse activist campaigns, or consult with Silicon Valley startups, and thereby regain the public role they traditionally cocupied and deserve once more to regain...""

<p>* These digital projects might entail. Analyses of data that make ""interventions"" into single-historian produced histories. That they also can ""overlay"" data from multiple sources -- economic, emographic, political, and intellectual...(114)</p>

The Intellectual Legacy of  George Herbert Mead,"<p>General Notes</p>
<p>* He makes the claim that Mead's work is not easily undertood because he neve rpublished a book.&nbsp; Apparently, the book we have is a compliation of his lectures, put together posthumously.&nbsp; He cites works by Hans Joas, Gary Cook, David Miller, Israel Scheffler, John Baldwin, and Mitchell Boulafia that is important fo r understanding.&nbsp; (207-208).&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Mead was born 27 Feb 1963 in South Hadley, MA.&nbsp; His father, ReverendHiram Mead, was a Professor of Homiletics at Oberlin College.&nbsp; His mother, Elizbeth Storrs Mead, was educated in a seminary and worked as a schoolteacher.&nbsp; Little is known about his childhood.&nbsp; More is known about his early college years at Oberlin.&nbsp; Oberlin at the time, Hannan says, ""offered the sort of liberal arts programme typical of American colleges then under the suffocating and represesive spell of the Church."" (209)&nbsp; But Mead and his friend Henry Castle Albert Mead, questioned Christian belief.&nbsp; They studied with the common senseea realits James Faircdhild and John M. Ellis to explore Christian ideas and also to question those ideas.&nbsp; After college, Mead took a job in 1883 teaching at a grade school in Berlin Heights, Ohio.&nbsp; He was studying Kant's Critique of Pure REason and the Prolegomna to Any Future Metaphysics.&nbsp; And he began to think about going to Germany.&nbsp; He took more jobs first ofr the Wisconsin Railroad and then working as a tutor.&nbsp; In 1885 he learned taht Castle had gone to Berlin and he became more ambitious.&nbsp; He decided to study philosophy at Harvard.&nbsp; Joas thinks that Mead was attracted to Harvard becauseit was more liberal.&nbsp; (210)&nbsp; He was interested in Josia Royce.&nbsp; He did not study with William James but was a tutor to James' students and so go to know him that way.&nbsp; IN 1888, he went to Germany, and enrolled at the University of Leipzig.&nbsp; Mead studied with Wundt who had set oup a psychology program at Leipzig.&nbsp; In 1889, he transferred to U of Berlin.&nbsp; He studied more philosphy and psychology. (211).&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Hannan mentions importantly, although too briefly, that Mead wanted to reformulate Kant's epistemology because he believed that Kant had ""drawn a false distinction between space as 'a form of sensibility' and space as 'a construction of our eye and hand and ear.'"" (211) He worked on this problem in his dissertation which was supervised by Dilthey!! This seems key because basically it shows a similar desire to revisit the epistmelogical distinctions Kant made by thinking about the organic basis (eyes and ears) of pscyhological awarness of an external reality (idea about space).&nbsp; (211)</p>
<p>* Mead takes up a teaching post at Ann Arbor in autumn 1891.&nbsp; There he meets John Dewey, but also Alfred Lloyd and Chrles H. Cooley!&nbsp; Hannan writes: ""Cooley had himself been influenced by Adam Smith's notion of the looking-glass self, according to which a buyer in the marketplace sees him or herlsef throught the eyes of the seller, while the seller, likewise, sees him or herself through the eyes of the buyer."" (212)&nbsp; Cooley described this as ""sympathetic imagination."" (212).&nbsp; Apparently, from Cooley, Mead was influenced to start thinking about ""language and the self"" as things that ""arise from social interaction."" (212)&nbsp; Dewey and Lloyd were still at the time working within a Hegelian frame, but Dewey had already begun his shift away from Hegelianism, and picking up on psychological functionanlism.&nbsp; Hannan mentions his ""Reflex Arc"" article.&nbsp; (212)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* In 1894, Dewey was offered a position at Chicago, and he accepted on the condition that Mead would be given a postiion too.&nbsp; It was at Chicago that Mead developed his ""social psychology, his theory of self, his ideas for social and educational reform, and, eventually, his moral theory."" (213)</p>
<p>* First key development in his thinkin g at Chicago was ""his synthesis of Hegelianism and progressivism."" (213)&nbsp; He critiqued Hegelianism in an article in 1901 entitled ""A New Criticism of Hegelianism: Is it valid?"".&nbsp; His poit was that Hegel's thought was being mis interpreted by people attempting to bring to ""consciousness the <em>form </em>in which essential problems present themselves and the <em>form</em>which their solution must take."" (quoted on 213).&nbsp; What Mead insisted is that the task of philosphy was to discover the dialectic process in ""practical situations"". ie, he though the process of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis was evident in the working out of problems, and most importantly in the activity of the self, which, Hannan writes, ""is perpetually engaged in the process of a creative overcoming of contradictory objects of thougth and desire."" (214)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Hannan argues (in what seems to me to be an unclea rstatement) that Mead&nbsp; saw himself as ""develping a scientific approach to social reform.""&nbsp; And that he believed that ""all social problems were amenable to scientififc solutions."" (214) Mead he says worked on the idea that the social realm, like the physical realm is governed by laws, but he also wa convinced that human behavior was dialectical in nature.&nbsp; I cna't quite follow Hannan here, and I suspect his language is off, but he writes of an article by Hannan called ""The Working Hypothesis in Social Reform"" from 1899 that ""Mead argued in favour of laws that establish the conditions for the free reign of dialectical interchange and opposed laws that mistakenly sought to determine the outcome of social relations."" (214)&nbsp; Hannan's point is that in his ""scientific"" outlook on social life, Mead ""opposed fixed programmes and solutions that do not permit creative growth and discovery."" (214)&nbsp; He like science because of it's open-ended methodology of inquiry, a bit like Charles Peirce it seems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Dewey said that Mead's initial ""haunting question.""&nbsp;</p>"
A Social History of Anthropology in the United States,"p.051-52 Continued small ness of Anth

One reason it was still ""small"" and not ""centralized"" was the persistence of
local or regional anth. societies that challenged hegemony of Washington
Anths and Boas.  E.g. Edgar Lee Hewett who founded the Archaeological society of New Mexico in 1898 and became a spokesman of arcchaeology in the West.  Hewett succeeeded when a bill of his went oup agianst a bill backed by the Smithsonian, the AAA and the Arhchaeological Inst of America, and Hewett's won with the help partly of Charles Lummisof LA who was politically powerful.  (51)   Hewett also lobbied the Arch. Insitutte of American to establish a School of American Aracheology in Santa Fe, himselfas director.  1907 he launched a field school attended by Harvard students Alfred Kidder and Sylvanus Morley who late bcame prominent.  By 1910 Hewett consolidated his influence and could counter the arguments and criticism of others.  E.g. in 1990 Putnam,, Boas and Bowditch took criticisms to annual meeting of the Archeological Institute of American and lost.  Hewitt's programs took money that boas wanted for his international school in Mexico.  (51)  Hewett also attacked Boas's integrity apparently in 1910.  (52)"

He was close to her throughout his life. Attempted to write poetry first, but left it. Was fascinated by math. Considered attending Ecole Polytechnique. But ended up stdying the less demanding law. 1869-1894 he held regional court posts around Sarlat. He read a lot. Read Spencer, where he discovered the ""analogical thinking"" that tried to discern general principles underlying different domains. From Hegel, he learneda bout dialetic. And John Sutart Mill provided a model of logic and science. He married in 1877, Mlle Marthe Bardy -Delisle, daugheter of a mgistrate. Had three kids. Became interested in crim and Italian criminiologists. Published articles criticizing the Italian school. This became his first book: *La criminalite comparee*, which established him as a leading criminologist. He published in 1890 Les Lois de l'imitation, the laws of imitation. In 1894, he was named director of criminal statistics at the Ministry of Justice in Paris. In 1890s he was frequently in Paris and asked to lecture a great deal. No sociology taught in Paris unil 1902, Clark says, when Durkheim was called from Bordeaux, but there was a lot of interest in ""social issues,"" and this is what Tarde was asked to lecture on. He was asked to teach a course every two years at Ecole Libre des Science POlitiques. Thjese ultimately bcaeme Les tranofrmations du pouvoir (1899). In 1899, eh tried to presnet his candidacy for a chair in modern philosopy at the College de France, recently vacated by Nourrisson, but it did not work. But he was then appointed in 1900 over Henri Bergoson. He died, however, in 1902. (2-6)</p>

<p style=""-qt-block-indent: 0; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">* Clark says that Durkheim and Tarde represent the influence of two competing traditions in France. Durkheim represents ""Cartestianism"", identified with ""reason, order, and authority, and housed in the bureaucratic institutions exemplifying this esprit de geometrie: the church, the governmental administration, the army, and the state university system."" The bouregoisie after the Revolution and under Napolean had raised this orientation quasi-official ideology. But it was with the ""creation of the Third Republic after 1870 that assured the ascendancy of the Cartesian mentality..."" (8) On the flip side, was the mentality of Spontaneity: the ""mentality of artistic reation, romantic subjectivism, and personal invention guided by an *esprit de finesse*."" (8) ""As the bourgeoisie and Cartesianism came to be more and more identifyed with the established instiuttions in the last part of the nineteenth century, their opponents grew increasingly anti-bourgeois, antiinstiutitonal, anticollective, and, occassionally, revolutionary. Aesthetic, oplitical, and economic attacks were fused in antibourgeois ideologies put forth by the heirs of the traditional nobility, the rural peasantry, or the urban proletariat. Against bourgeois republicn ideologues Renouver and Littre, and parliamentary leaders Cleamenceau and Combes, wer ethe champions of Spontaneity of the left--the anarachists, anarcho-syndicalists, and certain socialists--complemented by the advocates of Spontaneity of the right--the romantic nationalists. Ocassionally, when anti-bourgeois sentiments grew sufficeintly strong, and social ties sufficiently weak, individuals could move from Spontaneity of the left to that of the right without excessive difficulty. The most outstanding example was the theoretician of orgiastic violence, Georges Sorel, who, from an intellectual leader of anarcho-syndicalism, became an esteemed guide fo the Actio Francaise and eventually for fascism."" (8-9) In terms of schools, Ecole Polytechnique was the home of Carteianism, opposed by the Sorbonne where Spontaneity found a voice. It's major spokesman Victor Cousin. (9) This was true fo the Sorbonne until the demise of the Second Empire, which was seen Clark says as a ""defeat for loose living and unsystematic thinking,"" and the ""new University"" was remade in ways that excluded the likes of Victor Cousin, and the reformers tried to emobody the ideals of Cometean positivism, patterning the institutions also after the German research-oriented universities. This happened 1880s and 1890s. Durkheim was the r guy here. Clark writes in Durkheim these reformers ""felt t that they had found the man who could best extend the mentality and methods of Cartesianism to the study of society."" (10) His work fit perfectly to the idoelogical deamnds of the differnet parts of society, Clark says,: ""to the anticlericals he contributed a philosophical basis for a secular morality to replace the earlier Catholic dogmas; to the radical and radical socialist politicians of 'solidarity,' he offered a more systematic grounding for their political philosophy; for the Dreyfusards he provided coherent intellectual guidance."" (10) At the Sorbonne, Durkheim came into close contact ith the Minsitry of Education and became ""one fo the most powerful university politicains in France."" (10) Tarde by contrast had been exose to a more Spontaneous tradition after his own negative reaction to the Cartesian aspect of the Jesuits, at Tolouse and and the Paris Faculties of Law. These places had students who were not radicals but social prominent you men who still glorified the ideology of Spontaneity. He was exosed at College de France to philosophers like Paul Janet, who had apparently made Durkehim delete a chapter form his thesis that was complimentary about Comte, and Jean Zoulet, who was much opposed to the teaching of Durkheim in France's Normal schools, seeing it a ""national peril."" (see quote on 10). The successor of Tarde at College was Henri Bergson, who Clark says is the apotheosis of the Spontaneous tradition. (11) And TArde's son, Alfred de Trade, a law student, also became very negative about Durkehim. (11)</p>

<p style=""-qt-block-indent: 0; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">* Clark then goes through Durkheim and Tarde's similarities because they did not oppose each other on every level. In fact, Clark says that Tarde and Durkheim held a whole set of common beliefs about social science. They both recognized: 1) certain key antecedents for sociology, e.g. Montesquieu, Comte, Quetetlet, and Spencer. So they agreed on some common historical roots for the discipline. And this set them apart from French social statisticians fo the time and the disciples of Le Play who would not have agreed. (12) 2) They agreed in what Clark calls their ""taxonomies of sociological work"", i.e. on the relationship of certain kinds of labor. Both saw colleting data as the loest level and they admitted an eclectic range of data, including ethnographic materials, personal doucuments, legal reecords, government statistics, research-collected data. They believed that meaningful analysis could only come from the specialization of individuals and narrow topics, i.e. on religion, law, the family, the economy, and so on. This allowed for close attention to empirical data. But they also believed that induction itself was not sufficeient. This work just provided a basis for a more general conceptual framework, and so Clark says they resisted what he sees as the German sociologists tendency to ignore theory. (12-13) 3) Their ""logic of analysis"" (13). Both drew on J.S. Mill heavily for certain ""rules of investigation..."" that highlighted the importance of comparative analysis. (13-14) They both tended to work by examining multiple explanations for a given phenomeona and then drawing out the valid pieces from each. (14) 4) Both rejected utilitarian theory and the assumption that accompanied it that ""society consisted of an aggregate of atomistic individuals..."" (14)</p>

<p style=""-qt-block-indent: 0; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;"">* Divergence: Tarde believed that ""a prerequisitie for any science was the reptition of some basic measurable phenomenon."" (15) Art in his view focused on the indivdiuality of phenomena; science must focus on generalization based on repetetive phenomena. But social science in focusing on the social must be distinguished its subject from biology and psychology: what was left for Tarde, Clark says, was the ""inter-mental"" (16) And: ""The basic process by which this inter-mental influence takes palce, and the basic social fact for sociology, Tarde holds, is imitation. Social relations are essential imitative relationships."" (16) He also believe dthat there were two basic forms of imitation: the cognitive, which was related to belief, and the emotoinal, which is related to desire. (16) ""The final result of imitation for the indiviudal is a 'mental imprint,' an impression on the mind similar to the imprint on a photographic plate. Thus, psychology cannot be excluded fro sociology as social processes consist, in the final analysis, of inter-mental relations."" (16) **Durkheim, however,** believed that the social fact was not something imitated but rather something that was ""exterior"" to the individual, something imposed, a constraint. (16) He also rejected pscyhology as a necessary basis for sociological analysis. (16) That is, for Durkheim to some extent the social was osmething completely outside of all its members. For Tarde this was absurd and it implied another version of the ""scholastic ontology"", i.e that if you were to remove all the individuals of a group, the social characteristics would somehow remain. (18) Tarde apparently referred to this as Durkheim's ""ontological Phantasmagoria"" (!!). (17) Clark tries to balance these two ponts of view diplomatically, ssaying that Durkheim did sometimes move to far toward this kind of ontological error; while although in Clarke's view Tarde had a ""more sophisticated view of the relationship bewteen the individual and society,"" he ""underestimated the importance of certain collective influences.""

(18) Tarde focused on the ""centrality fo the creative individual in suggestiing new lines of development which the collectivity would subsequently adopt"" and Durkheim on the ""structural conditions which predisoposed a given collectivity to change...""

Addams who was a friend of Thomas' and Geddes' ""gave popular expression to their psychological analyses in <i>Democrayc and Social Ethics</i> , arguing that ssocial progress depended on the moral insights of women."" (41)   Addams thought that women's interest in public activity was a result not of a ""wish for a career or selfish fulfilment"" (Rosenberg, 41) but a product of the fact that in the industrialized world the family was less important.  Thus in pursing a career women were ismply folloiwng their natural emotional interest in the ""social claim.""

Critique and Crisis: Enlightenment and the Pathogenesis of Modern Society,"<p style=""text-align: left;""># Reinhart Koselleck, *Critique and Crisis: Enlightenment and the Pathogenesis of Modern Society* (Cambridge: MIT Press, 1988, originally published 1959)</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">## Introduction:</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">* At the start: the point is that this is grounded in a ntoion of European that has become world history: ""Europe's history has broadened; it has becom eworld history and will run its course as that, having allowed the whole world to drift into a state of permanent crisis."" (5)&nbsp; What a massive claim!!!&nbsp; What he means a tad more specifically is ""bourgeois society was the first to cover the globe...""&nbsp; And then he adds something about the ""present crisis"": it ""stems from a mainly Utopian self-conception on the part of the philosophers of history..."" (5)&nbsp; When he's referring to the ""present crisis"" I think he's referring to the Cold War.&nbsp; This he sees in broad strokes as a product of the Enlightenment and the expansion of European ""bourgeois society"" across the globe.&nbsp; Bourgeois society ""saw itself as the new world, laying intellectual claim to the whole world and simultaneously denying the old."" (6) He's presenting it as something thatitis this r's is aggressively trying to see itself as universal: ie he says it ""grew out of the territories of the Euroepan states, and in dissolving this link developed a progressive philosophy in line with the process."" Thus ""its subject was mankind"".&nbsp; Then he jumps to the present wehre he iomagines that this conception has expanded into ""a single global world"" that ""is claimed"" in the name of these universal philosophies of history but which has become dichotomous in that there are these two sides that each see a different vision of progress: ""One half, sworn to progress like the other, lives by that other's imagined reaction.&nbsp; Two halves block each other's way, but it is this very fact that gives them identity They mutually segregate each other in order to feign a non-existent unity.&nbsp; Their testimony is therefore on of terror and fear.&nbsp; The world's Utopian unity reproduces its own fission."" (6)</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">* The goal of the book is to examine the 18th century, a time when the European bourgeoisie ""externally encompassed the whole world and in so doing postulateed one mankind"" and in so doing attack the ""Absolutist order.""&nbsp; And Koselleck sees this as a moment when ""philsophers of history prepared and made available the concepts by which the rise and the role of the bourgeoisie of that time were justified.""&nbsp; (6)&nbsp; And this eighteenth century, he thinks, can be seen as the ""antechamber to our present epoch, one whose tensions have been increasingly exacerbated since the French Revolution..."" (6)&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">* The goal is not to exmaine the ""contents"" of these philosophies of history, but the goal is instead to see its linnk with the ""beginnings of the political crisis"" by trying to ""understand the philosophical sense of history by studying the political situation of the bourgeoisie in the Absolutist state."" (6) The point he's making here is methodological.&nbsp; He's not going to focus primarily on the ideas, but on their use or their relationship to social groups, classes, and so on.&nbsp; He says this a bit later: ""The method used is thus a combination of analyses from the history of ideas and analyses of sociological conditions."" (8) The ideas are not in themselves the focus, but only the way the ideas had political significance.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">* Also key is that what he's doin is to reveal the ""link between the origins of modern philosophy and the start of the crisis which, initially in Europe, has been determining political events ever since 1789..."" (6)&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">* The start is with the Absolutist state because it was the way the Absolutist state fell apart that ""enabled a Utopian modernism to unfold."" (7)&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">* Key passage on 9 v crisis.&nbsp; What is the relationship between crisis and this ""Utopian modernism""?&nbsp; The 18th century thinkers did not themselves see the link between its critique and the looming crisis.&nbsp; But that is key to Koselleck's thesis which is 1) that the critical process created the crisis and 2) that the significance of that crisis remained hidden. (9)&nbsp; ""...that the critical process of enlightenment conjured up the crisis in the same measure in which the political significance of that crisis remained hidden from it.&nbsp; The crisis was as much exacerbated as it was obfuscated in the philosophy of history.&nbsp; Never politically grarsped, it remained concealed in historico-philosophical images of the future which <strong>caused </strong>the day's events to pale -- events that became so much less inhibited in heading for an unexpected decision.""

<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Ch.1 The Absolutist State, Raison d'Etat and the Emergence of the Apolitical Sphere (Barclay, D'Aubigne)</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">* Two ""epochal events"" he says mark the beginnig and the end of ""classical Absolutism."" (15)&nbsp; One is the religious civil wars and then the French Revolution.&nbsp; (15)</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">* England's position is ""exceptional"" because both of these ""chains of events"" coincided.&nbsp; On the continent instead the Abslutist state remained ""the time-bound outcome of the post-Reformation disorders."" (15)The state emerged out of these orders and established its powers: ""Its policies were the theme of the seventeenth century; their paths outlined the history of Absolutism"" (15)&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">* The next era is called Enlightenment and K sees it as a dialectical prodcut of ABsolutism: ""It was from Absolutism that the Enlightenment evolved--initially as its inner consequence, later as its dialectical counterpart and antagonist, destined to lead the Absolutist State to its demise."" (15) And carrying this dialectical explanation further he goes backward: ""Just as the Enlightenment's political point of departure lay within the Absolutist systm, so that of Absolutism lay in the religious wars."" (16) And pushing this further he says there is an ""inner link"" between the completion of Absolutism and its end, and he points out that Enlightenment ""reached its zenith"" in France ""the very country in which the Absolutist system had for the first time, and most decisively, overcome the internal religious conflict."" (16)He says that Louis XIV's abuse of power ""accelerated the process, in the course of which this same citizen would one day storm the Bastille."" (16) That happened when the citizen no longer saw the Absolutist state as a response to religious strife.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">* The first goal K says is to specify how initially the Absolutist state emerged and was justified in its emergence against the background of religious conflict.&nbsp; The ""princely State"" K says ""developed a supra-religious, rationalistic field of action...""&nbsp; The goal of the monarchs was to ""elminiate or neturalise all instituinos with an independent base.&nbsp; Everything would be considered only in terms of its usefullness to the state.&nbsp; Eg mercanistilism.&nbsp; Religion too was considered in this way.&nbsp; (16)&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">* The doctrine under which this was given theoreticla expression was <em>raison d'etat</em>.&nbsp; The idea was that poltiics should function independently of morality.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Montesquieu: ""Dans les monarchies, la politique fait faire les grandes choses avec le moins de vertu qu'elle peut."" (1748).&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">K notes that when Montesquieu made this point it had already ceased to be understandable to the ""Enlighteners."" But the doctrine meerged out of the 16th century when religious conflict had caused the ""entire social order"" to become ""unhinged"" .&nbsp; So the quesiton became how to make peace and the Absolutist state was the answer to that problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">* In laying out the answer to this K comes at it in an interesting way from both sides: ""...the State could not be constitueted as such until it had found its specific answer to religious civil warfare.&nbsp; What was this answer?&nbsp; What did it mean to the monarch?&nbsp; And to the subject?"" This is an interesting approach to look at it from both perspective---</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">*&nbsp; In order to dominate over the warring religious partiesunless they ""challenged the primacy of religion."" (17) This was the only way to subordinate the parties to the State.&nbsp; A key ""vindication of absolute monarchy"" came from John Barclay's *Argenis*, a roman a' clef published in 1621.&nbsp; It was translated into all Euroepan languages and widely known.&nbsp; Barclay was a humanist whose point of view had been shaped by the Gunpowder plot.&nbsp; He challenged the sovereign this way: ""Either give the people back their freedom or assure the domestic tranquility for who se sake they relinquished that freedom."" (18) Barclay preferred the latter and in his work trasnferred all rights to the sovereign.&nbsp; In the view of this text forberarance was seen as more destructive that stringency ""for the consequences of clemcency were bloodier and more devestating than those of severity."" (18) The book also pointed out that the King would have to ""subjugate all or no one would be subjugated."" (18)</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">* <strong>This meant, K says, that there was ""a deep breach...laid in the subjects' position.&nbsp; Previously they had their place in a manifold, if loose, structure of responsibilities: as members of a Church, as dependant vassals, in the framework of their own political institutions or of the feudal order of estates.&nbsp; But the more the sense of this pluralistic world was reversed into the senselessness of civil warfare, the more the subjects faced a similarly cogent alternative as that facing the King himself: 'Know then that almost all men have been reduced to this point: to be on bad terms either with their conscience or with the course of the century.'""&nbsp; The person who survived in other words was the person who did not live according to their conscinece and this was a point developed by Agrippe de'Aubigne' in the voice of the politician de Sancy.&nbsp; ""To survive, the subject must submerge his conscinece."" (19)</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">* Developing this further K interestingly talks about the distribution of guilt and responsibility that this particular way of thinking that justified the Absolutist state created.&nbsp; Conscience he defines as the ""intrinsic relationship bwteen responsibility and guilt"" (19-20) For the subject ""the ruler was freed from all guilt, but he accumulated all responsibility.&nbsp; The subject, on the other hand, was relieved of all political responsibility but threatened, in exhcange, with a twofold guilt: externally when acting counter to his sovereign's interesting--something the sovereign had the sole right to determine--and inwardly be seeking refuge in anonymity."" (20)</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">*&nbsp; But this ""fission within the horizon of religious civil warfare paved the way for the 'innocence of power.'"" (20) The prince alone could be innocent K says, but he had great responsibility because of it.&nbsp; This meant that the prince had increainslgy to act with incredibly and calculated foresignt, and also to make sure that he could act approrpiately according to this calculatino he also had to augment his power, which also created chances that he might fail to use power correctly, or abuse it.&nbsp; (20) ""The scope of the innocence of power remained narrowly circumscribed by the guidelines of a shaprened morality of action."" (20)</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">* These ideas were accepted both by politicians and the ""teachers of secular eiths"" until the 18th century.&nbsp; Spinoza for exmaple ""continued to maintain that only theologians believed that statesmen were bound by the smae rules of piety as were private indivduals."" (21) ""Every power,"" K writes, ""which in those days sought to equip itself with authority and a generally binding nature required this exclusion of the private conscience in which the bonds of religion or of feudal loyalty were anchored."" (21) Thus in 1640 when Parliament wanted to strip Charles I of power they argued that the King's conscience too needed to bow to the interests of the State.</p>
<p>* Hobbes who will be the subject of the next chapter is ""paradigmatic for the modern <br />State theory's genesis."" (21)</p>
<p>## Ch.2 Hobbesian Rationality and the Origins of the Enlightenment</p>
<p>* In this chapter, K describes how Hobbes responds to the situation created by civil war and the rise of the Absolutist state in which their had occured a painful separation of conscience and act -- where in order to survive as K explains in the last chapter, the individual must submerge his conscience. Hobbes' solution is to exclude conscience from political morality, ie. the morality of the state. He does this by developing an anthropology of human nature -- inspired by his own experience of religious war -- in which humans are motivated by passion alone, that is by a struggle for power and the opposite, a longing for peace and a release from this struggle. (24-25)</p>
<p>* Hobbes therefore replaces the discussion of good and evil (ie conscience) with a discussion of war and peace, and considers what must be necessary for a state of peace to be ensured. Conscience he decides is mere opinion -- purely subjective (26-27). The religious wars were destructive because these subjective positions had become the basis for states of mind and action that involved battling others in an attempt to defeat them outwardly and inwardly -- ie making them accept these states of mind (27-28) Hobbes worked against this tendency by ceasing to argue from the inner conscience outward, but rather the reverse. (29) -- And there's a very interesting account of how Hobbes dealth with the old theme of inner/outer separation in the western tradition in f.n. #28.&nbsp; He conceived of the purpose of moral philosophy as that of trying to understand how, given a situation of civil war, wher eit is not clear what is right and wrong, it is possible to transform the comandment to make peace -- rooted in natural law -- into ""a law that can be satisfied by concrete extension."" (30)</p>
<p>* <strong>The resutl of that inquiry was the justification of the Absolutist state as a ""structure in which private mentalities are deprived of their political effect."" (30) </strong>Crucially, then ""[t]he public interest, about which the sovereign alone has the right to decide, no longer lies in the jurisdiction of conscience. Conscience, which becomes alienated from the State, turns into private morality. 'Auctorits, non verits facit legem' -- laws made by authority, not by truth."" (31)</p>
<p>* So Hobbes morality of reason is a ""morality that accepts the ruler's absolute political sovereignty as a moral necessity."" (31) IN the war of all against all, the individual is in a state of constant fear; that individual fears not anything in particular but everything, death, but that indiviudal will ""flee to the State, and protection is therefore the State's highest moral obligation."" (31)</p>
<p>* But Hobbes did not think that morality alone would produce the sitaution that would end civil war. ""Peace is guaranateed only if political morality, the quality that makes men cede their rights to the sovereign representing them, is transformed in the act of state-founding into a duty to obey."" (32) So therefore what makes the State what it is is the ""interrelation of proection and obedience"" as well as the absolute power of the prince. (32-34)</p>
<p>* Key point in Koselleck's borader argument: So what you have in Locke is a juncture that is stil ""situational"" (34) -- ie. defined by a philosophy guided by the experience of Civil War -- that creates a ""juncture"" of Absolutism and rationalist philosophy. (34) : ""Reason, rising from the turmoil of religious warfare, at first remains under the spell of that warfare and founds the State""&nbsp; (34) This is a key point in K's argument because it explains why Hobbes failed to see the effect of his exclusion of conscience from public interest. Hobbes starting point was his own experience of civil war. Thus he has been accused of being very subjective, i,e, the crique that he ""inferred what out to be from what is, that he had his well-ordered State arise from a state of nature in which men act like wolves towards each other."" (40) Dilthey evidently spoke of Hobbes 'Impetusous subjectivity."" (quoted on 40)</p>
<p>* <strong>What Hobbes could not see, however, is that once the State ""Uspressed and neturalised religous conflict"" then ""progressive reason could unfodl in the newly vacated space.""</strong> For Hobbes, history was just a vacillation between war and peace; his interest was thus only that the State succeed in demanding obedience and supressing civil war. But his ""formalistion of the soverign concept of law"" still rested on ""the distinction between conscience and action,"" ie. Hobbes, who cared not for the substance of laws, but only the fact that citizens must submit to them, could only think this way if the act of obediance was separated from the content of the act itself, ie if act and conscience were perceived as seprate. (36) Thus this distinction, which Hobbes had tried to abolish, remained. <strong>It became a a central dynamic of the Absolutist state. ""Hobbes's man is factured, split into private and public halves; his actions are totally subject to the law of the land while his mind remains free, 'in secret free.' From here on the individual is free to migrate into his state of mind without being responsible for it</strong>. The sovereign command relieved the subject of all responsiblity: 'The Law is the publique Conscience -- priate Consciences...are but private opinions.'"" (37) But then if the individual's conscience ventured into a ""jurisdiction which the State reserved to itself"" then the ""individual had to mystify himself."" This meant that under the Absolutist state: ""The dialectic of mystery and enlightenment, of mystification and unmasking, was already one of the roots of the Absolutist State.""</p>
<p>*<strong> What Enlightenment would do then is to expand the ""mind's inner space"". </strong>Under the Absolutist state, humans were human only ion private; in public they were citizen's. So ""That a man was human was&nbsp; his secret; as such he was bound to escape the sovereign's notice."" But this is where, K says, the Enlightnement would aim its attack.&nbsp; The State had ""conceded to the individual an inner space that did not much impair the sovereign decision..."" (38) The State in fact remain morally neutral and if it did not it would lose its legtiimacy. But then what ultimately occured is that the ""State created a new order"" and then ""in genuinely historical fashion -- fell prety to that order."" --&gt; ""The authority of coscience remained an unconquered remnant of the state of nature, protruding into the formally perfected State."" (39)</p>
<p>* But when it returned, morality had been secularized -- in party by the States' ""neutralisation of conscience"" (39) --&gt; ""A crumbling of the faith in revelation that had necessitated the creation of the State doomed the same State as the old themes recurred in secualrised from. A morality striving to become political would be the great theme of the eighteenth century."" (39)</p>
<p>* Enlightenment then was partly about a movement that no longer understood ""the distinction between man and subject""--""Publicly man was to realise himself as a human being, with the resulting decay of the Absolutist State."" (39)</p>

<p> </p>"
"Wilhelm von Humboldt: The Theory and Practice of Self-Formation (Bildung), 1791-1810","<p>General Notes 10/12</p>
<p>#David Sorkin, ""Wilhelm von Humboldt: The Theory and Practice of Self-Formation (Bildung), 1791-1810"" <em>Journal of the History of Ideas</em>, v.44, no.1 (Jan.-Mar., 1983): 55-73.</p>
<p>* Sorkin traces the development of Humboldt's ideas about <em>Bildung</em>. The interesting part of this article is to see how Humboldt tried to navigate the various challenges by different political programs and pressure to the theory of self-formation that he was developing in order to develop a pedagogical notion and concrete reform that would sustain the growth of indivdual autonomy and the emergence of a minimal state whose existence served to support the grwoth of such indivduals and was also sustained or produced out of the assocaition of such individuals. It's a complex account.</p>
<p>* A key consideration here is whether or&nbsp; not Humboldt's original description of Bildung in his political theory of 1791-2 was consistent with the reform he effect as Education minister in 1809-1810. ""Could the reform of education by the state be compatible with a thoery that advocated private eduation free from state interference?"" (55) Many liberal historians (Haym to Meineck) have mainted that he was consistent. This issue is important because hsi theory of <em>Bildung</em> ""has been consdiered the doctrine that legitimized the alliance of the intelligentsia and the state through the university."" Thus the question is if he was inconsistent ""can his metamorphosis be seen as representative of the capitultion of th eliberal intelligentsia to the Prussian state? Was that capitulation the inevitable resutl fo the concept of <em>Bildung</em>?"" (56)</p>
<p>* Humboldt's biography ""turns on a confilct between training and charachter..."" He was destinged cor a career in state service but was ""irresistibly drawn toward self-cultivation."" (56) Part of this tension camme from Humboldt but it also derived from broader cultural and osciuological chagnes. ""The larger historical roots of this genearl emphasis on the individual and self-cultivation are to be found int h deterioriation fo the estate structure adn the search for new forms of sociability (witness the proliferation of secret societies, lodgs, and salons) in the increasing power of the absolutist state and the grwoth of a bureacuratic intelligentsia, as well as in the cultural movements of th eperio, the sentimantal turn of the late Enlightenment followed by neo-humanism and romanticism."" (56)</p>
<p>* Humbodlt's political theory, <em>the Limits of StateAction,&nbsp; </em>was written after Humboldt retired from state service.&nbsp; It has been seen as a defense tof hsi retirement and a response to the French Revolution. ""Humbodt emraces the ideals of political freedom but rejects revolution in favor of a stable model of organic development, anticipatin Burke in fearing the unforeseen consequences of action that depart from that model."" (58) But the central idea Sorkin says predates these influences. He noes an essay ""On Religion"" written between August 1788 and July 1789 that calls for political thinking that stars from ideas inherent to Rousseau's pedagogy. Sorkin quotes:</p>
<p>&gt; When will man finally cease to regard the outward consequences of action with greater esteem than the inward spiritual frame of mind from which they flow; when will someon eappear who will be fore legislation what Rousseau was for education, who will withdraw the point of vangage fromthe otuward physical results to the inward cultivation (bildung) of men? (quoted on 58).</p>
<p>* So the idea struturin ghis political theory is a dichotomy between ""the inward development of man and the outward action of the citizen..."" (58) <em>Limits</em> then describes a kind of political sovereignty vv man's inward process of devleopment and this ""specific image of man"" Humboldt dervied from a close reading of Leibniz. Sorkin explains:</p>
<p>&gt; Humboldt evisages man as a dynamic organism uniquely characterized by his energy: ' Energy (Kraft) appears to me to be the first and unique virtue of mankind.' An individula's development depends upon finding appropriate outlets for his energy so that eh can engage in activity by means of which he realizes his poentialities and iucnreases his abilities. One essential condition for such activity is freedom: one must be assured of the freedom to act for onself, that is, to be self-reliant. A second essential condition is 'social intercourse': one develops through the voluntary interchange of one's indivdiualitywith that of others. Self-formation, in other words, requires social bonds. (58-59)</p>
<p>* This two-part formulation introduces the problem that Sorkin wants to trace. The <em>Limits</em> focused on the notion of inner development and less on social intercourse. Sorkin suggest that Humboldt had acquired from Leibniz the central problem of <em>mutatis mutandis</em>: ""Leibniz had predicated his concept of individual monads of energy on the metaphysical presupposition of the 'pre-establish harmony' of the universal. Only with such a concept of metaphysical harmony could Liebniz account for the interaction of the individual monads...as well as maintain a notion of a unified world."" (59) But for Humboldt harmony could not be stablished metaphysically: ""it is a political and social harmony which must be achieved in the modern state."" (60)</p>
<p>* Humboldt thought such a thing existed in ancient Greece. (60) But he did not think that the the modern state could emulate the <em>polis</em> because it was to eudaemonistic, attending to well-being and happiness. It's goal was bascially to supress huamn energies ""in favor of obtaining a prodcutive and obedient citizen."" (60) Therefore the modern state must be given a negative function. (60)</p>
<p>* Limiting the state helped provide for the self's inner formation, but it did not establish the conditions for the second condition of self-cultivation: socail intercoruse and social bonds. He noted teh failure of existing state institutions to allow the grwoth of such indivudals. but the hope for a set of institutions that would adequately provide for such social intercourse remained utopian in his saccount. (60-61).</p>
<p>* He addressed the second issue more in his role as reform in 1809-1810. In between, Sorkin says he had u""discovered"" the nation as a ""mediating concept between the individaul and humanity"" and as a ""concrete entity in his own life."" (61) He also developed a sense of himself as ""German"" and an emotional feeling toward Prussia. (61), Although this ""incipient nationalism"" did not lead him away from his political ideas. In reforming state education he wanted to return ""control of education to the nation"". ""If the nation were made responsible for educatino, and if freedom prevailed within the educational institutions themselves, he thought, then the nation would develop an associational life in and around the educational system that would foster the interchange requisite to <em>Bildung</em>."" (61)&nbsp; But at the same time he thought that cuodl honly happen when his own SEction for Education ceased to exist. (61)&nbsp; -- since the state as he saw it was a legal and not an educational institution.</p>
<p>* In his reform he laid out a 3-point program. 1) The nation would take financial responsibility for the schools. The idea was that hte citizenry would become involved in the school sif the responsiblity for the schools fell on the nation. (62) 2) He proposed that barriers to education be removed because these were inimiatal to natioanl unity. Ie removal of the policiesw that"" segregated the estates and trained students for different functions."" (62) He proposed the abolition of military schools taht catered to the nobility. All woudl attend school together. He wrote: ""The organization of the schools pays heed to no caste, to no single corporation, and not even to the scholar."" (62) The idea here was consistent with the Rousseauist principle that informed the limits: taht the person is more than a citizen.Anda t the same time Sorkin thinks it also created ""the precondition for new social bonds."" (63), allowing ""<em>Bildung</em>..to function as the basis for the new social interaction essential to <em>Bildung</em>."" (63) 3) The curriculum of the school would be as follows: in elementary school students would learn basic skills. In high school (Schule) they would learn how to learn. A student woudl be considered ""mature"" when he ""had learned enough from others to be able to learn by himself."" (quoted on 63). The university's goal was to bring students together into a ""community devoted to learning (<em>Wissenschaft)</em>"" and to provide them the freedom to intearact in such an environment. This would involve cooperation and interaction but also a ""heightening of one's energies (<em>Kraefte)</em>"" (63).</p>
<p>* Sorkin's interpretation then is that Humboldt's reforms were in fact consistent with his earlier theory in the <em>Limits</em>. ""By returning the schools to the nation, creating an egalitarian system suited to the person rather than to the citizen, and by providing a general education in an atmosphere of freedom, Humboldt hoped to foster the social bonds necessary to <em>Bildung</em>. His nascent natioanlism provided the basis for his internal consistency; it did not compel him to abjure his earlier principles, as critics of his inconsistency have maintained."" (63)</p>
<p>* Yet Sorkin wants to suggest that his consistency here involved a meshing of neo-humanist ideas with <em>Aufklaerung</em> in a way that was ""not unalloyed."" (63) Humboldt had to reconcile neo-humanist and <em>Aufklaerung</em> ideas because ""the Prussian state had appropriated <em>Bildung</em> as its official pedagogy and demoted it from an autonomus ideal to an instrumental role.&nbsp; In its tranlation from high into applied culture, then,&nbsp; <em>Bildung</em> had been essentially betrayed. That very task of application was to be one of Humboldt's contributions to the history of <em>Bildung</em>... "" (64) Humboldt achieved this by ""assigning <em>Aufklaerung</em> functions to neo-humanist ideas..."" (64), meaning that he saw the goals of service to the state (ie the applied notion of <em>Aufklaerung</em> that the Prussians had adopted) as being ""realized indirectly as the intended yet incidental consequences of <em>Bildung</em>."" Ie Humboldt argued that ""persons educated to be free individuals will ultimately be better citizens than&nbsp; men educated to be citizens, just as science left to its own devices will be more fruitful than science supervised by the state."" (64)</p>
<p>* This theoretical reconcialiation of neo-humanism and <em>Aufklaerung </em>notions of service to teh state was also played out on a personal level as Humboldt found in his reform position an opportunity to reconcile his personal tensions between self-cultivation and service.(65-66)</p>
<p>*BUT Sorkin thinks there was a cost to this reconciliation. Anmd this is a key part of his ultimate argument. In order to make the point he contrasts Humboldt's notion of <em>bildung</em> with those extant in the period. At the end of the 18th century there were two notions: ""one conception emphasized theitnernal spiritualized prodcess by which man attained self-realization, and the other focused on the social activity integral to and coincident with <em>Bildung's</em> consummation in man's self-harmony."" (66-67) Both of these concepts were present in Humboldt's <em>Limits</em>, and Sorkin explains precisely how 67-69. But in the 1809-10 memoranda laying otu his reform Sorkin say that this ""civiic conception"" does not appear. ""In the one passage where [it does appear]...it has been totally assimilated to the inward process of <em>Bildung</em>."" (69) What is lost then is the idea that the individual's process of inner development is ""consumated"" and copmleted through social itneraction: ""The concept of persons achieving innher harmony withinthe web of socail interrelations has disappeared and so, too, has the activity issuing from that concept, the activity whereby man judges political relations by the standards of his own harmoney."" (69)</p>
<p>* The significance of this interpretation is as follows: Liberals from Haym to Meinecke have held that Humbotltd's reforms were ""entirely of a piece with the reforms of Prussia proposed by Stein (1806-1808)"" and which laid out a program for a renewal and revival of local government, including a program to promote local assemblies that woudl include commoners. Stein's insight was that ""a reform of the educational system woudl be necessary to prepare the bourgeoisie for particpation in political life."" (69) <strong>But the fact that Humboldt let go of the civic coneption of <em>Bildung</em> in his reform memoranda means that ""although Humboldt counted himself among the reformers, attempting to return the edducational system to the nation and to foster freedom and new social bonds, the political imperative that could have animated the schools was lost. The schools would not advance notions of civic activity but would remain an instrument of autocratic rule producing obedient if not apolitical subjects."" (69) </strong></p>
<p>* Why did Humboldt drop the cicic conception? Sorkin thinks it had to do with his opposition to a middle-class movement for national education (<em>Nationalerziehung</em>) that had as one of its leading supporters Fichte. The movement that fichte aderessed in his 1808 ""Addresses to the German Nation"" was an attempt to ""reconcile the free self-reliant intellectual and ultimately moral activity of the individual--the avowed basis of regeneration--with a system of education that subordinates the individual to the nation with the aim of producing loyal and patriotic citizens."" (70) The students were to be taught using the tecniques of Pestalozzi that did emphasize self-activity, but the schools were to be ""strictly regimented (chidlren are to be removed from their parents' homes and raised in economically autarchic communities where teachers serve as confessors as well as instructors)."" (70) Sorkin's argument is that Humboldt eliminated the civic conception of <em>Bildung</em> because due to certain overlaps it had with this movement for natioanl education. ""It empahsized the product rather than the process of <em>Bildung</em> although it did not determine the final content of the prodcut but onkly its form, harmony. In addition, the civic conception had direct political implications, unlike the inward conception which Humbodt put indirectly to <em>Aufklaerung</em> purposes."" Sorkin thinks that because of these similarities Humboldt feared that ""the atuonomy of <em>Bildung</em> would be endangered were he to maintain the civic conception."" (72) Ie that there could be a confusion of his ideas with the Fichtean ideas, and Sorkin thinks this fear was reasonable. (72)</p>
<p>* Yet Sorkin's feeling is that the absence of the civic conception weakened the reform that Humboldt laid out and ""adumbrated"" its ""political fate."" (73) 1) Despite the egalitarian principles, the reform utlimately ""became the social and ideological basis of a new elite lacking the itnernal imperative of political acitvity and wedded to the state in exchange for teh state's identification with culture."" (73) -- he's citing Ringer's <em>Decline fo the German Mandarins</em> here. 2) The balance between serice and autonomy that Humboldt had tried to create was Sorkin tihnks ""shattered"" by a process of ""insitutionalization"" that was complete by 1820. Thus ""<em>Bildung</em>...became the first servant of the Prussian state. Humboldt's reorientation of political thought and his reconcilation of neo-humanism with <em>Aufklaerung</em> was subverted at he state-subordinated edcuational program of the eighteenth century-continued in new guise into the nineteenth century.""(73)</p>
<p>* So Sorkin's last line is: ""While Humobldt had not departed from his liberalism, his edcuational reform did in the end become a bais for the capitualation of the intelligentsia to the state."" (73)</p>

The Idea of the Self: Thought and Experience in Europe Since the 17th Century,"<p>General Notes 2/2013:</p>
<p>## Chapter 1: ""Dimensions and contexts of selfhood""</p>
<p>* His book starts out of a ""sense of concern (mainly skeptical) about these [postmodern] notions [of the end of the individual]..."" (4) He found these arguments in Claude Levi-Strauus, Maurice Merlau-Ponty, Roland Barthes, and Michel Foucault. And anticipating them Marchel Duchamp.</p>
<p>* His feelings is that the demand of unity that many critics of unitary selfhood identify is more charachteristics of those critics than it is of those who have sough to conceive of the individual as a center of action. That ""paradox"" he says lies at the center of our ""modern culture"" and its highly contested disputes about the self.</p>
<p>&gt; ""...attempts to loate or promote such untrammeled modes of self-existence arise ore often and more characteristically out of the negation of the common-sense understanding of individuals as centers of action and consciousness than out of their affirmation; the sense that human beings must be all in order to escape being nothing has belonged more to those who have sough some kind of fulfillment by way of it."" (5)</p>
<p>* He says there are three dimensions along which ""the basis of selfhood"" has been sought in ""Western culture."" (5): 1) the bodily or material, 2) the relational, and 3) the reflective. He describes these on 5-7.</p>
<p>*Underlying these three dimensions there is a broader binary dimension: that of multi-dimensional and one-dimensional accounts of the self. (7) In his account, it is the one-dimensional account of the self that is suspect. For the paradox he mentioned before -- that ""paradoxcial conjunction between radically narrowing the self's independence or autonomy and inflating it beyond limits"" (7) -- is primarily a product he thinks of conceiving of the self one-dimensionally. He has a good quote explaining this on 9:</p>
<p>&gt; What is perhaps surprising about one-dimensinoal modesl of the self is the capaicty they often display to transfigure life, by envisioning a rapid passage between -- or sometimes coexistence of -- images that confine human agency within rigid limits and one that give the widest possible scope to it. It is just such metamorphoses that generate the pattern remarked above, in which denials of the self's independence lodge together with its radical exaltation. The same thinkers who image a self so deeply infused with the conditions of its material nature or surroundings that it possesses little or no capacity for going beyond them turn out to be those who imagine one capable of constituting itself wholly by some kind of profoundly liberating self-directedness. The Cartesian ego suddenly enters into the truth of its own self-referential subjectivity just at the point when its subjection to worldly confusion and uncertainty seems most complete. (9)</p>
<p>* By contrast, a multi-dimensional understanding of the self does not absolutely negate the unity of the self. ""To acknoweldge these strains and stresses [in a multidimensional account] is not] is not the same as to deny that indivdiuals can attain to a measure of stable unity and integrity..."" (7)</p>
<p>* Seigel gives special place to the dimension of reflexivity in accounts of these different possibilities for the self. Reflectivity he says is the domain ""most likely to be exalted or diminished"" where the self' autonomy is in question. ""Only reflectivity can claim to found the radical freedom of the self, and only its eradication can issue in a self that is totally absorbed into some set of external determinations."" (10)</p>
<p>* What he thinks very often determines whether a thinker uses a one- or multi-dimensional view of the self is often ""that person's way of settting reflectivity in relation to other attributes."" (10)</p>
<p>* He suggests as well that the tendency to discount the self's capacity for reflectivity is often accompanied by a critical arrogance: ""those who theorize the radical circumscription of the self must speak from outside the position in which the theory seems to put them."" (11)</p>
<p>* So what is reflectivity? He says it is the ""ingredient of intelletual self-awareness in selfhood, the contribution made to it by the mind."" (12) It is a kind of reflection that tends to create thoughts and questions about what ideas an dimpressions of the outside world ""indicate about our own being."" (12) These questions then create a ""'second-order' relationship to the contents of experience"" that creates a kind of distance from immediate experience. He also refers to this as a kind of ""doubling"" that can continue in order to create greater distance. (12)</p>
<p>* He wants to differentiate reflectivity from reflexivity, which he says are often linked indicating the whole problem: for reflexivity he thinks refers to more unconsciousor passive kinds of reflectivity that occur in ""involuntary reflexes or in a mirror..."" (12-13)</p>
<p>* If one looks at the etymology of the words self or subject, and also language he says in a nice bit of exposition, the two concepts of the self as passive or active are often in close proximity. (13-14)</p>
<p>* Also if one looks at the classic dispute between Hegel and Kant vv experience, there is the same tension. (15) Hume looked inside himself and found no self, and only ""feelings,impressions, or iddeas that occupied him at particular moments, so that the self was a kind of empty theater, the passive container wher various scences succeed each other."" (15) Kant rejected that account, arguing that ""wherever there is experence of any sort, beginning with sesnse impressions, an active subject must be at work."" (15)</p>
<p>* In Kant's account, there is a ""passage"" from passive to active subjecthood that arises when one connects one experience with another... The terms ""slef and subject oth bear th esigns of inhabiting this passage."" (15)</p>
<p>* Identity. Same mixture of activity and passivity is there. Same also with the notion of person. (15-16). So all toether these terms all bear passive and active forms. And together they constitute a ""vocabulary of selfhood, a linguistic register from whci we single out one or another depending on the contexxt in which we employ the idea, or the particular purpose we ask it to serve."" (16)</p>
<p>* Now he comes out with his preference: He prefesrs the multi-dimensional accounts of the self. This he thinks is the basis for our reflective control. Precisely because we are both corporeal and relational he says, we must ""take a certain distance from each..."" (17) Through reflectivity we can accomplish this and this allows us ""in some degree"" to deal with the ""tensions or conflicts between what biology demands and what social and cultural existence imposes or allows."" (17) This is the precondition for managig both ""material"" and ""external"" (ie cultural) pressures. ""The capacity to objectify and in part determine our own relation to the competing condition of our own existence is a prerequisite for surviving the complexity of being human, even in what are sometimes called 'simple' societies."" (18)</p>

<p>### Ch.9 Autonomy, limitation, and the purposiveness of Nature: Kant<br /><br />* A here places Heidegger, Nietzsche and Schopenhauer at the basis of<br />challenges to ""notions of selfhood and subjectivity"". He sees them as<br />the key inspirations for the powerful challenges that developedˇˇ later<br />in French thought. The interpretation is problematic I think. Totally<br />based in a Lind of crude Sonderweg line, as one he says Nietzsche and<br />Heidegger were ""unmistakably"" German and ""unimaginable"" in ""any other<br />cultural tradition."" Strangely also he then roots both thinkers in<br />Kant who he says was the founder of modern idealism, as if there were<br />no other side to Kant. (295)<br /><br />* Here on 295-295 S gives his account of Kant's separation of science<br />and religion, but he suggests that Kant's ultimate motive was to make<br />room for faith, which seems simplistic and ideological as an<br />interpretation. Ie he says that what Kant had done was to ""leave a<br />sense that human actions can be free [in the noumenal realm] protected<br />&nbsp;(296)<br /><br />* The root of the move By Kant S finds in Leibniz's&nbsp; theory of monads.<br />The idea of individuals as fully unified and unique, expressing in<br />themselves a pre-existing harmony, and also expressing a unity in<br />humanity established by god. S describes this as a ""homology"" between<br />the individual and the world - or isomorphism of the self (298) --that<br />Kant preserves while trying to ground it in Universal rationality.<br />(297) , thus making it less ""baroque"". 296-298<br /><br />&gt; ""Kant conceived it (and as their successors would too, in their<br />different ways) was reflective: the inner relations of its parts were<br />patterned on the self-relatedness of consciousness.""<br /><br />* Vv his own argument, S notes that this was a "" reflective"" model of<br />the self because the ""inner relations"" of the self's parts were<br />""patterned on the self-relatedness of consciousness."" (298) but the<br />course of self fulfillment could in the end not derail the<br />teleological course of self development driven by the self's folding.<br />(298)<br /><br />&gt; ""However great the power attributed to nature, society, or culture in<br />shaping the self, these otherwise non-reflective dimen- sions could be<br />drawn back into the reflective one by virtue of the whole world’s<br />inner conformity to the principle of self-relatedness.""<br /><br />&gt; ""Kant’s organized the idea of selfhood around the notion of autonomy;<br />the self achieved freedom by following the self-made laws of its own<br />rational nature. Such selfhood was universal in that all rational<br />individuals were, in principle, equally capable of achieving it, and<br />all did so by following the same rules. Leibniz’s model was different:<br />it projected a self that was free in the sense of not being determined<br />by external objects or relations, but it did not legislate rules for<br />itself and others; it simply followed the innate principle of its own<br />nature. Such selves achieved realization as individuals, not as<br />bearers of a universal reason, and they did not necessarily transcend<br />material existence, since material monads followed their inner notion just as spiritual ones did.""<br /><br />* Yep okay so then S boils this all down to two models of the self, one<br />grounds the self in a certain reflective autonomy, and the other in an<br />expressionist form of the self. The former is Kant's and roots the<br />self in an autonomy won through the unfolding of a rational nature,<br />and he other was Leibnizian with a focus on the way the self was<br />""free"" by being free from external constraints in nature, but not as<br />possessors of universal reason. Yet both required a kind of<br />isomorphism of the self. (298-299)<br /><br />&gt; ""The two forms of selfhood were thus internally related to each other,<br />and it should be no surprise that the Leibnizian one was given new<br />life in Kant’s time by his wayward student Johann Gottfried Herder,<br />and by others who drew on Herder’s organic and harmonious universe.<br />Herder’s expressivism would be combined with versions of Kantian<br />autonomy by post-Kantians, notably by Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel.""<br /><br />* Herder breathed new life into the Leibniziam form. (299) a bit<br />farther down the page here he says that Goethe and Humboldt also<br />represented exponents of the expressionist form (299). And also both<br />could express a sense of radical individualism or limits. Limits in<br />the Jantian autonomous sense because the self was part material and<br />natural, and the expressionist because one had to live in a world of<br />others.<br /><br />&gt; ""Both were capable of supporting radical notions of self-realization,<br />since they posited a world in harmony with the self; but each was also<br />capable of assigning limits to the self in the present, Kantian<br />autonomy by its recognition that humans were material creatures as<br />well as rational ones, and expressivism through the acknowledgment<br />that every self had to inhabit a world occupied at the same time by<br />others. Kant himself exemplified the moderation with which the idea of<br />autonomy could be developed, as Herder, Goethe, and Humboldt did for<br />the expressivist one.""<br /><br />* This sense of limits ""justifies"" S says a view -- and he quotes some<br />scholars -- that Kant and Idealism were not about a total<br />transcendence of every limit. But S does not think this is the whole<br />story. S thinks that his desire to preserve a realm for ""pure<br />reflective freedom"" invited a transcendence of the limits he himself<br />accepted and that is exactly what many of his followers did.... Ie<br />Feurbach, Marx, and Heidegger all in different ways. (300-301)<br /><br />&gt; ""Prussia was exemplary but not unique in making aristocrats its<br />partners in state-building, relying on them not only for army officers<br />but also for bureaucrats and officials, while leaving their local<br />power intact as a recompense""<br /><br />&gt; ""Thus German political life was marked by what Leonard Krieger called<br />a “continuum between noble subject and noble sovereign,” strengthened<br />by the prince’s success in “defin- ing his power as the synthesis of<br />their liberties.” Where commoners became state servants they found<br />their opportunities for personal and professional advance inside the<br />same structures. O""<br /><br />* S tries to track the basis the german idealist spirit. It has to do<br />with the 1) te nature of political absolutism in Germany where unlike<br />the centralizing tendency in France that gave prominent place to civil<br />servants as , the Prussian state made aristocrats its partner in<br />state-building, giving them rights as bureaucrats.&nbsp; At the same time,<br />comsiderable autonomy persisted in small hometowns where there was a<br />great focus on religiouus life. (300-301). 2) the influence of<br />Protestntism, with the emphasis on ""inner freedom"", the tendency to<br />feel that this freedom could not be compromised with the external<br />world. (301-302)<br /><br />&gt; ""The opposition of manners and values the two terms evoked referred<br />also to what underlay them, the contrast in social and polit- ical<br />structures between a society animated by a centralizing monarchy whose<br />court and official culture set the tone for both the aristocratic and<br />bourgeois groups who were drawn into its train, and one where the<br />absence of central integration allowed various forms of local, often<br />modest and simple, but self-consciously inward-looking life to develop<br />relatively undisturbed.8""<br /><br />* The lack of cultural integration in Germany meant that culture played<br />a particularly powerful role in developing the basis for a atonal life<br />in Germany. There was before 1720 in Germany no common literary<br />language and by mid century there was a profound and self-conscious<br />desire to build one, a desire for an expanded world, that led to<br />Auglaerung...there was a new thirst for travel accounts, newspapers,<br />reading clubs, etc. (302) this then also led to Bildung, which S *s<br />well was not just education but a process of self formation. (302-303)<br />Here S traces these influences into the terms Bildung and Kultur.<br />Kultur was contrasted to external civilization in reference to French<br />centralized bureaucracy. It indicated a aftermathn emphasis on inner<br />Spiritual life and honesty. It fit a society S notes in which a lack<br />of cultural integration ""allowed various forms of local, often modest<br />and simple, but self-consciously inward-looking life to develop<br />relatively undisturbed."" (302)<br /><br />&gt; ""All these cultural forms contributed to Bildung, which referred not<br />just to formal education, but more generally to the process of<br />personal forma- tion that wider experience of the world helped to<br />bring about""<br /><br />* States, in connection with the continuum between the state and the<br />aristocracy mentioned before, were also seen as a source of Vildung,<br />which meant also that to ""One reason for seeking Bildung or for<br />claiming to embody it was precisely that it constituted a claim to<br />service in the ranks of officialdom that were expected to further<br />reform."" 303) this created in some cases a deeper continuity between<br />""inwardness and power"" that was evident in many lives, and<br />specifically in Kant's. His parents were pietistic and modest, his<br />father was a saddler. But he was then given a chance to devel his<br />intellectual talents by pastor . What S is trying to get at is a link<br />between an earlier private world of state sponsored Protestantism and<br />its new formulation in a Bildung and Kultur. (303-304)<br /><br />&gt; ""Freedom and progress for him were always deeply tied up with the<br />world of inner life rooted in Protestantism and unfolded as Kultur and<br />Bildung.""<br /><br />* S suggests here that Kant developed this link in a somewhat<br />apolitical direction, making freedom and progress a matter of morality<br />and inner development. s says he did this concretely by ""he<br />transferred Rousseau’s notion of autonomy as obedience to self-made<br />laws from the realm of politics where the Genevan had located it to<br />the domain of moral action in general, making suitability for<br />universal legislation the principle not of the political general will,<br />but of the good will in the wider realm of ethical behavior. Later he<br />would welcome the French Revolution as the sign of humanity’s capacity<br />to emancipate itself and live in freedom, but in a peculiar way:<br />according to him the historical manifestation of this capacity was not<br />in the actions of the Revolutionaries, but in the sympathy their<br />doings aroused in the hearts and minds of foreign spectators, whose<br />disinterested enthusiasm could only be explained as the effect of a<br />“moral disposition within the human race,” an inner aptitude for<br />freedom."" (304)<br /><br />&gt; ""he transferred Rousseau’s notion of autonomy as obedience to<br />self-made laws from the realm of politics where the Genevan had<br />located it to the domain of moral action in general, making<br />suitability for universal legislation the principle not of the<br />political general will, but of the good will in the wider realm of<br />ethical behavior.""<br /><br />&gt; ""Kant set up a series of problems for himself and his successors, all<br />deriving from the question of how the different modes of the self were<br />related to each other.""<br /><br />&gt; ""What appears as the rela- tionship between the egoistic and<br />pluralistic modes of self-existence in the Anthropology becomes, in<br />his more formal writings, the question of how the rational and<br />empirical selves can be unified as a single moral actor.""<br /><br />&gt; ""His assumption seems to have been that being a rational creature<br />requires a kind of unity, a need met in one way by transcendental<br />subjectivity when it organizes perceptions into the unity of<br />consciousness, and in another by the categorical imperative, which<br />organizes desires and impulses into a singleness of moral purpose that<br />frees the person from material determination.""<br /><br />* Important point a bout Kant's notion of freedom, that it is<br />""spontaneous"" as Henry Allison puts it. It is based in the capacity of<br />the free will to ""set its own ends."" (313) This quality of spontaneity<br />S distinguishes from autonomy. Autonomy here is the categorical<br />imperative that gives the self the qualities that make it possible<br />that it can act freely, ie independently of external control. But<br />spontaneity is that capacity to define ones of ends. It is more<br />""emphatic."" The two are often confused, but the point is that to trace<br />the basis of our autonomy does not release us from nature for it does<br />not account for what allows us to set our own ends.&nbsp; (313) Note: Cf<br />with Morris-Reich's idea of the difference between autonomy and<br />individuality in Simmel.<br /><br />* Here S start a section in which he suggests that the radicalism of<br />Kant's spontaneous conception of freedom drove him toward the end of<br />his life to inject a sense of rational purpose into nature. This was<br />the case because a spontaneous self could not exist where external<br />determinations from nature intervened. The ideal of such freedom was<br />too radical. But if one imagined that nature too was structured ""in<br />accord"" with human moral purposiveness than such an ideal was<br />possible, ie Kant spoke in the Critique of Judgement of if humans<br />getting ""help from nature"" to ""fulfill a condition beyond our<br />abilities."" (314)<br /><br />* This need to establish a sense of rational purpose in the world S<br />locates earlier in the first critique when he tries to account for the<br />way in which the three levels of the self work together and cannot<br />without attributing a basic harmony or unity in our faculties to a<br />creative agency that brought them into being. The move Dieter<br />Helinrich has described as a reworking of Liebniz's notion of a<br />pre-established teleological harmony in he self and the world, only in<br />Kant it is based on a division within the self. (314-315)<br /><br />* Here S is saying that Kant ultimately was tempted to attribute to<br />this rational purpose in nature a kind of constitutive quality,<br />despite the fact that officially he saw it as a merely ""regulative<br />principle"", ie something that served merely to clarify the idea that<br />it made sense for humans to seek knowledge about the world because it<br />was in fact an organized and sense ridden thing.&nbsp; (315-316)<br /><br />* Key to S argument here is that the fact that Kant both insisted on<br />this division between material and spiritual, nature and unity of<br />purpose, ie freedom, suggests how much he wanted to preserve for the<br />self a radical kind of freedom. Only by denying that the material and<br />rational-intelligible forms of the self intermingled could he preserve<br />the possibility of such a radical rationality, even if he was clear<br />that we could not fully know that ends of that purpose. He was thus<br />incredibly restrained. And S says it was his ""restraint that bore the<br />seeds of their [his sucessors] determination to break through it""<br />(317) by providing a unified conception of the self. (316-317)<br /><br /><br />* ""S is very determined here to read Kant in terms ofma basic desire to<br />overcome the restraints that he also hemmed to practice. That is, in<br />terms of a desire to see in Kant a tendency to posit an isomorphism<br />between the idea of harmonious self development in nature and in the<br />domain mod moral reason and human history. Interesting though to<br />compare this interpretive thrust with Köhnke's story about in his book<br />about the neo Kantians, ie that this was first in idealism a Mi's<br />reading of Kant, and then also in Kuno Fischer's neo idealism again a<br />misreading. That is for Köhnke's Kant is all about restraint... (327)""<br /><br /><br />### Ch.10 Homology and Bildung: Herder, Humboldt, and Goethe<br /><br />* ""S starts this chapter with reference to his interpretation in which<br />Kant introduced a sense of purposiveness into nature, thus playing on<br />Leibniz's move to introduce a teleological structure into the world.<br />This was a way to escape scientific determinism. ""If monads followed<br />their own internal principles, then their actions and destinies were<br />not the products of exter- nal, mechanical causes."" (332) Yet S notes<br />there could also be a passive side to the monad, ie S wants to say<br />that positing an isomorphism of self and world could also lead one to<br />develop a sense of the limits of the self's capacity for reflective<br />self determination. Both potentials were developed by Kant's<br />successors, but in this chapter S will look at Herder and Goethe who<br />both hewed closer to Leibniz in ""seeking not Kantian freedom, but a<br />kind of spontaneity and integrity for individual forms of being that<br />guaranteed to each its own particular character."" (332)""<br /><br />&gt; ""Central to Herder’s thinking was the idea that every living form of<br />existence worked out its own mode of being, constituted partly from an<br />inner germ or seed, and partly from the environment where it appeared,<br />and on which it nurtured itself. In the human world this notion<br />applied equally to individuals and to collectivities, notably<br />nations.""<br /><br />&gt; ""Thus human history was an organic process of development and<br />interaction, part of the larger schema of nature, within which<br />everything lived out the process of becoming what it was.""<br /><br />* ""Herder developed a voting of human communities developing out of a<br />common seed. The consequences of this S said was that the self's<br />capacity for reflection could be diminished. But it was not gone from<br />Herder's theory.<br /><br />&gt; But reflectivity was an essential element in it all the same, since any life-form that developed according to an inner principle exhibited a conceptual unity between all the stages of its history: each moment was a mirror of all the others, and of the self-constituting purpose that was their common germ. Moreover, the world where individuals were formed was animated by inner purposive- ness too; thus there was something outside individuals that displayed the principle of their own being back to them, strengthening their integrity. The material being and the relational content that constituted the non- reflective dimensions of the self had, each in its way, a reflective character, so that in some degree the two non-reflective dimensions were taken up into reflectivity. (333)""<br /><br />* ""This view of Herder's was closely linked to the view of Bildung: ""as<br />a process of personal formation in which the singular potential<br />inherent in particular individuals could find realization in the<br />world: life in society helped bring the self to cognizance of its own<br />needs and powers because the persons and conditions it encountered<br />there helped to reveal the inner structure of its own being."" (333)""<br /><br /><br /><br />* ""But Herder was not as e.g. Taylor has implied rejecting universality.<br />""Every individuality has its own shape and destiny in Herder’s view,<br />but humanity is a quality shared by all human beings, and exhibited in<br />every human culture..."" (334)""<br /><br />* ""S says that Herder felt isolated as a result of his academic success.<br />Unlike Kant who was able to merge his Protestantism into the new mode<br />of autonomy implied by Bildung and Kultur, Herder felt more isolated<br />and reacted against a kind of cosmopolitanism. (334)""<br /><br />&gt; ""Herder developed these notions into a theory of universal powers or<br />forces (Kr ̈afte) that operated everywhere in the universe""<br /><br /><br /><br />&gt; ""Herder made it into what Michael Beddow has called “an ontological<br />postulate, the metaphysical ground of phenomena.”""<br /><br />&gt; ""The most fundamental powers, or Urkr ̈afte, never become part of<br />experience, but they forever work beneath it, making every object and<br />being in the universe the product of dynamic processes that follow an<br />innate principle. What distinguished the bearers of these powers from<br />Leibnizian monads was that in Herder’s universe beings and substances<br />could communicate with and influence each other. As each entity<br />developed, it drew on those around it, taking sustenance from them,<br />and enriching its own being through what it found nurturing in theirs.<br />In this way Herder portrayed the whole of existence as “a colossal<br />organism, a whole which is constituted by the complex interactions of<br />countless subordinate entities, each of which is in itself organic in<br />nature.”3""<br /><br />* ""The presentation of a world organism undergirded by such ontological<br />forces erased the distinction that Kant had tried to crea te between<br />nature and reason. (335)""<br /><br />&gt; ""for Kant the realm of material nature to which such phenomena<br />belonged had to be sharply separated from the sphere of reason.<br />Herder’s chief point was that the two realms were really one, since<br />the same deep powers of purposiveness operated everywhere. Nature thus<br />became, as for Aristotle, the ground of both physics and metaphysics,<br />endowed with active powers that pressed toward the transcendence of<br />their own materiality. Human life, in providing the stage where this<br />play of forces found its fullest expression, also opened a window on<br />the larger cosmic drama that made it possible. “For the individual to<br />express his own nature is to participate in the expression of the<br />cosmic whole: each person’s self-realization is part of the<br />realization of the vast system of interactions that is the<br />universe.”5""<br /><br /><br /><br />&gt; ""Diderot like Rousseau regarded the impress of social relations on<br />individuals as denaturing, imposing forms of living and thinking<br />foreign to people’s inner needs (as in the case of Rameau’s nephew,<br />and to some degree in his own); hence he favored the kind of strong,<br />even “despotic” inner organization that kept external influences at<br />bay, the condition achieved by Doctor Bordeu, or by the ideal actor.<br />By contrast, Herder’s openness to a positive valuation of the power<br />external situations exercised over individuals was what allowed him to<br />theorize cultural difference in a way that pointed toward modern<br />ethnographic anthropology.""<br /><br /><br /><br />&gt; ""From this perspective Herder saw individuals as deeply stamped with<br />the influence of the world around them, but he also insisted that any<br />per- son’s character developed from its own inner springs""<br /><br /><br /><br />* ""S argues that although Herder included a sense of the way individuals<br />develop themselves, his accounts of the influence of culture on the<br />individual were far better developed. (338)""<br /><br /><br /><br />&gt; ""To introduce individual differences on behalf of collective ones was<br />typical of Herder’s thought: the passage cited above in which he spoke<br />in the first person about assimilat- ing only what is “akin to my<br />nature” was a preface to “The Greek adopts as much of the Roman, the<br />Roman of the Greek, as he needs for him- self . . . the rest falls to<br />the earth,” followed by other collective instances. In the few places<br />where he referred to questions of individual psychology, he did so in<br />order to suggest the homology between individual and collective<br />experience. Thus the mind’s “tendency to build up associations between<br />what it sees and what it has seen,” on the basis of which “the mind<br />creates a progressive unity out of the multiplicity of its states,”<br />was mentioned as a springboard for a discussion of its larger<br />counterpart, namely “the chain of unity” and continuity between<br />generations. The ability of individuals to unify their experiences<br />served as both a vehicle and an analogy for the unification of the<br />experience of the whole human race through education and culture.<br />“Each individual as a human being is capable of consciously grasping<br />the chain of continuity within his own life. Each individual is son or<br />daughter, molded by education; consequently he or she receives from<br />the earliest moments in life part of the cultural treasures of the<br />ancestral heritage.” The same power of unification that operates in<br />individual life operates for the species: “I can do no act, think no<br />thought, which in some measure has not some effect on the<br />inexhaustible fullness of my own life; neither is there any other<br />being of my species whose acts and thoughts do not in some way affect<br />the whole species and its progressive development.” Human existence<br />was like a great sea in which every act or thought made a wave whose<br />motion was transmitted to the whole.14""<br /><br /><br /><br />* ""Herder's rresentatipn of the s elf, though, was based in a sense of<br />the self's weakness and their need for assistance in self development.<br />That assistance comes in the form of the education that humans alone<br />provide and which depends on the fa ulty of reason. So: ""Culture,<br />therefore, in all its senses, is the goal nature has in mind for<br />humanity when she gives reason to human beings. And it is reason that<br />triumphs in history and culture, for Herder no less than for Kant.""<br />(342) this then is where overlap exists between Kant and Herder, on a<br />sense of reason and culture emerging out of a basic purposiveness<br />existing in nature. (342)""<br /><br /><br /><br />* ""Here S argues that despite Herder's polemics against reason in e.g.<br />yet Another Philosophy of History that reason was key to the force<br />underlying historical development in his work. (343)<br /><br />&gt; Thus there are firm grounds for concluding that the self-referential prin- ciple of development Herder saw operative in both individuals and col- lectivities rested on reason as an essential agent of its reflectivity. Herder never quite said, as Leibniz had, that the model for the substantive unity exhibited by monadic existences was rational selfhood, but there are many intimations of this in the citations given above. In taking from their envi- ronment what will nourish them and rejecting the rest, human individuals and groups are like plants and animals; but in the human case this inde- pendence was powered by a rational principle that was also independent of mere passion, and that would eventually realize its inherent power to give a specifically human form to life. This vision would find many echoes in Herder’s successors. (343)""<br /><br />* ""Now Humboldt takes up his account of Humboldt who he sees as<br />developing the opposite side of the coin vv Herder, ie ""developing the<br />homology between self and world in order to ascribe to selves the<br />powers and values that Herder assigned principally to culture.""

On the most general level, Humboldt<br />believed that two interconnected conditions were necessary for<br />realizing “the true end of man,” w""<br /><br />&gt; ""The first necessity was freedom, the second “variety of situations.”""<br /><br />&gt; ""Human diversity was a product of freedom, since left to themselves<br />people naturally develop in distinct ways, but it was also a<br />precondition for freedom’s ability to bring humanity to its goal,<br />because only variety overcomes a certain tendency to one-sidedness in<br />human existence. This potential narrowness had both a psychological<br />and a social mode. Psychologically it derived from the need to<br />concentrate on one thing at a time in order to develop our talents and<br />energies, engaging in a single form of activity at any given moment.<br />Such concentration can be limiting, but each individual has the<br />capacity to ward off that danger “by bringing into spontaneous<br />cooperation, at each period of his life, the dying sparks of one<br />activity, and those which the future will kindle,” and by engaging in<br />activities that call on different personal capacities at the same<br />time. (""<br /><br />&gt; ""rich collective resources of all the others.”21 Here the formative<br />benefits that individuals derive from social rela- tions run parallel<br />to ones they can procure by virtue of their own inner powers; we will<br />return to this point in a moment.""<br /><br /><br /><br />&gt; ""In a way Humboldt fits Charles Taylor’s description of a person for<br />whom “my humanity is something unique, not equivalent to yours” better<br />than Herder: in principle the notion that specific forms of life<br />absorb what can nurture their particular nature from things around<br />them, and ignore what cannot, applied to languages and cultures for<br />both; but Humboldt seems seldom to have employed it that way,<br />concentrating much more on individuals, and there were times when he<br />described what language provided not as nurture from without but as a<br />spur to the discovery of inner personal resources. He justified<br />individual withdrawal for the sake of self-development (and acted on<br />his own principle) in ways Herder would not have done.""<br /><br /><br /><br />&gt; ""For this reason the narrative of selfhood provided in the novel<br />mostly passes over certain questions we encountered in figures dealt<br />with so far – about where the self ’s stability or unity comes from<br />and how fully they can be attained, or about the persisting tensions<br />between its elements or dimensions. It does, however, foreshadow some<br />later treatments of selfhood as above all a question of personal<br />identity, a fit between inner nature and outer station.""<br /><br /><br /><br />&gt; ""What allows the self to progress from the first of these phases to<br />the sec- ond, from pre-reflective existence to reflective being, is<br />the self’s activity. It is in the activity through which we interact<br />with the world and with others that we come to know ourselves: “we are<br />only really able to observe or eaves- drop on ourselves when we are<br />engaged in activity.” The notion that the self makes its being visible<br />in the world through its activity is just what Herder’s image of<br />entities whose lives express their inner forces or powers entails. For<br />Goethe as for Herder, activity can issue in an undistorted manifesta-<br />tion of an individual’s inner nature because the world where action<br />takes""<br /><br /><br /><br />&gt; ""place is isomorphic with the individual life-forms that together<br />constitute it: their path to self-development and self-understanding<br />runs through a world whose form of being corresponds to their own. For<br />both writers, this structural relation between self and world means<br />that the former comes to know itself in knowing its limits, since it<br />must find itself in a world whose existence transcends its own.""<br /><br />&gt; ""By bringing the two currents together, Fichte would produce an image<br />of the self as pure activity; just for that reason it would possess<br />the power to explode the limits his predecessors had ascribed to it.""</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>## Epilogue</p>
<p>* I read quickly here, but he seems to end with a great deal of enthusiasm for Freud, whose account of the self I think appeals to him 1) because it was multi-dimensional, and 2) it held a mirror up to the hidden recesses of the pscyhe without requiring the kind of critical arrogance and assumption of an ""outside"" psotion that he criticizes of those who see the self as totally invaded by external (cultural) forces, see p.11.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>## **Critical Comments**</p>
<p>* At several points here it becomes apparent that part of Siegel's preference for multi-dimensional accounts of the self, and his three dimensional schema for thinking about the self, is an intention to include, tentatively, the biological/corporeal domain.&nbsp; In the Epilogue, he refers to a sense that biology has a role in augmenting certain domains of kjowledge that bear upon the self -- ie the body and sociology-- but he is hesitant to leap in this direction. He seems appropriately skeptical. (652) Still, his inclusion of the biological domain -- his openness to it -- is (somewhat like the Critical Realists like Margaret Archer, David Elder-Vass, and Andrew Sayer -- a way to reassert a domain distinct from the cultural, which thinkers like Foucault, etc might be perceived to allow to encompass everything -- or at least I suspect that would be his concern I suspect.</p>

Antiromantic Romanticism: Sapir's Critique of American Individualism,"<p>p.073-75  Sapir's attack on ""romanticism""</p>
<p>H quotes Sapir in ""The Grammarian and His Language"" proclaiming his allegiance to the discipline of linguistics and celebrating its ""classical spirit"" which expressed itself in the ""freedom in restraint"" that he found in disicplines like lingusitics, mathematics and music.  He contrasts that classical spirit with the ""romanticism"" or ""frenetic desire"" that is ""rampant in America today."" (73)</p>
<p>[Note: Freedom in restraint sounds like the German idea of freedom?]</p>
<p>But H describes this as an ""anti-romantic romanticism"".  What Sapir means by romanticism is the same which Whyndam Lewis criticized as something sentimantal and emotional, ""a self-indulget habit of mind or a tendency to shut the eyes to what is unpleasent, in favour of things arbitrarily chosen for their falttering pleasantness."" (quoted on 74...)</p>
<p>But H then connects this to ""Romanticism"" as it is understood by ""literary histoirans and critics"" e.g. M.L. Abrams in his <em>The Mirror and the Lamp</em>.  [Note: I.e. H picks up the adversarial strain in romanticism which is also common to modernism, which in some strains grew out of romanticism, although recognizing greater ocmplexity by realizing that the source of transcendence was not simply to be found by intuitively connecting onself to Nature.]</p>
<p>So H says: ""Self-expression, creativity, sincerity, spontaneity, the foundaitonal rather than merely decorative role of metaphor, technique as perosnal discovery rather than traditional canon: these themese that Abrams finds at the heart of romanticism are central to Sapir's aesthetic theory and are prominanet as well in his anthropology and linguistics."" (74)</p>
<p>H asserts although without much evidence that this ""romantic strain has obvious connects to Herder and the German romantic tradition, and it came to modern American anthropology by way of Franz Boas."" (75)</p>
<p>H says that the romantic strain in terms of a desire for an organic culture emerges i ""Culture, Genuine and Spurious"" only to dissapear later, giving way to ""increasing distress concerning what he saw as the spurious--and romantic, in Lewis's sense--individualism of modern American culture."" (75)  Sapir's critique of American indivdiualism, H says, in turn had to do with the romantic's cultiation of anti-self-conscoiusness, which H gets from Geoffrey Hartman's 1970 article ""Anti-Self-Consciousness"" in Harold Bloom, ed., Romanticism and Consciousness, 46-56.)</p>

The Radicalism of the American Revolution,"<p>C Part II -- Republicanism</p>
<p>VI. The Republicanization of Modernity</p>
<p>* Starts this section this way: ""In the end the disintegration of the traditional eighteenth-century monarchical society of paternal and dependent relationships prepared the way for the emergence of the liberal, democratic, capitalistic world of the early nineteenth century."" (95)</p>
<p>* It was ""republicanism"" that destroyed the monarchical society, Wood says.  (95)  But it was a gradual process.  Wood says that in the eighteenth-century republicanism ""seeped everywhere"" and ""eroded"" monarchical society ""from within, wearing away all the traditional supports of kingship, ultimately desacralizing monarchy to the point where, as David Hume observed, 'the mere name of the king commands little respect; and to talk of a <em>king</em> as God's vice-regent on earth, or to give him any of these magnificent titles which formerly dazled manking, would but excite laughter."" (95)</p>
<p>* What happened basically was that republicanism was able to coexist with monarchicacal government.  (96)  So although republicans opposed monarchical society, but their goal was to ""enlighten and improve monarchy, not cut off the heads of kings."" (96)  This is not to ssay that Republicanism was not a radical ideology--it was--but it was not developed in this fashion--ie in the fashion of Jefferson who famously distinguished between monarchists and republicans:  ""the sickly, weakly, timid man, fears the peopoe and is a Tory by nature.   The healthy, strong and bold, cherishes them, is formed a Whig by nature."" (97)</p>
<p>* Montesquieu a key theorist of who set out the opposing priniciples of monarchism and republicanism for an enlightened age.  (97-98)</p>
<p>* In many ways, republican principles had already had their iimpact even on the more absolutist monarchies of the continent by the 18th century.  And England's government was even more republican.  ""Already by the beginning of the century the English monarchy had lost much of its sacred aura.  The man-made dynastic alterations of 1688 and 1714 and the rationalizing of religion inevitably weakened the sense of hereditary mystique, and the restrictions Parliament placed on the crown's prerogatives and finances diminished the kings's ability to act independently.  Neither George I nor George II seemed to care about the monarchy's public image, and both kings tended to avoid displaying the trappings of royalty.... "" (98)  So Wood concludes that the English who believed they lived in a ""limited"" monarchy in fact lived in a republican one.  (98)</p>
<p>* 99-100 Wood again repeats his point that republicanism worked from within, was not a doctrine of the radicals (thoguh it was a radical doctrine) but was espoused by monarchists and tories as well as whigs.  Wood puts it this way:  republicanism ""thus became an important current in its own right that blended and mingled with the monarchical mainstream and influenced its color, tone, and direction."" (99)  So it did not ""displace"" monarchism; it ""transformed"" it.  (99) But those who espoused it--who praised its presence in important works of art like Mozart's <em>Marriage of Figaro</em> or James Thompson's whiggish poem <em>The Seasons</em> or Jacques-Louis David's severe classical painitng <em>The Oath of the Horatii</em>--did not know that they were weakening monarchical government.  (100)</p>
<p>* Now Wood asserts ""In essence republicanism was the ideology of the Enlightenment...In the eighteenth century to be enlightened was to be interested in antiquity, and to be interested in antiquity was to be interested in republicanism."" (100)</p>
<p>* From 100-104, he shows how this tradition of ideas emerged--known as ""civic humanism"" or 'classical-republicanism""--from classical texts.  And he compares the republican interset in Rome in particular to the 20th century's interest in ""some South Sea tribes..."" (101)  Out of thsi came a literature of social criticism so pervasive that ""all the great eighteenth-century British writers spoke in republican tones."" (102)  So as a result classical conceptions of leadership became the present conception of leadership.  Cato and Cincero were the main models.  So that ""public morality was classical morality."" (103)</p>
<p>* Wood's definition of republicanism the begins here on 103-5.  Republicanism assumezs that man is a political being.  So public liberty or what we now call ""positive liberty"" involved participation in government.   Political liberty in turn ensured personal or private liberty.  So that positive and negative freedom were both wrapped up in republicanism.  Liberty was ""realized when citizens were virtuous--that is, willing to sacrifice their private interests for the sake of the community, including serving in public office without pecuniary rewards."" (104)  And this kind of virtue could only exist in a society of ""equal, active, and independent citizens."" (104)  The burden of public service thus put a great burden on individuals, both to serve and to serve in a ""disinterested"" manner--not uninterested, but disinterested.  Because republics required virtue, they were fragile and ""extremely liable to corruption."" (105)  ""In their purest form they had no adhesives, no bonds holding them together, except their citizens' volutnary patriotism and willingness to obey public authority."" (105)</p>
<p>* Although it was a radical tradition, wood notes, it ""retained a traditional patrician bias in regard to officeholding.""  (106)  The sense was that only those of the ""better sort"" (106)  should hold office.</p>
<p>* At the same time, the character of the leaders was also preoblematic.  Their ability as leaders also made them potential tyrants.  So the tension was between putting men capable of virtue in office, and then making sure that the remained virtuous.  ""Controlling and channeling the overweening passions of these extraordinary men--the aristocratic passions of avarice and ambition: 'the Love of Power and the Love of Money,' as Benjamin Franklin called them--seemed to many to be the central poltiical problem of the age."" (108)</p>
<p>VII - Truncated Society</p>
<p>* Wood starts off that the colonies only needed to bring republicanism to the surface in 1776, not invent it.  (109)  Republicanism was so engrained in English society by the 1770s, that the colonists could see themeselves as acting as good Englishmen by resisting tyranny.  (110)</p>
<p>* At the same time, in turning to republican principles the colonists did express the most republican and Whiggish strains of the ideology.  ""For they were in fact the most republican of people in the English-speaking world.  Every visitor to the new world sensed it.""  (110)  This had to do with the ""conditions of their society..."" (110)</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1) Many colonists had no reason to feel part of ""His Majesty's realm"".  Many white immigrants were not from England and settled far away from centers of British allegiance.  Some settlers from other parts of the British Isles had historical greivances with the king.  (110)</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2) Even many of the English were not good monarchists.  New Englanders ""ritualistically recalled their seventeenth-century Puritan heritage of defiance to king and church..."" (110)  But even in the South there wasn't much sense of ""royal majesty"" because the crown was just too far away (111)</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3) Royal authority, Wood says, operated on the surface of colonial society ""making the confused reality of decetnralized instituitons and localized authorities that mde up the central governance of the colonies."" (111)  Religious authority was confused and this did not reinforce royal authority (111-112)</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">4) But the big one was: ""the weakness and incompleteness of America's social hierarchy."" (112)  Baiscally what Wood describes is how the local aristocracy--which lacked the dukes, marquesses, the court, and the fabulous wealth of England was not only unimpressive, but had trouble maintaining itsself in the way artistocracy should.  They had trouble for instance maintaioning their independence from the marketplace and living off of rents from the land that was what allowed the artistocracy in England to live so leisurely a life (113).   Wood goes into the diffiuclties with maintaining contorl of land in some detail 113-118.  They also had trouble living up to the classical ideal of leadership (118) and theri authority was regularly challenged dbecause it was easier int he colonies for common people to claim the status of gentlemen.  (118-119)</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">5) The lower part of English society was also absent in the colonies--""the great mass of destitute people that still burdened most European societies."" (122)  At its highest, the proportion of poor could be as much as 10%, but this did not compare to the numbers in Hanoverian England ""where as much as half the population was regularly or at least occasionally dependent on charity for subistence."" (122)  By contrast, Wood says ""most American farmers owned their land.""  (123)  And he says this gave the colonists a ""sense of their egalitrian exceptioanlism."" (123)  In the colonies he says 2/3 of the opulatino owned land whereas only 1/5 did in England.  (123).  The propertyless in America tended to be either recent immigrants or the young.  (123)  The widespread state of freehold in the country was so significant because as William KNox put it freehold tenure ""exludes all ideas of subordination and dependence."" (quoted on 123).</p>
<p>* So America seemed primed for Republicanism and yet it was also backward, which meant that the lack of market relations made it harder for the colonoists to ""substitute imperonsl market exchanges and a cashnexus for older personal and patriarchal conceptions; and they were more apt than Englishman to continue to think of social relationships in familial and personal terms--as expressions of the household rather than ofa market society."" (124)  All in all though ""the connectedness of colonial society--its capacity to bind one person to another--was exceedingly fragiel and vulnerable to challenge."" (124)</p>
<p>VII  -- skipping</p>
<p>IX - Englightened Paternialism</p>
<p>* All throughout the eighteenth-century Anglo-American world, ""traditional authority was brought into question.  Personal and social realtions were not working properly.  The social hierarchy seemed less natural, less ordained by God, and more arbitrary.  (145)</p>
<p>* Wood notes that by 1770s, entering students at Harvard and Yale were not ranked by social status. (145)</p>
<p>* He says that everywhere ""ordinary people were no longer willing to play their accustomed roles int he hiearchy, no longer willing to follow their callings, no longer wiling o restrucit there consumption of goods."" (145-146).</p>
<p>(skipping notes in most of the chapter)...</p>
<p>X - Revolution</p>
<p>* The Revolution ""brought to the surface the republican tendences of American life."" (169)  Wood says that the high rate of freehold meant that America was ""naturally made"" for republicanism. (169)  But the revolution was not simply about ""bringing American culture more into line with the soicety.""  it was also about abolishing the vestages of monarchy and creating ""once and for all new, enlightened republican relationship among people."" (169)</p>
<p>* The South Carolina physicain and historian David Ramsay said that people were changed from ""subjects to citizens: ""Subjects look up to a master, but citizens are so far equal, that none have hereditary rights superior to others.  Each citiezne of af ree state contains, within himself, by nature and the constitution, as much fo the common sovereignty as another."" (quoted on 169)  So this was the basis of the idea of different human relationships.</p>
<p>* <strong>Key part of Wood's arguemnt comes here:</strong> this revolution was nto driven by poverty or ""seething social discontent."" (Here he's disagreeing with thsoe like the Progerssive hstiroians who have tried to see it that way...to see it in th elight of the French Revolution.)  The colonies provided the greatest prosperity in the world already for most people.  That prosperity ""contributed to the unprecedented eighteenth-century sense taht peopel here and now were capable of ordering their own reality."" (169)  As a consequence, Wood says there was a ""great deal of ealousy and touchiness everywhere, for what could be made could be unamde; the people were acutely nervous about their prosperity and the liberty that seemed to make it possible."" (170)  As traditional social relationships based on patronage and paternalism eroded, more people were xperience ing the ""anxietiesw of freedom and indepdenence."" (170)  After the 1740s, luxury was increasing and so was religious dissent, and the society was becoming more unequal.  But ""social classes based on occuaption or wealth did not set themselves against one another, for no classes in this modern sense yet existed.  <strong>The society was becoming more unequal, but its unequalities were not the source of the instability and anxiety</strong>. <strong>Indeed, it was the pervasive equality of American society that was causing the problems...""</strong> (170)</p>
<p>* The meaning of labor was shifting as part of this.  There was for the first time the idea that labor could be good, that hardwork could lead to wealth, whereas it had always been associated with poverty and servitude.  (171) But int he colonies, hard working famers were extraordinarily free.  (171)</p>
<p>* Example of the touchiness in Moses Cooper of Glocester, who had worked and become a gentlemen.  But Britiain's mercantile restrictions could threaten his success.  (172)</p>
<p>* So the colonies bittle stegan to see the choice between freedom and slavery very starkly and they ""repeatedly put into words their widespread sense that very little stood between their prosperous freedom and out-and-out oppression."" (173)</p>
<p>* Also, in a society in which slavery was so present, they had many example.  (173)</p>
<p>*  Their concerns were also exagerated by the decay of traditonal forms of authority and speed of social change.  They didnt' know what form the ufture would take.  (173)</p>
<p>* There was also an increase in political activity, but thsi was not caused bya  push up from below, but by competitions between local gentry competing for the support of the people by invoking whig rhetoric.  (173)  But this politicization persisted.</p>
<p>* Royal authority tried to squash increased politicization before 1763, but failed, and then after 1763 these ""efforts became hopelessly entangled in the government's attempt to reform its awkwardly structured empire."" (174) And at this point ""all parts of British policy"" seemed to work against the colonists' increased republican expectations of liberty.  (174) At thhis point, with the republican rhetoric of corruption, the crown's actions appeared to make the crown just another ""private interest"" as John Adams put it.  (see 175).</p>
<p>*<strong> Another key assertion:</strong> ""by adopting the language of the radical whig opposition and by attacking the monarchical abuse of family influence and patronage,"" the Americans were ""tearing at the bonds holding the traditional monarchical society together.""  And crucially their assault was ""as much social as it was political."" (175)</p>
<p>* The opposotion was not between poor v. rich or workers v. employers, but patriots v. courtiers.  Courtiers were those whoauthority came from above, from rank.  Patriots loved their country and were also free and indepdenent.  (176-7)</p>
<p>* The loyalists, about 1/2 million, fled during the reovlt at an extraordinarly high rate, and the effect of thsi was to speed the destruction of the local chains of traditional authority at the top of which stood families like the DeLancey's, the Peysters, the Waltons, and the Crugers in NY and so on.  (176-7)</p>
<p>* The people who took their place were unable to create the same ""chains of family and patronage."" <strong> So that post-revolutioanry society was ""inevitably put together on new republican terms.  Social and business links formed during the war and after were thinner and more precarious, less emotoianl and mroe calculating than they had been.  The liens of interest and influence created by the Revolution were looser and less personal, based less on kin and mor on devotion to the patriot cause or wealth alone."" (177)0</strong></p>
<p>* And removing those ""clusterse of perosnal and familial influence"" became the ""idealistic goal of the revolutionaries."" (177) Their emerged a ""revulsion against corruption and the use of patronage..."" (178)  So the purpose of the Virginia constitution eg was to ""prevent the undue and overhwlmming influence of great landholders in elections."" (quoted on 178).  The goal was at the same time to promote independence, so Jefferson """"proposed in 1776 that the new state of Virginia grant fifty acres ofland to every man that did not have that many.""  (179)  The Revolution, Wood says, ""became a full-scale assault on dependency."" (179) I twas in this context that John Adams sated taht ""there are but two sorts of men in the world, freemen and slaves."" (quoted on 179)</p>
<p>* The revolutionaries did not expect that the poor would become leaders, but that ""the sons of humble or ungenteel men, if they   had abilities, would, as they had, acquire liberal and gentelle crepublcian attributes, perhaps by attending Harvard or the Colelge of New Jersey at Princeton,a nd would thereby rise... ""(180)</p>
<p>*  All the revolutionary state constitutions struck at the power of family and herditary privilege...abolishing the legal devices of primogeniture and entail... (182-3)  In this way the Revolution changed the old patterns of inheritance.  <strong>In aprticular, they recognized the rights of daughters and windows to inherit property!!</strong> (183)  Women's ability to own property was strengthened.</p>
<p>* The practice of servitude became anachronistic and anti-republican.  Masteres, Wood notes, became more employers, retial merchants, or businessmen. (185)  The revolution did not abolish black slavery but it did Wood insists make it ""escruciatingly conspicuous in a way that it had not been in the older monarchical society... "" (186)  Now it became clear that slavery was an aberration, a ""peculiar institution."" (186)</p>
<p>* <strong>KEY</strong>:  Becaiuse all citizens now thought to be equally free, there was a rdical change in the conception of state power.  The earlier talk of ""paternal or maternal government, filial allegiance, and mutual contractual obligations between rulers and ruled"" was gone.  New notiosn of ""public power"" emerged (187)  Popular consent became the ""exclusive justification for the exercise of authority by all parts of the government... "" (187)  ""In republican America government would no longer be merely private property and private interests writ large as it had been in the colonial period.  Public and private spheres that earlier ahd been mingled were now to be separated."" (187)    The local legislatureswere now ""sovereign embodimetns of the people with a responsiblity <strong>to promote a unitary public interest</strong> that was to be clearly distinguishable from the many private interests of the society."" (187)  So the lcoal governments created new plans for public interest.  The ""carved out exclusively public spheres of action and responsiblity where none had existed before."" (188)  so they made plans to improve trade and commere and roads and waterworkds and so son... (188)  They set up new authorities with paid staff paid by public taxes.  NY set up such an authority to mange steets and wharves.  The city of NY acquired the right of eminent domain and Wood says the power of the state to take private property ""was now viewed as virutally unlimited--as long as the property was taken for exclusively public purposes. "" (188)</p>
<p>* The new organizatino of public sovereign power raised the question: ""wehther the people's personal rights could emaningfully exist apart fromthe people's sovereign power--the general will expressed in their assemblies.  In other words, did it any longer make senes to speak of negative lbierty where the people's positive liberty was complete and supreme?""   (189)  Indeed, ""limiting popular government and protecting private property and minority rights without at the same time denying the sovereign public power of the people became the great dilemma of political leaders in the new republic; indeed, it remains the great dilemma of America's constituional democracy."" (189)</p>"
"Ethnic Diversity, Cosmopolitanism, and the Emergence of the American Liberal Intelligentsia","<p>Notes Feb 2012:</p>
<p>The idea here is that intellectuals like R. Bourne who laid out a ""cosmpolitan ideal"" in early twentieth century US were working ""with rather than against, the drift of history"" in laying out a cosmpolitan idea that helped constitute what Hollinger calls a ""national, secular, ethnically-diverse, left-of-center intelligentsia."" (134)&nbsp; That liberal intelligentsia he says had become prominent in American life by the 1940s with its obvious leaders being Edmund Wilson, Lionel Trilling, and Dwight Macdonald (literary); David Riseman and Daniel Bell (sociological); Reinhold Niebuhr and Sidney Hoook (philosophical essayists.)&nbsp; Their ""dicourse"" he says was ""institutionalized"" in the ""liberal arts divisions of major universities"" and in jouranls like the <em>New Republic, </em>the <em>Partisan Review</em>, <em>Commentary, </em>the <em>Nation</em>, and then eventually in the <em>New York Review of Books</em> and the <em>New York Times Book Review</em>.&nbsp; Hollinger thinks that this group maintained its powerful influence througout the 1940s, 50s, and 60s, and that it was so powerful that all people who thought of themselves as ""intellectuals"" saw themelves as members of this group or its audience.&nbsp; Most importantly, this libreal intelligentsia was half Jewish and half WASP.&nbsp; (134)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hollinger defines the cosmpolitan ideal in a couple that these pole held in a couple of places, first on 135 where he describes it as a ""desire to transcend the limitations of any and all particularisms in order to achieve a more complete human experience and a more complete understanding of that experience."" (135)&nbsp; In addition he says that the ideal was counter to the ""eradciation of cultural differences"" but was also ""counter to their preservation in parochial form."" (135)&nbsp; Particular ""cultures and subcultures"" Hollinger explains were instead seen as ""repositories for insights and experiences that can be drawn upon in the interests of a more comprehensive outlook on the world."" (135)&nbsp; When H revisits the definition of the ideal again on 150, he adds some other layers.&nbsp; Here he emphasizes that it involved ideas about the ""spiritual capacities of individuals"" and their relationship to culture or subcultures:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The opportunities presented by life were felt to be broader than a choice between various particularisms (whether in the form of ideologies, religious traditions, or folkways). It was believed possible for human beings of diverse experience to put together a perspective on the world more authentic, reliable, and satisfying than any perspective generated by the intensification of a narrowly constricted range of experience. There was no reason in principle, it was assumed, why an individual could not have Whitman's multitudes within him or her and yet be able to achieve the stability required to enjoy those multitudes and to set priorities among them; similarly, it was hoped that a subculture could be complex and variegated without losings its integrity.&nbsp; In other words, the cosmpolitan ideal implicitly attributed to people the ability to confront, absorb, and profit from experience not only qualitatively differnet from, but <em>quantiatively greater</em> than that of any given provincial existence. (150)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Hollinger the critique that must be made of this cosmopolitanism is that it among those who held this view it coexisted with an elitist doubt that the population at large was capable of the kind of ""growth"" beyond parochial points of view that the cosmpolitan ideal entailed.&nbsp; The ideal was thus destined to remain the special discusive position of this liberal intelligentsia.&nbsp; An understanding of the central role this cosmpoltian ideal plaid in constituting the self-conception of this liberal intelligentsia had itself been obscured from view by a focus on the theme of intellectual ""alienation"" from mainstream culture (ie Cowley's Exiles Return) that reinforced the distinction between intellectuals and ""regular Americans."" (151)&nbsp; A key historiographical point of the article is that this theme of alienation has received too much attention, and is the chosen theme of many of these intellectuals themlves, but that it does not repsresnet the positive system of values that held this group together.

Thoreau's Militant Conscience,"<p>00 Summary 00</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Lucida Grande',Verdana,sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"">Read an article by N Rosenblum about Thoreau's ""militancy"". She defines militancy as against militarism, which would be conformity to a hierearchy, as quite the opposite: a revolt against passivity, resignation, and unoformity (87). It was in Emerson as a spiritual state, but T takes it farther making it ""manifestly agressive."" (87). It is wrapped up with his view that the state is totally illegitimate, even in its laws. He is totally antiinstitutional and the ""State"" is his target. T stood apart from that, but did not root his conscience in any universalizable maxim, but rather on his own inique genius. (98). So ""Thoreau accepts nonconformity, even eccentricity, as sure proof of the essence of conscience..."" (98). So that Thoreau ultimately was ""not engaged in a quest for a collective ideal."" (101). Three things politically in T's militancy: approval of violence in addition to passive disobediance; intolerance becausw ""conviction made tolerance inconceivable."" (102); and antiinstitutionalism. The latter puts emphasos on solitary rather than collective actions. (103). Thoreau's militancy is political; it is nit just a call for a reurn to purity and withdrawl; its aim is to change the world (105-6). But he provides no ""alternate vision of the state or community"" (106). It is instead a vision of permanent antagonism and struggle (106). Rosenblum suggests that this ""militancy"" is a distinct ""unified stance toward the world"" that appears at different times. She doesn't like it much: ""It is the last resort of political-minded souls who refuse to regret their own powerlessness and incomprehension."" (106</span></p>"
"Canonizing Dewey: Naturalism, Loical Empiricism, and the Idea of American Philosophy","<p>Notes 11/2011</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jewett notes the attention paid by historians of philosophy and social sciene to the rise of ""value-neutrality"" as a way of enhancing professioanl authority.&nbsp; But&nbsp; he notes that ""as yet...we lack a systematic analysis of alternative epistemologies and their political functions in modern America.""&nbsp; (92)&nbsp; In this article, he wants to talk about how the ""Columbia naturalists"" confronted the arrival of logical empiricism in America as a part of that attempt to tell a story about such alternative epistemologies.&nbsp; (92) &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The logical empiricists--ie originally the austrian Rudolf Carnap, his German counterpart Hans Reichenbach, and others--were ""militantly scientific and politically left-wing"" as were their adversaries in the Columbia naturalist movement.&nbsp; Philosphically, they had an inclination toward ""noncognitivism"": ""a theory holding that ethical judgements contain no cognitive content and thus present a fundamentally different kind of claim than do scientific statements."" (93)&nbsp; The Columbia naturalists, who followed the work of Dewey and Frederick J.E. Woodbridge, thought this stance on ethics un-democratic.&nbsp; They thought that the logical empiricists viewed ""value judgements and little more than idiosyncrasies, bearning no relation to the scientist's empirical investigations and logical reasoning.""&nbsp; (94)&nbsp; That empirical orientation isolated philosophers from public discourse.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In order for philsophers to fulfill their democratic responsibilities, the argument continued, they needed to recogniye that value judgements were profoundly social and publicy observable entities with future referents--in short, that these judgements expressed changes sought, states of affairs desire. (94)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nagel attempted to forge a link between logical empiricism and American naturalism, but this attempt failed.&nbsp; ""W.V.O. Quine and other Harvard figures codified a new philosophical paradigm and relegated the synthetic, publicly oreinted stlye of the Columbia naturalists, along with their specific understandings of nature, science, values, and human agency. to the margins of the field."" (94)&nbsp; Meanwhile, the Columbia natualists continued to portray their approahc as the more ""American"" and ""democratic.""&nbsp; But in a final turn, ""a very different taxononmy of philosophers"" became central during the Cold War: one which pitted a ""non-normative 'analytic tradition' of Britain and the United States against a 'Continental Tradition' populated by Hegel, Marx, Heidegger,a nd other European critics of politically netural scholarship."" (94)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Critique:</p>
<p>More detailed notes</p>
<p>* American naturalism, J says, showed well the ""intellectual convergence of liberal Protestants and the children of Jewish immigrants..."" (94)&nbsp; On the one hand, Randall, Schneider, Edman, Friess, and guttman were related somehow to ministeres.&nbsp; J says that the ""students of Dewey and Woodbridge aimed to provide an alternative to churches as a sourece of spiritual guidance."" (95) He also points out that they followed in many way the tradtion of religious humanism represented by E.A. Burtt at Cornell and A. Eustace Haydon, Edward Scribner Ames, and Henry Nelson Wieman at U Chicago.&nbsp; (95)&nbsp; He points to the 1933 Humanist Manifesto that Dewez, Burtt, Randall, and Haydon sgined.&nbsp; ((95)&nbsp; But then he notes that the second- generation of Columbia naturalists worked even more closely with New York's many Jewish naturalists, such as Sidney Hook, a student of Dewey's who taught at New York University, and the Jamesian pluralist Horace M. Kallen at the New School for Social Research."" (96)&nbsp; These men were attacking ""Catholic neo-Thomist, neo-orthodox Protestants, and other 'authoritarian' thinkers during World-War II."" (96)&nbsp; Pphilosophicl naturalism ""took on a distinctly militant cast in Depression-era New York, and the personnel were increasingly of Jewish descent.""&nbsp; And by the late 1930s he says Dewey who was seen as an enemy of democray by Catholics was invovled with Hook in a ""double-barrrelled attack on Catholicism and Stalinism."" (96)</p>
<p>*&nbsp; The starting point of Columbia's second-generation naturalists was Dewey's instrumental pragmatism.&nbsp; (96)&nbsp; This was ""predicated on a reading of Darwinian biology that made a prominent place in nature for minds, values, and other 'immaterial' objects."" (96)&nbsp; Insofar as this view involved naturalism it was ore subtle and implied simply, as Edman put it, ""a fatih in the unity of nature or substance, of which all life is a derivation, upon which all action is posited, and within which the structure of mechanism is seen to be simply a systematized technique of practice and of economical understanding."" (quotd on 96)&nbsp; Dewey saw immaterial entites like minds and ideals as occupying the same realm as material objecst and figured that he could take such a view in sofar as ""minds were funcitons or phases of organisms, separable analytically, but not concretely, from bodies."" (96)&nbsp; So Columbia naturalists interpreted this kind of naturalism as empirical and not that form of naturalism taht was reductively materialistic.&nbsp; (96)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* These second generation Columbia naturalists also adopted Dewey's politics, J says.&nbsp; Ie his attempt to preserve social science from becoming an ""adjuct to capitalist power--as had the natural sciences in his view."" (97)&nbsp; As such, Dewey attacked both Lockean empiricism and the fact/value separation.&nbsp; He saw empiricism as the ""philosophy of the commercial middle class..."" (97) It like Smith's political economy he thought sustained ""economic individualism"". (97) In ethics, he struck at the idea that normative commitments were ""transcendent and absolute"" as was maintaine by Hume as well as religious traditionalists.&nbsp; This he thought made normative commitments ""impervious to scientific advances, to social upheavals such as industrialization, and to empirically grounded criticism."" (97)&nbsp; Above all it segregated society from the ""critical impact of scientific inquiry..."" (97)</p>

"The Soul's Economy: Market Society and Selfhood in American Thought, 1820 - 1920","<p>p.207-8 Politics and ideolgoy and social change</p>
<p>Sklansky now explains the ideological shifts that this social transformation produced.  Here he returns to Cooley and interestingly also his father: Thom McIntryre Cooley, who he says was a ""leading exponent of the federal judiciary's sustained effort to appy the classical principles of private property and free enterprise to a society increasingly dominated by corporate capital."" (207)</p>
<p>This led to a doctrine of ""substantive due process"" though which ""connsitutitnoal protections of life, liberty, and property formerly reserved for individuals were gradually conferred upon business corporations. (207)</p>
<p>Sklansky now brings up a recent revision of the history of laissez-faire constituitonalism...which has shown that it was ""guided not simply by sympathy for big business, as earlier scholars [such as?] contended, but by a deeper allegiance to the Jacksonian ideology of the free market and the neutral state.""  Sklansky explains: ""The sovreign self, torn form its roots in the early republic of freeholders, found a new hom in the sysnthesis of economic individualism and corporate property that is the enduring legacy of Thomas Cooley and his contemporaries on the bench."" (207)</p>
<p>Against this background, Charles Cooley (Thomas' son) and his notion of a social self (+like minded social scientists) produced a ""rival model of the relation between self and society, predicated upon the principle of 'interdependence,' as opposed to independence."" (207)</p>
<p><strong>Sklansky central point </strong>here though is that there is less daylight between these two positions that one would immediately assume.  Responding to the concentration of capital and wage labor, T. Cooley had disavowed older ""liberal-republican precepts of natural right and social contract"" henotes.  He had found in ""Anglo-American common law tradition an organicist vision of a society founded upon common customs, habits, and values"" and from this he develoepd a ""sociological basis for the regulatory state, of which he was both a preeminent theorist and, as the first chair of the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), a leading practitioner."" (208)  HE formulated the idea of the state's ""police power"" to regulate corporate conduct.</p>
<p>It was from this set of ideas in T. Cooley's thinking that Sklansky argues Ch. Cooley--who had begun his career working for his father at the ICC--developed the new theory of social seflhood.  And here is Sklansky's central critique again: Saying that C. Cooley emphasized a ""society governed by 'self-expression' rather than 'self-interest,'"" he notes that in doing so ""he also deliberately shifted the stakes of social struggle away from political and economic rights and twoard psychosocialnorms, desires, and needs, away from proprietary claims upon productive resources and toward cutlural claims upon selfhood and moral agency.  The social self that he created was therefore ironically compatible with wage labor and corporate capital in ways that hte sovereign self  it supplanted was not.  Much as Thomas Cooley's common-law rationale for the regulatory state was integrally related to his constitutional legitimation of corporate property, so Charles Cooley's social pscyhology was wedded in complex ways to the logic of corproate capitalism.  Together, Thomas Cooley's reconstruction of property and sovereignty along with Chalres Cooley's reconstruction of selfhood encapsulated the broader shift from political economy to social psychology as the master science of American society."" (208-9)</p>"
Professions and Patriarchy,"<p>Chapter 1</p>
<p>Witz's argument in a nutshell is as follows: Gender relations within  the professions cannot be understood without the concept of patriarchy.   If one is to understand patriarhcy in the context of the professions,  the best way to conceive of their realtion is through the dual-system  theories which suggest a kind of harmony (rather than opposition)  between patriarchy, professionalisation, and capitalism.  I.e. there is a  kid of ""partnership"" developed her.  Hartman 1979 is her favorited  theorist on this: ""Capitalism grew on top of patriarchy; patriarchal  capitalism is stratified society par excellence...Patriarchy...shapes  the form modern capitalism takes, just as the devleompent of captialism  has transofmred patriarchal institutions."" (quoted o 14).  For Hartman  the central mechanism is the idea of the family wage to which ""she  accords a pivotal role in securing th ematerial bais of male dominance  in both the labour market and the family in industrial patriarchal  capitalism."" (15)  For Hartman, key source of aamle power in capitalism  was men's ability to organize in trade unions.  Hartman believes that  men's experience controlling the labor of wives and children taught them  the ""techniques of hierarchical organization and control"" that later  helped them establish similar forms of domination in the state: ""In  other words, a direct personal system of control was translated into an  indirect, impersonal system of control, mediated by society-wide  instituitons."" (quoted on 21).</p>
<p>Critiques of Hartman (Walby 1986, 1989, 1990b and Lwon 1990) have pointed out thte fat that Hartman posits too cozy a relationship between patriarchy and capitalism which excludes the possiblity of conflict between the interests of capitalists (who might want to take advantage of cheap female labor) and working-class men (who want to maintain authority in the home.) Also Witz points out that rates of trade unionism were low in the ninteenth century, whcih would suggest that patriarchal capitalism might not have existed in the nineteenth century as Hartmann suggests.  This points to the fact that men did not only <strong>exclude</strong> women but also sometimes deployed an inclusionary strategy whereby women were allowed into jobs but shunted off into lower grade and less skilled work.  (27)  Thsi is particualr relevant in the prot-industrailzation of the late 17th and early 18th centuries when women when the family was incorporated as a labor system along with the lines of control in the family.  The shift to exclusoinsary practices occured when women came to be understood as wage-earners and not subsidiary workers.

The Professionalization of Everyone?,"00 Summary Note 00 

The starting point of this article seems to be that professionalization as a term was at the time of writin g (1964) being applied very liberally to all types of occupations.  Wilensky then wants to try to understand what is in fact the process of professionalization.  He describes a somewhat regular sequence of structural developments that seemed to his research to be rather uniform.  

That process is described between 142 and 146.  Thus Wilensky writes: ""In sum, there is a typical process by which the established professions have arrived: men begin doing the work full time and stake out a jurisdiction; the early masters of the technique or adherents of the movement become concerned about standards of training and practice and set up a training school, which, if not lodged in universities at the outset, makes academic connecting within two or three decades; the teachers and activists then achieve success in promoting more effective organization, first local, then national--through either the transformation of an existing occupational association or the creation of a new one.  Toward the end, legal protection of the monopoly of skill appears; at the end, a formal code of ethics is adopted."" (146)

Important in understanding this article is Andrew Abbott's discussion of previous sociological literature on professionalism and professionalization in the Introduction to The System of Professions in which Wilensky's article figures prominently.  For Abbott, Wilensky (along with Millerson and CAplow) is a structuralist in which ""Profession was mrerely a form of occupational control; the content of work and the expert-client relation were less important.  Professionalization here became an explanation of why the professions displayed such diverse properties; the answer was that some had not finished professionalizing."" (15)  Abbott contrasts the structuralists with the functionalists (e.g. Talcott Prasons), the monopolists (Freidson and Larson) and those who saw professionalization as a form of cultural authority (e.g. Haskel and Bledstein).  (See Abbott, System of Professions 15).  Abbott's summary is really a necessary reading here in order to get at Wilensky's assumptions and limitations in relatoin to the broader literature.  A very useful survey.  He notes in particular (p.10-11) that Wilenksy does not elaborate upon what causes the steps of professionalization.  Each step in Wilensky's process Abbott points out ""drawon different general views of why things happen in social life.  Schools arise functionally; they fill a need.  Delegation of taks, by contrast, arises in a historicist manner( success confers the power to delegate, which futher enhances success), while ethics codes simply coalesce inevitably."" (10)   Ultimately, Abbott's critique leads to his analytical method of categorizing professionalizing theories, both form ""formal"" differences i.e. emplottment and presence of a central subject, versus ""substantive"" differences, e.g. functionalist, structuralist, monopolist etc... (see 13-14)."
"Spectacular Confessions: Autobiography, Performative Activism, and the Sites of Suffrage, 1905-1938","<p>1 Notes on Intro (6/27/10)</p>
<p>Just looking at this book very carefully.  Green means to examine the history of ""spectacle"" and ""performance"" in relation to the suffrage movement in England.  She explicitly thinks of this as an attempt to contribute to the rethinking ""the relations between gender, literary moderenism, and modernity.""  (8)  She is a literary scholar and so what is here is really a ""literary history of the spectacular confessions of the suffrage campaign."" (8)</p>
<p>FYI: In f.n. #11 she lists other books dealing witht he links between gender, literary modernism, and modernity: Fita Felski, <em>The Gender of Modernity</em>; Janet Lyon, ""Militant Discourse, Strange Bedfellows: Suffragettes and Vorticists before the War,"" <em>Differences</em> 4.2 (1991): 100-133; Lisa Rado, ed., <em>Rereading Modernism: New Directions in FEminist Criticism</em>.  Those are the main ones and then seh lists others that read modernism in relation to femininity: Ann Ardis, <em>New Women, New NOvels: Feminism and EArly Modernism</em>; Suzanne Clark, <em>Sentimetnal Modernism: Women Writers and the REvolution of the Word</em>; Marianne DeKovan, <em>Rich and Strange: Gender, History, Modernism</em>; Briget Elliot and Jo-Ann Wallace, <em>Women Artists and Writers: Modernist (Im)positionings</em>; Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar, <em>No Man's Land: The Place of the Woman Writer in the  Twentieth Century</em>, 3. vols; Alice Jardine, <em>Gynesis: Configurations of Woman and Modernity</em>; and Lynn Pykett, <em>Engendering Fictions: The English NOvel in Early Twentieth Century</em>.</p>
<p>I'm looking at this book mainly to try to get a sense of the link between modernism, gender, and agency/selfhood... Is there anything here?  Not sure yet.  One problem is that her modernists are suffragettes; mine are academics and not primarily activisits.  She draws a distinction (p.8) between her actors and ""high"" modernists like Ford Madox Ford, May Sinclair, Wyndham Lewis, Virginia Wooolf, REbecca WEst, HG. Well, etc etc.  She is I think drawing a distinction between her actors and the subjects and those that the works listed above deal with I think.  I'm not sure this is ogin to help me.</p>
<p>Still there is something here that is similar to what I have been thinking about.  She describes her actors in contrast to ""high modernists"" who ""wrote as detached spectators rather than as participants...""  She wants to focus on the way ""feminist suffragettes produced new dicosurses of modern spectacularity."" (9) Continuing: ""No less than the literary figures named avoe, the suffragettes engaged dominant dicourses of modernity--especially discourses of modernism's spectacular advertisements, celebriteis, and technologies.  Feminist examinations of modernism's spectacular cutlrue, hwoever, by insisting upon both performance and critique, created a spectacular politics."" (8)</p>
<p>There's something in this that relates to what I amt rying to say in Ch.4: the emphasis on an encounter with modernist selfhood that recognizes forms and then tries to subvert them for the purpose of weakning the limiting structures.  On p.9-11 of the Intro, Green takes up the question of whether militant suffragette was ""in control of her representation, in command of the street theater of suffrage.""--which is something that many studies have assumed (she cites Lisa Tickner's study and quotes from it on 9-11).  She ulimtately challenges this claim say the ""Coronation Process"" (a large suffrage march in 1911) met with ""diverse readings"" and then she shows journalist Harold Ownen's reading.  It seess it as a ""feminization of modern public space"" which is alienating.  Green then links Owne's account to andreas Huyssen's arguemnt that ""the emergence of a modernist aethetic occurs simulatneously with its drawdrawl forma feminine mass body politic and feminized mass culture..."" (11) and also with the tendency for modernism advocates to ""figure its revolutionary energy through the image of woman"" a point made by Janet Lyon in ""Women DEmonstrating Modernism.""  Green's point is that in Owen's account what has occured is that women have been triumphant but that at the same time ""the radical break into the new age is not to be embraced in [his] version of history..."" (11)  Her goal in the book then is to recognize how ""gendered narratives of modernism's emergence appeared concurrent with suffrage activism"" in a way that ""exposes the feminist strategies that employed and subverted a variety of meanings attached to the feminized mass."" (11)</p>
<p>Also useful is her thinking about ""performative activism,"" a term which she wants to ""call up speech-act theory's interest in the performative utterance that revals the word as an act; feminists theory's interest in those performances of everyday life that produce the contours of gender identity; and theatre history's interest in the shifts and changes of theatrical conventions.""  (16)  All the elements seem important to me here: the mixing of the play with theatrical convention, the individual agency of the speech-act, and the spectacle as a moment in which shared female identity is created.  The tension between the last two seem particularly important.  GReen writes: ""While  we consider how oppositional speech and autobiographical gestures produced individual feminist identities, we must also attend to the ways in which each individual utterance was intended to produce a collective feminist identity."" (16)  So these were private utterances that also were an ""expression of inter-subjective identity."" (16) See quote on 16-17 about how the movment involved a discovery of identity a ""real person that often remains throughout a life-time hidden under the mask of appearances..."" (16)  Also interesting a quote fro Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence: satating that the suffrage campaign was ""our education in that living identification of the self with the corporate whole, which means an intensification and expansion of consciousness."" (16)</p>
<p>Green's analysis of the creation of this inter-subjectivity continues from 16 onward in ways that are quite revealing through the actualo words of the suffragists.  Their ""individual"" accounts inform a collective identity that the movement is helping to unfold as the quotes above indicate.  A particular interesting moment is when Green looks at the response to Black Friday  in Nov. 1910 when police attacked a group of women and allowed them to be beaten by an angry mob.  Aftewards the Women's Press created their own ""evidence"" in a text that was submitted to the Home Office.  Green analyzes this and shows that ""[t]he women's testimony concentrated upon the parallels between these brutal beatings and a sexual assualt."" (21)  The evicdence presetned first-person accounts but where the identity of the individual was protected i.e. (the info was presented by say ""Miss C"").  The utliamte effect Green says was that these accounts that layered ""medical discourse, legal dicourse, 'experience,' and a scopic rigime in which the exposure of injruies to the feminine body would always positiont hat body within the register of sexualized dicosure, all functioned to <strong>complicate the 'tansparency' of these autobiographical accounts and to clarify that woman's body [i.e. not individual bodies] is the ground upon which struggle for respresentation in the body politic takes place."" </strong>(21)  This seems particularly helpful to me because that is what one can see in the Lowell poem too: the woman is generic...she is clealry a woman in the way she is limited by the patterned conveiotns of her dress, her location in the garden, her postion of waiting for her fiance, etc.  Her identity as an ""individual"" one could almost say is similarly protected, whereas her problem as a woman is put at the center.  Green develops this further by looking at Joan Scott's essay ""Experience""  from <em>FEminists Theorize the Political</em>.  SCott's issue is the ""intersection between histories of marginalized subjects and the evidence of first person experience."" Scott apparently argues that revisionist history is undewritten by an idea of ""knowledge"" ""gained through vision"" or ""a direct, unmediated apprehension of the world of transparent objects""...This is a metaphor of ""transparency"" has given the legitimacy of the ""experience"" of previously unacknowledged historical subjects its legitimacy and has fueled the challenge to ""normative history,"" which is seen as having an ""incomplete vision.""  But this is Ithink Scott thingks is a flawed challenge so Green writes that Scott argues that to not treat evidence as self-evident (quoting Scott) ""we need to atten to the historical processes that, through dicourse, position subjects and produce their experiences.  IT is not individuals who have experience, but subjects who are constituted through experience."" (Scott 22)  So it is ""experience"" that rather than being the ground of explanation is the thing that needs to be explained.  AS a theory of doing history this is great, but it is also useful for understanding the modernist consiousness that I am describing in Ch.4...this shift away from theindividual to the constiuted experience of a subjet...for the anths as for contemporary historians it is culture that is constituting experience...</p>"
The Clash of Civilizations?,"p.022-23 Phase theory of history leading to this moment

Huntington has a veritable stage-theory of history here.  But it does not lead to an answer but in this case a new era of conflict of a distinct sort.

Here's the basic assertion: ""Conflict between civilizations will be the latest phase in the evolution of conflict in the modern world."" (22) Then he traces a history beginning with the Peace of Westphalia and ending with the end of the Cold War.  First for a century and a half after the Peace of Westphalia he says conflicts were between princes ""attempting to expand their bureacuracies, their armies,their mercantalist economic strength and, most important, the territory they rulesd."" (23)  He thinks that they ""[i]n the process they created nation states, and beginning with the French Revolution the principle lines of conflict were bewteen nations rather than princes."" (23) In RR. Palmer's words of 1793 these were wars of ""poeples"" (23)  This period lasted until WWI at which point ""as a resutl of the Russian Revolution and the reaction against it, the conflict of nations yielded to the conflict of ideologies, first among communism, facism-Nazism and liberal democracy, and then between communism and liberal democracy.  During the Cold War, this latter conflict became embodied in the struggle between the two superpowers, neither of wich was a nation state in the classical European sense and each of which defined its identity in terms of its ideology."" (23)

All these conflicts he says finally were ""primarily conflicts within Western civilization"" (23).  He notes that William Lind has called them ""Western civil wars."" (23)  But with the end of the Cold War he argues ""international politics moves out of its Western phase, and its center-piece becomes the interaction bewteen the West and the non-Western civilizations and among non-Western civilizations."" (23) 

Most interestingly he argues that there is a epistemic shift here between the West and its others. Basically the west loses its Other.  These Others become, along with the western states, the subjects or ""shapers"" of history: 
""In the politics of civilizaitons, the peoples and governments of non-Western civilizations no longer remain the objects of history as targets of Western colonialism but joint the West as movers and shapers of history."" (23)"
Introduction,"<p>pp. 3-9 Ross' Definition of Modernism</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ross starts with the ""problematic definition of modernism.""&nbsp; She begins the discussion with Kant's distinction bbetween scientific knowledge and aesthetic judgement.&nbsp; Romantics tried to ""annul the separation and reverse the hierarchy, starting a quarrel that contines to the present day."" (3)&nbsp; This ""quarrel"" continued with the ""separations and relations between the scientifically oreinted successors to Englightenment reason and the modernist heirs of Romantic aestheticism..."" (3)</p>
<p>So she starst here discussion with H. Stuart Hughes' <em>Consciousness and Society: The Reconstruction of European Social Thought, 1890-1930</em> (1958).&nbsp; Hughes' concern is a ""cognitive revolution"" focused on the prolbem of the subjectivity of consciousness.&nbsp; Hughes is defending the humanist Englightenment tradition at a time in the 1950s when there is a sharp divide between positivism and aesthetic modernism.&nbsp; (4)&nbsp; Huges, thought, saw the 1890s generation that had effected this revolution and their ationality as emotion/irattionality.&nbsp; Freud the main example.&nbsp; Weber the hero who tired to hld together ""the cognition of the irrational and the insistence on rigorous scientific procedures."" (Huges' quoted on 5)</p>
<p>Huges also included a chapter on artistic modernism.&nbsp; On Stein, Pound, Eliot, Joyce and Yeats...tracing their genealogy bck to French symbolists and Baudelaire.&nbsp; Nietzsche and the ""relativizing philosophers, psychologists, and therists of science"" also influencing them.&nbsp; Here Ross says Hughes' center and periphery are reversed...the above artists are the center and the philosophers, pscyhologsits and theorists of science are ""adjuncts."" But she says its the same problem: ""the subjectivity of perception and cognition, a subjectivity that calls into question the unity of the observing subject as well as its relationship with the outside world.&nbsp; The now problematic character of representation leads modern art to formal innovation and a reflexive stance.""&nbsp; Yet modernist art's turn to fractured subjectivity is not emotion but ""rather the inward path of aesthetic ocnsicousness.&nbsp; Aesthetic subjectivity, by its creative reconstruction of the world, becomes the source of whateer integrity and transcendence is available to the modern person."" (6)</p>
<p>Aeshtetic subjectivity's ""context"" Ross says is understood to be the ""artist's radical sense of alienation from modern society."" E.g. Baudelai're evolt against philistine 19th-century city.&nbsp; Nietzsche's revolt against bourgeois society.&nbsp; So a turn away from ""the world of democracy, bureacuratic organization, specialied functions, and industrial capitalism."" (7)&nbsp; a ""moral and aesthetic revolut against the existing conditions of cultural-social life."" (7)</p>
<p>Modernist's linked alienation to a ""reconfiguration of historical time."" (7)&nbsp; They rejected the present world and argued that ""historical continuity had been broken.""&nbsp; They imbibe historicism, an understanding of history that understands history as a ""process of qualitivative change, moved and ordered by foces that ay within itself."" (7)&nbsp; This yields moral relativism and ""risked transforming the novelty and uncertain of historical cange into chaotic flux.""&nbsp; (7)&nbsp; If one placed the ""historian in that flux"" it ""calledinto questoin the entire historiogrpahic enterprise."" (7)&nbsp; Thsu in 1890s a ""crisis of historicism"" emerges with increasing historical relavitivism.&nbsp; But the sense of alienation brings it up in a big way: ""The modernist revulstion against contemporary bourgeois society was necessarily also a rejection of the progressive historicismin which it was grounded."" (7)</p>

She points out that these methods were not only a reaction to but helped to engender ""mass society.""  She notes that people have already observed this period as one in which a ""truly national public was bolstered...by the popular culture of radio and film, the joining together of idfferent ethnic groups in the unions of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, the spike in citizenship rates after the curtailing of immigration in 1924, wartime bond drives, and anticommunist rhetoric. ... What, however, of the impact of knowledge about 'ourselves'--all the more potent for its status, not as entertainment propaganda, but as truth?

Lost Manhood Found: Male Sexual Impotence and Victorian Culture in the United States,"00 Summarial Note 00

Mumford traces shifting conceptions of manhood and male sexuality through what he funnily terms ""impotence discourse"" (34, see also 33 where he states purpose of essay) .  He notes two big shifts occuring in 1830, the time of the Second Great Awakening, and 1920.  In 1830, he argues that sexuality was divorced from reproduction (with which it had until then been linked) and impotence was understood as a ""divine curse"" that struck both men and women.  (34-35)  There was then a  shift away from that view which gradually linked impotence to ""overcivilization"" and this was the product of medical professionals and reformers.  (35)  Finally in 1920, impotence was reconfigured as a psychological problem, a problem of repressed drives.  This went along with a basic shift in the sex/gender system toward companionate marriage (35, 54-56).  This last shift Mumford argues had the ""dual effect of undermining's women's sexual authority and reinforcing inequalities of difference."" (36)  

Questions:
This is a good article, but I have some questions:
1) He describes at one point an ""emergent model of sex difference that counterpoised the irrational and uncontrollable female body with the rational male body."" (41)  This being an ""emergent"" ideal is interesting.  Is this really a 19th century phenomenon.  Does he mean particulalry the emphasis on body?  That could be, for he says just before that Chalres Rosenberg and Anthony Rotundo ""have suggested that hte new construction of masculinity emphasized the body: they argue that the eighteenth-century ideal of 'publik Usefulness' gradually gave way to a more indivdualized 'physical ideal of manliness.'"" (41)"
The Vanishing Subject: Early Psychology and Literary Modernism,"Summary Note

Ryan tries to ""view modernism afresh through the eyes of empiricism"" (22) in this book.  What she mean by empiricism here is the ""empirical"" approach to psychology that she
argues generated a new approach to the self between 1880 and 1940,
especially in Germany, the U.S. and England.  This approach, which was to be distinguished from an earlier approach which presumed that the ""character"" of the indivdiual was visible through that individual's behavior (6-7), threatened the stability, 
consistency, and discreteness of the self as she explains in detail in her first chapter,
""The New Psychologies.""  Wundt's attempt to deploy the experimental method in psychology in 1860s helped produce this shift by new focus on ""senses,"" but ultimately these other movements moved away from Wundt.  Key figures were Franz Brentano, Ernst Mach, and William James.  Each applied a ""phenomenological"" method to the problem of subjectivity, which tended to undermine sharp distinction between subject and object, to see them as being linked together in different ways.  These ideas, she argues, ultimately influenced the literature of this period, and her argument is, i nfact, that this empircist approach had a greater influence on literature than Freud's psychology, which she describes as being more deeply rooted in a specific attempt to reconstitute the individual self, even if as a weaker entity.  Her description of Freud is interesting (see 16-22), basically she is saying that these other guys entertained more radical views on pscyhology, in which the self was all but gone."
The Subject of Liberty: Toward a Feminist Theory of Freedom,"p.29-30  She will Mix Positive and Negative Liberty

Negative liberty models have probem: They can't examine the social sources of the systematic nature of power systems, such as patriarchy.  

She explains this via the example of rape.  The way it is prosecuted, for instance, women that are gang raped are imagined to be raped by a series of indivdiuals as opposed to ""by a collectivity, much less by patriarchy...""  She continues ""...individual rapists live and operate within a cultural context that makes rape a conceivable and even acceptable act, that in effect 'enables' the action...."" (29)  etc etc.  

She also points out that patriarchal ideas  of sexuality, in fact, deny that such a thing as rape even exists, for some patriarchal men, it is just men having sex with women.  

So she says a femnist approach to freedom requires, even in negative liberty models, an expansion of the concept of ""external barriers."" (30)  Then once one does this this opens futher questions about ""how external factors shape the internal self, how restraint and opportunity form and influence desire, preference, and choice.""   So she wants to explore relations btw inner and outer forms of fredom. she says (30)

She will mix positive and negative liberty: ""Like classic negative-liberty theorists, I maintain that the ability to make choices and act on them is the basic condition for freedom.  However, like positive-liberty theorists, I maintain that choice needs to be understood in terms of the desriing subject, of her preferences, her will, and identity.  For subjectivity exists in social contexts of relations, practices, policies and institutions that affect and shape desires [note: social construction].""  (30)"

<ul class=""notes"">
<li id=""i1259"">------------p.016 CHAPTER 1 --------------------</li>
<li id=""i1912"">
<p>00 Summary 00 Critique: Manganaro is explicit in linking the ""culture concept"" = the holistic idea of culture as a ""complex whole"" with anthropology. E.g. ""On Tylor's part, while his definition of culture as 'complex whole' provides the template for anthropology's central and defining concept... "" (4 Another instance in which Manganaro generalizes regarding ""modern anthropologists"" holistic use of culutre: ""And yet this mistake is intellectualy understandable, given the tendency in formative usages of culture toward containment--for Arnold, of anarchy; for modern anthropologists, of the disparate acts, practices and mentalities of a people into a comprehensible 'complex whole.'"" (17)</p>
</li>
<li id=""i2097"">
<p>p.001-3 Culture's Vagueness v. Institutional Value of Defining it Manganaro starts out the work typically by noting the vagueness of culture via an essay on it by Greenblatt which considers its value for literary analysis. (1) Greenblatt says it is problematic b/c too vague and then offers a more limited definition. Manganaro then notes that Greenblatt's move is in the vein of most of those that have written about culture: ""[Greenblatt] effectively rehearses the veyr rehtorical position that has compelled writers since Tylor, including T.S. Eliot, Clifford Geertz, and Greenblatt himself, to continue to work with the term: that the term <em>culture</em> is too loose and large and needs 'definition.'"" (1) Manganaro then points out that although ""the battening of the term to a fixed institutional meaning becomes necessary for the legitimacy of the profession"" there is something unique in that the term's vagueness makes it ""institutionally productive or disciplinarily rich"" to seek to limit it.

<li id=""i2357"">
<p>p.002 Culture and Humanist Decline Narratives Bruce Robbins he says has noted the link between culture and a ""professional logic"" relating to narratives of humanistic decline that served the claims that only a few recalled the glories of the culture. Robbins apparently has linked anthropology to the literary professions through the notion of ""salvage"" where the profession is ""sustained by protest against the repetitious disappearance, which it thus has an interest in sustaining or constructing."" (Robbins' words, 2) Thi sis from Robbins' book Secular Vocations: Intellectuals Professionalism, Culture... That link very strong in Arnold who closely linked the notions of culture's decline with its definition, i.e. ""Gerald Graff makes the astute observation that once culture as concept was articulated by Arnold and those who followed him, it was already necessarily indicating its own absence..."" (2) So ""the very pronouncement of <em>culture</em> is only possible throug the articulation of <em>anarchy</em>"" (2) See bottom 4 and also 5-6 in particular for how Arnold enables and describes lit crit ""profession"" via the decline of culture.</p>

<li id=""i2211"">
<p>p.006-7 Book is an examination of culture concept AND Anglo-Am. Modernism Starts with ""Victorian archtects of culture"" and moves through Boas and his sduents to ""modernist literary artists"" such as Eliot, Joyce. Then Malinowki and modernist lit. critics like Eliot, I.A. Richards, and the New Critics Cleanth Boroks, Allen Tate, and John Crowe Ransom)... He focuses on culture as a ""central idea or term"" but also other key oncepts eg. myth, metaphor, narrative, irony, function... these he sees as ""attends to but as <em>displacements of</em> and even versions of culture."" (6) He will focus on the variety of usages in these preiods. (see 7, top), but also he emphasizes the continuity: ""Th traffic in culture inaugurated by Arnold and tylor and made seminal to instiutitonal revolution and consolidation by Malinowski and Eliot has a common ground in Tylor's founding anthropological definiition, that is, culture as a 'complex whle' of human institutions, customs, and practices. The continuity here is in the important modernist tropes of complexity and wholeness he says: ""The generativeness of tylor's founding definition, what enables cutlure's mobility in effect, is the necesssity of the interworking of its parts: complexity necessitates wholeness, and wholeneess makes possible complexity. In a consequent and common (though significantly variable) institutional turn, tribes and poems get read as complex wholes whose meaning, as decoded by institutionally based specialists, rsides in the interrelation of intricate parts.""

<p>P.058 Malinowski's main disciplinary oppoent: British diffusionists</p>
<p>see 58 and f.n. #9. Thes oppensn were British diffusionists Elliot Smith and William James perry.&nbsp; Their so called neo-diffusionism.&nbsp; Perry's Children of the Sun that focused on the ""'world-wide spread of culture' from its origins in the Paleolithic Age..."" (58)&nbsp; Malinowski was fighting this.&nbsp; Manganaro is getting this from Stocking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li id=""i1271"">
<p>p.059 Central theme of <em>Argonauts </em>culture's dissapearance</p>
<p>M writes: ""...what brackets <em>Argonauts</em> is word portending the disappearance of culture, words that in their sculpting of distintegration call for the salvage job of the culture reader.&nbsp; Malinowski's opening lines--'Ethnology is in the sadly ludicrous, not to say tragic, position, that at the very moment when it begins to put its workshop in order, to forge its proper tools, to start ready for work on its appointed task, the material of its study melts away with hopeless rapidity' (xv)...""</p>
<p>So the goal is to rescue culture...Manganaro says...""in order to make life worth living.""&nbsp; In last paragraph of <em>Argonauts</em>, Malinowski puts it in terms of WWI, need for tolerance for undrstanding the ""essential outlook of others..."" (quotd on 59).</p>
<p>But what Manganaro points out is that this call for tolerance is in fact said to be achieved through the creation of a hiearchical conception of cultue: in particular in asserting a difference between his appraoch to culture and an ""idle hunting after curios""...i.e. an amateurish approach to anthropology (60).&nbsp; So Malinowski's influence he thinks has to do with his notoin of the power of fieldwork the ""secret of effective fieldwork"" which he called the ""Ethnographer's magic"".&nbsp; So the use of certian rules, methods, systematic analysis...(61).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li id=""i2194"">
<p>p.061-62 Holistic Theme also only apparent to professional</p>
<p>Manganaro extends his theme: the professional, rather than the amateur is able to see the hole structure of the tribe.&nbsp; With his """"tables of kinship terms, genealogies, maps, plans, and diagrams, proves the existence of an extensive and big organization."" (quoted on 62)</p>
<p>It is the professional for Malinowski that is able to grasp the whole, to generate a creative synthesis, to realize the whole... (63)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li id=""i1219"">
<p>p.063-4&nbsp; Similiarity between T.S. Elliot's and Malinowski's views of creative function?</p>
<p>Manganaro compares Malinowski's approach to T.S. Elliot's notion ofthe poet who achieves excelence not through something new but in the ""rigorous implementation of a 'mechanism of sensibility that could devour any kind of experience' and thus for whom 'experiences are always forming new wholes.'"" (64)&nbsp; For both Elliot and Malinowski he ays, the ""process of making 'whole' is an artisinal, hard-won activity invovling procedures of the 'synthesis' or transmutation of the ordinary as well as extraordinary human experience..."" (64)</p>
<p>Also Manganaro sees a conection between their notions of individual...in relation to tradition.&nbsp; As in Eliot's essay, the individual talen works out itssel fin relatio to the tradiotn.&nbsp; LIek this, he says Malinowski was interested in how the indivdual expresses somethig not as indviduals but in ""what they feel and think qua members of a given community."" (quoted on 64).</p>
</li>
<li id=""i1520"">p.003-5 Anthropology's part... He uses Stocking's comment that Arnold's conceptoiinof culture was ""in some ways closer to the anthropological sense of the term than is Tylor's own use of it."" (Stocking's words, quoted on 3). He's drawing hereon work by Chirstopher Herbert, ""Culture and Anomie: Ethnographic Imagination in the Nineteenth-Century"". The link Herbbert sees is between Arnold's notion of ""right reason"" as ""looking forward to the anthropological notion of culture as 'that body of thought which supposedly emanated from the collectivity as a whole.'"" (3) ...the tie being here fore Herbert that ""right reason"" comes entirely from society and has no ""transcendental point of reference""&gt; (3) Then M goes back to Tylor saying his ""definition of culture as 'complex whole' provides the template for anthropology's central and defining concept"" (4) and then notes that Tylor's evolutionary aspect was soon rejected by ""modern anthropologists"" e.g. Boas and Malinowski. (5) NOTE: It's as if he totally sidelines the significance of evolutionary theory as a temporary glitch... this appears to be very teleological.</li>
<li id=""i1200"">
<p class=""plaintext"">p.005-6 Both Anth &amp; LitCrit Establish themselves via Culture M's point against Greenblatt is that ""...the decline and fall of literature, as fashioned by Arnold, makes the profession of literary criticism, much as modern anthropologists construct, according to James Clifford, 'the disappearnace of their objects,' those 'primitive' tribes whose survival, at least in the words of ethnography, depends upon and hence legitimates the anthropologist."" (6)</p>
</li>
<li id=""i1423"">p.007-8 1922 He says the book's ""center of gravity"" is 1922. The Waste Land and Ulysses were published then, and Argonauts of the Western Pacific and R-B's The Adaman Islanders. Also W.H.R. Rivers died indiating Malinowski's victory in leading British functionalist. (7-8). Furhter defenese of this year in terms of literary profession (8) and then anthropology on (9). He mentions Boas here in terms of Boas' desire to focus on ""distinctiveness of each culture and the diffusion or spread of cultural traits from one neighboring cultural area to another."" (9) He aruges this same conflict is ""read into the arrangement and critical reception of The Waste Land and Ulysses."" (9) Then also finds similar emphasis on a focus on detail, a supension of ""narrative historical realm"" and a plunging into ""myth"" and ""magic"" of natives in Malinowski (9)</li>
<li id=""i1510"">p.010-11 After 1922 Here he acknowledges the variety of culture as these concepts develop in the context of attempts to professionalize. But he maintains that ""culture"" remains a ""key figure or model common to all"" and then by 1930s ""commonly regarded and used as a multifaceted, organic <em>whole</em>, the relation of whose parts generate a comprehensive <em>menaing</em> that is, significantly, held to be greater than the sum of its parts."" (10) As professionalization increases, his study will look more at the spread of htis model. The way models of modernist critics as ""inhering in, structuring, or animating the literary text not only resemble the anthropological concept of culture but actually operate as displacements of, replacement for, the anthropological concept, not shuttled to the <em>literary</em> realm (and often, asin the case of Allen Tate, used as a tool againstthe influence of science in the modern age."" (12) NOTE: This is very interesting in terms of the spread of culture and its jurisdiction. It spreads and then is replaced and taken over... Wow!</li>
<li id=""i2367"">p.012-13 So while he admits that culture can ""seem a thing of 'shreds and patches'"" (quote is from Lowie's Primitive Society regarding culture, not the concept of culture, which M has already cited on 11) -- he also wants to suggest ""some significant filiations of ideas both <em>within</em> and <em>between</em> the professions of anthropology and literary study."" (12) On 13 he suggests that the an important sublogic of the idea that ""gets variously worked out within and bewteeen the disicplines"" is an way of interepreting the term that works against diachronic and instead ""works synchronically to delve into the relams of the mythiccal and the magical, whether Malinowski's conception of myth as charter or Elito's 'mythical method.' As such <em>magic</em> becomes boht a province or areae of study--what people from other places and time do--and a mode of analysis."" (13)</li>
<li id=""i1829"">p.017 Eliot drawing on Anthropology Manganaro talks about Eliot's drawing upon anthropology to get to a concept of the cutlural whole or cutlure as a ""way of life."" Notes that Eliot had written an essay on ""The interpretation of Primitive Rtiual"" in grad school. (18) Much more info here too. (18-19). Then Manganaro claims that ""Eliot's coneptualization of the 'local' unit indeed would not have been conceivable without the by then powerful anthropological legacy of Boas."" (19) Manganaro then spends a few sentences discussing Boas' 1887 critique of Americanc evolutionists, and here he simply implies that the idea that Boas stated that social data must be considered in relation to their social context necessary implies a holistic version of this concept... or at least he seems to imply this, see 19, 3rd full paragraph.</li>
<li id=""i1641"">p.050-55 End of Ch. is ode to Eliot Here Manganaro seems to be more positive about Eliot...here it's almost as if the tension between decay and his ""brilliant suturing of antique mythic forms to contemporary 'reality' bits."" (52) So M is kind of defending Eliot from those earliest critics who disliked Eliot's negativity about modernity (he talks about them on 50-51). He sees him as envisioning a ""World Culture"" (53) of ""Greek myth, contemporary pop music, modern French verse, Elizabethan history, tarot cards, the Bible, obscene folk song, and the Grail quest,..."" (53) M's seeing a more ""postmodern"" : that is though in Notes Eliot puts forward idea of a ""World Culture"", M sees Eliot's poem as most powerfully supporting a vision of the ""<em>waste land</em> as spintered postmodern landscape..."" (53) In other words, M here reads Eliot suddenly against the critique of him as an elitists, nationalistic, fascist with a negative view o fmodernity. He also downplays what he notes is the ""isomorphism of culture to land"" (see 50, first para. of new section and 53).</li>

"Social Scientists and the Culture Concept, 1930-1950: The Conflict Between Processual and Structural Approaches","00 Summary Note 00 

This essay traces what Matthews refers to as a ""major change in the basic assumptions of American social science which took place between 1930 and 1950"" that involved the notion of ""Culture"" becoming ""centarl, in a new and different meaning, by the even of World War II."" (87)  Matthews articulates this
shift between two ""ideal-type"" frameworks within which he says sociologists interpreted data: the processual and the structural.  What he is tracking here then is a shift from the processual to the structural, where the structural is expressed through a new emphasis on culture.  Among these new emphases Matthews lists the rise of ""interpretive apartuses"" such as Freud and Marx, the ""pattenred configuraitonal model of culture offered by Columbia Anthropology"" (e.g. Benedict), the ""equilibrium analysis of Talcott Praosn, and the ""neo-Aristotelianism and neo-Thomism of Chicago humanism of chiacgo humanism"" (88).  

Whereas the processual focused on the individual as the fundamental social unit, the structural tended to focus on institutions.  It understood reality as existing and as being in flux.  It ran close to American nationalism.  (88-90).  The structural by contrast emphasized the stability and ""integration"" of the ""whole.""  Matthews is particularly good at indicating other movements in the30s and 40s including the New Criticism in literature and others that paralelled Benedict's ideas (93).  He traces this new structural epmhasis first in Benedcit's theories, importantly noting that whereas Ogburn's cultural lag (rooted in the processual theory) had been ""impatient with the redundancy or overelaboration of intangible culture beyond funcitonal needs, Benedict had praised its richness and achivement.""  Moreover he notes: ""Benedict saw customs, forms of association and artistic expression as an envelope of meaning, an essential protection against the incoherence and psychic terror produced by rapid change."" (93)  He cites her ""cups of clay"".  Then he traces a second and more influential structuralism which is that of the strutural funcitonalists in which Durkheim is the important influence. (94-95)  Finally, he traces a thrid and later moment in which the processual view came back in a bit, e.g. the Cultural History moment that came atthe 1939 AHA and Carolin Ware'es published edited volume that resulted on ""The cultural Approach to History."" (96)

Finally, Matthews examines the causes of this transformation.  1) He thinks thecontext of the Depression and radical change created a need for systems that woudl be resistant to radical change. 2)  He also interstingly cites an internal pressure to critque old theories as a part of the professional process.  3) In term s of stimuli in the ""broad external field of contemporary intellectual history"" he cites a sense in which these people saw themselvres as ""intellectuals"" and thus were involved in a critique of American culture that took aim at the view which they linked to the processual theory ""of America as benevolently blank plain, as ideal ground for individual opportunity and self-development.""  (98-99)."
Do Ideas Matter in America?,"<p>Summary Note:</p>
<p>McClay's basically trying to make the argument--what a surpise--that yes ideas are important in America.&nbsp; The main or most helpful part of that argument comes in the first section, p. 67-73.&nbsp; He walks through the rejection of the consensus' historians idea that America was anti-intellectual.&nbsp; He starts his own construction of the role of ideas with the 19th century awareness of the idea that American culture was being smothered by a dead European tradition in the form of ""high culture.""&nbsp; (69)&nbsp; He makes great use of Santayan's ""The Genteel Tradition"" and the idea that the gap between the high-brow and low-brow produced a ""disordered relationship to the realm of ideas as entirely abstract and ethereal, rather than as useful instrumetns fo rmaking sense of practical experience."" (73)&nbsp; What comes next, of course, is pragmatism--""an effort to make ideas useful again."" (71) McClay emphasizes the way pragmastism was influenced by Darwinian biolgoical science: ""Human cognition was to be understood as an adaptive tool in the struggle for evolutionary survival, like the wings of a bird or the clas of a cat, and ideas themselves were compared to species whose viability can be evaluated only by testing their ability to survive in action.&nbsp; Thus, intellectual life was a ceaseless flow of challenges and adaptions, with absolutes nowhere in sight.&nbsp; Equally notable, however, was James's willingness to talk frankly in the language of lowbrows--to evaluate ideas in terms of their 'cash value' and their ability to produce fruitful outcomes."" (72)&nbsp; McClay's point is partly that pragmatism was not a radical departure from what he sees as the basic approach to ideas in America can only matter if they have a practical use...(72)--though this seems like a contradiction of his previous point via Santayana that American's couldn't see how ideas had a practical use.</p>
<p>But McClay's point is utlimately that the idea that ideas have no role in American life may have been that they are in fact respected only in practical form: ""If we do not readily preceive the pervasiveness of ideas in American history, it is for the same reason that deep-sea fish do not perceive the existence of water.&nbsp; Ideas provided the very medium within which American life is conducted.""&nbsp; (73)&nbsp; McClay's proof of this invovles him in making the argument that Americans' always related to their own nation as an idea--ie he's supporting a version of the idea of American exceptionalism, which he acknowledges frankly (74).&nbsp; I find this section a bit odd.&nbsp; It seems not to fit very tightly with his good points about pragmatism.&nbsp; It's one thing to trace the emergence of pragmatism as a distinct American philosophy out of the feeling that in America the gap between highbrow and lowbrow created a sense that ideas needed to be made practical again; it's another to make the general point that ideas were treated practically because of Americans' unique relationship to their national identity as an idea--which I do think is true to some extent.&nbsp; The argument is a bit harsh...but maybe I could accept it.</p>
<p>I do accept well the idea that ideas have a kind of practical role then--or rather that those who engage with ideas most productively and convincingly somehow do so by meshing though with activity in the market and they intellectualize or philosophize the market in unique and powerful ways, e.g. Emerson's attempt to imagine the market as the ""soul's economy.""&nbsp; Or Andrew WK even.&nbsp; Market activity can have a heady significance in the US...and perhaps this works with McClay's claims about American exceptionalism: if the idea of America is linked to its business activity, then engaging in that activity can take on a heady significance??</p>
<p>McClay thinks then that what the consensus historians saw as anti-intellectualism is actually, very differently, ""unreflexiveness."" (77)&nbsp; Hmmmmm</p>
<p>Then in the last section McClay wants to step back and look at three ""clusters of ideas"" that have formed the American ""outlook"".&nbsp; He picks science, the culture concept, and liberalism.</p>

"Consciousness and Society: The Reorientation of European Social Thought, 1890-1930","<p>001 Some Preliminary Observations</p>
<p>3-9: Assessment of what ""intellectual history"" is.&nbsp; He decides that theoretically Int. History deals with ""the thoughts and emotions of men--with reasoned argument and with passionate outburst alike."" (3)&nbsp; However, he notes that there may well be a deeper substratum in history--that discovered by the people he is studying--Freud, Marx, etc--the realm of drives and impulses.&nbsp; but this cannot be what history studies, for he says history is about change and historians' impusle to study the ""higher"" order of events is a desire to see history as a movement and evelopment, whereas this ""substratum"" of drives and impulses is about repetition.&nbsp; The subject matter of history then can only be ""what is capable of coherent explanation in logically delimited time sequences.&nbsp; And in such expalnation deed and thought are inextricably entangled."" (6)&nbsp; So he says: ""The subject matter of intellectual history, then, is 'rationalizations' of various levels of complexity."" (6)&nbsp; <strong>Here Hughes is dealing with the claims of the people that he is studying re the discovery of the impulsive ""unconscious"" dimension of human life and its role in history.&nbsp; Seems to me that this whole thrust is to acknowledge the wisdom of recognizing the existence of these forces, and yet to instist that we can find a force or pattern in history anyway--and this is a desire he finds in the thinkers he examines, though they most often fail to come up with a solution... </strong>On 6-9, he brings up the idea of there being a spirit in history or the idea that it is a rational process, both tendencies he tries to keep at an arms length without rejecting entirely.&nbsp; At the end of the section eh states that the way he has chosen the subject matter and delimited his study implies ""the existence of some such spriit.&nbsp; The effort will be to locate--at least among a selected number of thinkers--the common attitudes that together constitute the emerging critical consciousness of the early twentieth century."" (9)</p>
<p>9- : On the way he delimited his study.&nbsp; He divides intellectual hsitory into the exploration of ""high"" and ""low"" levels of thought.&nbsp; ""The first refers to intellectually clear and significant statements--the second to popular effusions in the nature of slogans."" (9)&nbsp; What is low for him is what has ""seeped down"" after some ""cultural lag.""&nbsp; (9)&nbsp; His work deals with ""high"" ideas quite explicitly.&nbsp; He breaks this down again into three categories: 1) studies of ""popular ideas and practices--with the whole vast realm of folklore and community sentiments.""&nbsp; This he sees as like anthroplogist's ethnolgoical approach. 2) What Croce called ""ethico-political"" history--""the study of the activities and aspirations of ruling minorities and of the rival minorities striving to supplant them."" (10) 3) ""the history of the enunciation and development of the ideas that eventually will inspire such governing elites.""&nbsp; This type he says ""proceeds on the aessumptiont hat only a small number of individual are actuallyr esonsible for the establishment and maintenance of civilized values..."" (10)&nbsp; The latter is the type he is diong in this study and he think ti is the <em>via regia</em> of intellectual history, since it is mainly on this level that ideas as such can be studied...ie he's after an arena in which ""ideas in their pristine form"" can be studied.&nbsp; (11)</p>
<p>12-15: Limit of his study will be ""little Europe"": essentially centural Europe...excluding countries on the Western and Eastrern pereiphery.&nbsp; The thinkers in this region he says in the genreation before WWI ""shared a wider experience of psychological <em>malaise</em>: the sense of impending doom, of old practices and institutions no longer conforming to social realities..."" (14)&nbsp; Ie he describes here a sense of ""the demise of an old society, coupled with an agaonizing uncertainty as to what the forms of the new society might prove to be..."" (14) and it is this sense that has helped him delimit his study.</p>
<p>In this period also, there's ""the end of one type of intllectual actiivty and the beginning of another."" (14)&nbsp; And this is really <strong>key!!! He sees these thinekrs as the creators of ""great inclusive systems"" and yet at the same time ""they narrowed the range through which such genearl theorizing might operate and cast doubt on the future usefulness of intelletual operations of this type.&nbsp; Thus on the one hand they figured as the last in the long succession of system-builders descending from Aristotle.&nbsp; At the same time, by leaving their systems open and by passing on to their successors fewer solid answers than unproived hypotheses to be teseted, they introduced an era of specailization in social theory and of concentration on discrete, finite problems."" (15)&nbsp; So they were ""humanists,"" but the ""rigour"" they introduced ""preducled the formation of successors in their own image..."" (15) </strong></p>
<p>Central to these thinkers' ""transitional world of ideas"" H says was the ""problem of consciousness""...ie ""it was the period in which the subjective attitude of the observer first thrust itself forward in peremptory fashion--hence the title of this study."" (15)&nbsp; Earlier he says that ""rationalists and empiricists alike agreed on an identity of view between actor and observer in the social process, and on assuming this common attitude to be that postulated by scientific investigation or utilitarian ethics."" (15)&nbsp; Now these thinkers started to ""wonder wehther these emotional invovlements, far from being merely extraneous, might not be the central element in the story."" (15)&nbsp; This produced an ""enormous heightening of intellectual self-consciosuenss... (16)&nbsp; This self-consciousness could easily turn toward ""radical skepticism"" and even anti-intellectualism.&nbsp; (17)&nbsp; In this context, Hughes notes that he thinks the greatest thinkers of this period were those ""who while fighting every step of the way to salvage as much as possible of the rationalist heritage decisively shifted the axis of that tradition to make room for the new definition of man as something more (or less) than a logically calculating animal."" (17)</p>
<p>Interstingly, Hughes cites Kroeber's <em>Configurations of Cultural Growth</em> here to say that these thinekrs reprsented a ""'cluster' of genius."" (17)</p>
<p>17-20: he talks about which thinkers constitute this generation.</p>
<p>20: He states very clearly that he's not dealing with the ""technical development"" of social science.&nbsp; ie he's doing an intellectual hitsory and thus is ""only interested in ideas that transcend the scoep of a technical intellectual pursuit and have relevance for other fields of knowledge."" (20)</p>
<p>25-&nbsp; : He deals with the quite obvious fact hta thte conclusions fo these thinkers has influenced his own decisions in the study.&nbsp; He says his ""implicit notion of what constitutese history is basically Crocean,"" but ""profoundly modified by psychoanalytic and sociological theory--things to which Croce himself was temperamentally hostile."" (25) He notes also that he is American, but his ""intellectual formation"" has been European.&nbsp; And he states that his ""own position is quite consciously 'eighteenth century'"" in that he thinks we are all ""children of the Enlightenment, and that it is from this standpoint that civilized members of Western society--the their to a human tradition more than two centuries old--almsot necessariliy&nbsp; judge the political and social movements of their own time."" (27)&nbsp;&nbsp; He quotes Ernst Cassirer on Enlightenment and self-critical analysis and says this is his own faith too.&nbsp; (27) He's not disregarding the developments since the Enlightnement as ""in vain"" but only that ""certain ethical postulates characteristic of the eighteenth century--chief among them the insistence, <em>where possible</em>, on rational solutions and human behavior--represent and abiding legacy of overriding importance..."" (28)&nbsp; Here he thinks his own interest are in-line with the people he's studied: he does not think thta these thinekrs were as hostile to the Enlightnment as they ahve sometimes been depicted. (28)&nbsp; Much of their anti-Enlightenment feeling was directed, he says, not at the 18th century Enlightnement but against ""its late nineteenth-century incarnation--in travestied form--as the cult of positivism.""

Antiromantic Romanticism: Sapir's Critique of American Individualism,"<p>p.083-91 Move to Critique of Am. Culture</p>
<p>The moment of optimism ends quickly because of the war, which although it had intiially caused some enthusiasm, ultimately produced great dismay.  He describes this using Bourne again and he cites May agian who sees Bourne as a bellweather in terms of the loss of faithin ""progress"" (83).</p>
<p>He highlights in Bourne's ""Twilight of Idols"" a critique of efficiency  ""unlinked to higher values."" He also notes that Bourne is objeting to the way the ""younger intelligentsia"" accepted values ""announced from above"" and the ""formulaito of opinion...loeft largely in the hands o fprofessaionl patriots, sensational editors, archaic radicals..."" (quoted on 84)</p>
<p>[Note: I make the same move at the end of Ch.2 (as of 12/31/09) but do I hit hard enough the efficiency/bureaucracy thing?]</p>
<p>Bourne he says puts his ""finger on anothe rproblem tha would increasingly inspire pessimism among culturla criics in the twenties: the relationship of intellectual elites to mass society and culture.""  (85)  Her ehe says Bourne and Sapir are disillusione dby the war similarly, feeling allienated by the movement of mass culture.  see 85.  Sapir is not receptive to the optimisitic enthusiasm for social engineeriing and business culture that is part of the 1920s.  He dislikes Jazz (although likes Negro Spirituals).</p>
<p>[Note: Considering Sapir's antifeminism compared to Bourne's friendship with Parsons can we really link the two here so closely?]</p>
<p>Here is where he brings in Sapir's dislike for self-consciousness.  He criticiezes Hart Crane's powetry for ""nerouvs excitement"" (86)  and critiques the ""too clever smootheness tha thas been made fashionable by Mr. T.S. Eliot."" (86).  He likes poets Edwin Arlington Robinson, H.D., Emily Dickinson, Gerard Manley Hopkins, Leonie Adams...  H says he ses in them ""sincerity, allied to,and made possible by, unself-conscoiusness."" (86)</p>
<p>H uses a review of Emily Dickinson to lay out his point of view in more detail.  He also believed interestingly that ""scientific thoght"" was a head of popular culture.  H quotes a letter to Harriet Monroe that is important.  Part of it reads; ""It is one of the most interesting ironies of cultural history that hard-headed scientific thinking (for example, in Mendelian heredity with its crhomosomes and genes; in atomic structure; in conceptions of space, time, motion, and matter) is forcing a sort of mathematical mysticism which leaves official philosophy and humanism behind as more crassly mateiral in thought than the spirit they thought they were combating as material."" (quoted o 87, letter is from 1925).</p>
<p>But Sapir did not find this ""mysiticism"" in Boas whose scientific thinking wasw ""incomple in expression"" and ""prevented by a certain fierce delicy from every declaring more than it manifestly must."" (88) But he like Boas better than ""our fashionable romantic biologists"" (88)  He disliked Bertrand Russel who he though was at home in the romantic (pejorative) age.  (88)</p>
<p>He outlined a critique of emphasis on efficiency.  H uses two reviews of books about business culture in the US to get at this point, 89.  Here H links Sapir with Alexis de Tocquevill, Matthew Arnold, and Max Weber who ""undestood that ht eAmerican religion of efficiency, which brought together 'our efficiency-experts and Methodist deacons,' as he once put it, was an unintended consequence of the secullarization of Protestant indivdiualism."" (89)  Sapir picks up themes from these poel but develops critique of American individualism which ends up producing anonymity and stifling individual's growth and self-epxression.  (see 90).</p>

Ideas and Institutions in American Anthropology: Thoughts Toward a History of the Interwar Years,"<p>[6] [Stockings' Kuhnian view of Baosians...] Stocking outs himself here as seeking to interpret the significance of Boas' ideas in terms of a Kuhnian paradigm change...  Describing the impact of Boas' ideas...  ""Indeed, one is tempted to go beyond 'reform' to 'revolution' and to suggest that this was one of those moments in the history of the social sciences that may, up to a point, be illuminated by the concept of 'paradigm' change.  Certainly, the Boasians saw themselves as scientific innovators--paraoxically, in view of the anti-scientific current in  their thinking, as the only propagators of a really 'scientific' anthropology.  Their recruitment from outside, their youth, their creation and capture of institutional bases, their close community life, their tendency to rewrite the history of the discipline--in these and other 'sociological' dimensions, their innovation had a definitely Kihnian character.  Substantively, the conceptoin of culture and of cultural determinism implicit in Boas' critique of evolutionism provided the basis for radically different disciplinary world view, although its implications were slow to be developed.""  (6)   He notes that the intellectual thrust of the Boasians could be linked with the broader movement of funcitonalism (i.e. he mentioins Durkheim, Radicliffe-Brown, and British social anthropology) but it was distinct from this movement in that Stocking says that this movement believed that like causes produced like effects, i.e. ""that social facts could be 'defined in advance by certain commo external charactersitics, that social 'species' could be classified in terms of 'the nature of the component elements and their mode of combination,' and that one well-constructed experiment offten suffices for the establishment of a law.'""  (6)  He cites Goldenweiser's review of Durkheim's Elementary Froms and Kroeber's dispute with W.H.R. Rivers as  ""retrodictible in terms of differences in paradigm assumption...""  (though he notes in the case of Kroeber what is at issue is the ""morganian current within British anthropology...and not all Boasians would have agreed with Kroeber."" (6) But Stocking also argues that ""oasian anthropology had only an imperfectly paradigmatic character..."" (6)  IT's not totally clear to me how he makes this judgement...but it seems to be the degree to which Boasian science may have had ""unity"" and developed in ordelry and logical way out of the assumptions that Boas' laid down... In paragraph on 6-7, Stockings' language expresses the idea that in a rather weak and not very obvious way it had unity and developed in a logical manner... Or he also notes in the next paragraph that there were ""moments"" when anthropological science ""had something of the 'puzzle-sovling' character of 'normal science'...""  (7) Perhaps a more complete paradigm would be thoroughly unified, and puzzle-solving... Then he suggests some alternative ways to think of this...including his ""genetic"" model... (8)   But he ends his description in this section by concluding that ""The history of American anthropology between the wars may hus be seen as the working out, in a changing intellectual and institutional context, of various implications of the position Boas had defined at the beginning of his anthorpological career."" (9)...Which would be  a Kuhnian process of paradigm change???</p>"

"The Age of Empire, 1875-1914","<p>Ch.4 - The Politics of Democracy</p>
<p> </p>
<p>* After 1870, ""it became increasingly clear that democratization of the politics of the state was quite inevitable."" (85)  Universal male suffrage already existed in France, Germany, Switzerland, Denmark, USA, Australia, and New Zealand.  Reform Acts of 1867 and 1883 ""quadrupled the electorate"" in Britain.  Belgium democratized in 1884.  Norway in 1898.  Finland, 1905. Sweden in 1908.  Signs of female suffrage in Wyoming in USA and in New Zealand and S. Austrialia.( 85-86)</p>
<p>* Growth of electoral systems based on broad electorate ""iimplied the organization of mass movements and mass parties, the politics of mass propaganda and the developing mass media..."" (87)  Thsi changed the nature of politics.  Politice were ""obliged to appeal to a mass electorate; even to speak directly to the masses or indirectly through the megaphone of the popular press..."" (88)  And H interprets: ""...as the men who governed wrapped themselves in rhetoric, the serious discussion of politics retreated to the world of the intellectuals and the educated minority public which read them."" (88)  Also the rise of politial sociology: Durkheim, Sorel, Ostrogorski, and the Webbs, Pareto, Rochert Michels, and Max Weber.</p>
<p>* New mass movements: ""rise of politico-confessional mass movements"".  This process hampered by resistance from the Catholic Church.  (90-91)  His analysis of these starts on 90 and goes to 95.  These groups unfiied by religion, but also national identification.  The extreme form of these movements was the ""party-cum-movement"", e.g. the German Social Democrats.  This was rare, but the phenomena of this were typical.  1) Conssited of a ""complex of local organizaiton or branches...integrated into a party with wider political objectives..."" (92)  2) They were ideological; not just interest groups.  They represented a ""total vision of the world.""  Thus H compares them to the ""civic-religion"" that Rousseau and Durkheim thought would ""bind togetehr modern societies: only in this instance it formed a sectional cement.  Religion, nationalism, demcoracy, socialism, the precurse ideolgoies of inter-war fascism: these held together the newly mobilized masses, wahterver material itnerest their movements also represented."" (93) 3)  They were ""global"".  ""They either shattered the old localized or regional fraemwork of politics, or pushed it to the margin, or integrated it into wider comprehensive movements.""  (94)  H points out that it was the ""party which made the notable, or which at least saved him from isolation and political impotence, rather than the other way around."" (94)  So the new politicsl ""did not substitute 'the people' for patronage and influence, but the organization: that is to say the committees the party notables, the activist minorities.""  (94)  This was often identified by contemporaries as ""oligarchy"", e.g Robert Michels saw this in the German Social demcoratic Party.  So these new mass movements were ""by no means republics of equals.""  They were organizations that combined organization and ""mass support"".  H says they ""were potential states."" (95)</p>
<p>* Mass movements posed problems for the preservation of unity and existence of states: problems of division, problems of maintaining policies (e.g. the challenge to the gold standard esp. in the US), and the problem of the ""legitimacy"" of society when faced with mass movements calling for social revolution.  (95-96)</p>
<p>* The problem of legitimacy particularly problematic in the face of parliamentary inefficiency, partisan division, and the ""undoubted corruption of political systems which no longer rested on men of indepdnent wealth, but increasingly on men whose careers and wealth were based on their success in the new politics."" (96)</p>
<p>* 1880s saw emergence of mass movements.  These movements eroded the ""mid-century political predominace of the liberal bourgeoisie"" (98) that had also been weakened by the Great Depression in the 1970s.  (98)  Example of the stress produced by mass movments: e.g. Bismarck's inability to deal effectively with the rise of Catholic mass movement or the Social Democrats.  (99) The bourgeoisie was worried but did not feel seriously threatened.  ""Civilized behavior, the rule of law, and liberal institutions were still expected to continue their secular progress."" (100)  H points out that the major scandals of the day were surrounding crsies that from our 20th century vantage point seem normal, even daily, occurences.  (100-101).  E.g. Dreyfus ""refusal to enquire into a singl miscarriage of justice"" or Zebern in 1913 ""twenty demosntrators locked up for a night by the German army in an Alsatian town"" (100).</p>
<p>* So the ""ruling classes"" looked for other strategies namely their sought to bring labour and socialist movmenets (that had emerged in the 1890s) into the state.  This was achieved first in Britain when the ""Labour Representation Committee"" entered parliament as the Labour Party in 1906.  (102)  Such ""overtures from the parliamentary centre to the extreme left"" also involved a ""readiness to venture into programmes of social reform and welfare"" (102): e.g. Dismark's social insurance program in 1880s as a way to undercut socialist agitation.  (103)</p>
<p>* The legitimacy of the state?  How would this be secured.  This H says was the era in which ""governments, intellectuals, and businessmen discovered the political signifiance of irrationality.""  (105)  He writes; ""Political life thus found itself increasingy ritualized and filled with symbols and publicity appeals, both overt and subliminal.  As the ancient ways -- mainly religious -- of ensuring subordination, obediance and loyalty were eroded, the now patent need for something to replace them was met by the <em>invention</em> of tradition, using both old and tried evokers of emotion such as crown and military glory and, as we have seen, new ones such as empire and colonial conquest."" (105).  See 105-107</p>"
"From Experts to Social Scientists: The American Anthropologists, 1929-1963","p.039-45  New Dominance for Synchronic approach to culture

Madden asserts 1) that ""[t]he historical bent of Boasian anthropology had
helped to hold together the four fields as a body of knowledge."" (39)  And then
also that there was gradually an increase in synchronic research that involved a liking of anthropology with other social sciences.  (39) 

One problem how to include physical anthropology in this.  From 40-45, Madden shows effort to use new toold of anthropological research  and understand the material artificat as somethign that could be understood psychologically, as a thing  connected to human behavior.  Paul Martin quote fro m1937: ""...Artifacts, then, are the results of ehaivor and attitudes directed toward material objects."" (quoted on 42).  

Julian Steward and Frank Setzler also though about this.  Archaeology could not just be about taxonmoy and classification.  Also needed to be about how these things fit into a general scheme.  

For Madden on 45, this all goes to show that cultual anthropologists (synchronic type) increasingly dominant. Archaeology needed to show how it fit into this.  (45)."

<p>* The American Revolution has often been seen not to be particularly radical.  Progressive historians attempted to interpret it as radical social movement similar to the French Revolution.  Those attempts failed, Wood thinks, because the ""social conditions that generically are supposed to lie behind all revolutions--poverty and economic deprivation--were not present in colonial America...the white American colonists were not an oppressed people; they had no crushing imperial chains to throw off.""

<p>* Because the impulses behind the revolution were unlike those driving modern revolutions, there has been a tendency therefore  that it was not <em>social</em>.  ""It has...been considered to be essentially an intellectual event, a constitutional defense of American rights against British encroachments ('no taxation without representation'), undertaken not to change the existing structure of society but to preserve it."" (4)  Quoting Bailyn's <em>The Ideological Origins, </em>Wood says the American revolutionary leaders were not concerned about ""recasting the social order"" or with the ""problems of inequality and the injustices of stratified societies but with the need to purify a corrupt constitution and fight off the apparent growth of prerogative power.'"" (4) In thise sense it has been dubbed by some to be ""hardly a revolution at all."" (4)</p>
<p>* But Wood insists that ""if we measure the the radicalism of the revolution by the amount of social change that actually took place--by transformations in the relationships that bound people to each other--then the American Revolution was not conservative at all; on the contrary: it was as radical and as revolutionary as any in history."" (5)</p>
<p>* It was radical and social he says, however, in a ""very special eighteenth-century sense."" (5)--meaning the reason it was so often couched in purely political language was because in the eighteenth century ""most people...could not as yet conceive of society apart from government. The social distinctions and economic deprivations that we today think of as the consequence of class divisons, business explotiation, or various isms-capitalism, racism, etc--were in the eighteenth century usually thought to be caused by the abuses of government.  Social honors, social distinctions, prerequisities of office, business contracts, privileges and monoopolies, even excessive property and wealth of various sorts--all social evils and social deprivations --in fact seemed to flow from connections to government, in the end from connections to monarchical authority.  So that when Anglo-American radicals talked in what seems to be only political terms--purifying a corrupt constitution, eliminating courtiers, fighting off crown power, and, most important, becomign republicans--they nevertheless had a decidedly social message."" (5)</p>
<p>* As a resultl of the revolution, Wood writes: ""One class did not overthrow another; the poor did not supplant the rich.  But social relationships--the way people were connected one to another--were changed, and decisively so."" (6)</p>
<p>* He insisits that the revolution 'destroyed aristocracy as it had been understood in the Western world for at least two millenia."" (8)  But it also did not just eliminate monarchy, it also changed what ""Americans meant by public or state power"" and created ""an entirely new kind of popular politicas and a new kind of demcoractic officeholder."" (8)  And he says most importantly, in a point he echoes on the last page of the book, that it made ""the interests and prosperity of ordinary people--their pursuits of happiness--the goal of of society and government.""

(110)  she's referring to the reform activities of the pre-1920 women's movement and the post 1920 women's movemnt that ""was dying, in part as a resutl of the forces in the professional world in which these two pscyhologists had been trained."" (110)  ""The values of indiviudalism, egalitarianism, scientific objectivity, and careerism that characterized the scholarly outlook in the emerging American university turned many women students away from the ideals of womanhood that had shaped their upbringing--ideals like selflessness, feminine purity, and social reform."" (110)  The failure of the ERA ammendment to genrate support from the League of Women Voters is she says an indiateion of this split.   And she notes ater that ""[a]fter 1920 it became increasingly difficult to reconcile reform with sicence, and the polarization that resulted among women persistde dfor two generations.""

What Pragmatism Means,"<p>General Notes</p>
<p>* James wants to speak of the ""pragmatic method"" which is ""primarily a method of settling metaphysical disputes that might otherwise be interminable."" (94)&nbsp; In question such as is the world ""one or many?--fated or free?"" etc... he says the pragmatic method will ask what are the ""practical consequences.""&nbsp; ""What difference would it practically make to anyone if this notion rather than that notion were true?"" (94)</p>
<p>* He references Charles Peirce 1878 article entitled ""How to Make Our Ideas Clear"" in <em>Popular Science Monthly</em> as the place where the philosophy was introduced and says that the idea as that ""our beliefs are really rules for action"" and that ""to develop a thought's meaning we need only dtermine what condut it is fitted to produce: that conduct is for us its sole significance."" (94)&nbsp; No ""thought-distinction"" he continues is ""so fine as to consist in anything ut a possible difference of pratice.""&nbsp; (95)&nbsp; So that to attain a clearness in our thoughts about an object we ""need only consider what conceiveable effects of a practical kind the object may involve--what sensations are we to expect from it, and what reactions we must prepare."" (95)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* He says that he bruoght the idea forward again in 1898 and made a special application of it to religiopn at ""an address before Professor Howison's philosophical union at the University of California..."" (95)</p>
<p>* The pragmatic method he says is an extension of the ""empiricist attitude"" he says ""but it represents it in a more radical and in a less objectionable form than it has ever yet assumed.""&nbsp; (97)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* He says that the pragmatist turns his back on things that ""professional philosophers"": ""away from abstraction and insufficiency, from verbal solutions, from bad <em>a priori</em> reasons, from fixed principles, closed system,s and preteneded absolutes and origins."" (97)&nbsp; He turns twoards ""concereteness and adequacy, toward facts, toward action, and towards power."" (97)&nbsp; James continues: ""It means th eopen air and possibilities of na ture, as against dogma, artificiality and the pretence of finality in truth."" (97)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* If it were to triumph he says then there would be an ""enormous change"" in the ""'temperament' of philospohy"" (97)&nbsp; ""Science and metaphysics would come much nearer together, would in facct work absolsutely hand in hand."" (97)</p>
<p>* Attacking metaphysics which he says has ""followed a very primitive kind of quest"" -- that is he notes following words as if they had a magical and transcendent power, ie imaginign that some word ""names the univers's principle..."" (97) -- he says that with the pragmatic method ""you cannot look on any such word as closing your quest.&nbsp; You must bring out of each word its practical cash-value, set it at work within the <strong>stream of your experience</strong>."" (98)&nbsp; So pragmatism ini relation to metaphysics means ""<em>The attitude of looking away from first things, principles, 'categories,' supposed necessitities; and looking towards last things, fruits, consequences, facts."" </em>(98)</p>
<p>* Now addressing science he notes that there has been an incredible confidence about the discoery of laws such that ""men were so carried away by the clearness, beauty and simplification that resulted, that they believed thesmselves to have deciphered authenttically the eternal thoughts of the Almighty."" (99)&nbsp; But now as things developed it appeared that the laws were only approximations and the laws have grown numerous.&nbsp; He mentions Mach and Pearson along with Sigwar, Milhaud, Poincare, duhem and Ruyysen after saying ""human arbitrariness has driven divine necessity from scientific logic."" (100)</p>
<p>* Then he says Schiller and Dewey have appeared with ""their pragmatistic accounts of what truth everywhere signiffies."" (100) And he describes their idea this way: ""Everywhere...'truth' in our ideas and beliefs means the same thing that it means in science.&nbsp; It means, they say, nothing but this, <em>that ideas (which them</em>selves <em>are but parts of our experience) become true just in so far as they help us to get into satisfactory relation with other parts of our experience, </em>to summarize them and get about among them by conceptual short-cuts instead of following the interminable succession of particular phenomena.&nbsp; Any idea upon which we cna rid, so to eapk, any idea that will carry us prosperously from any on part of our experience to any other part, linking things satisfactorily, working securlely, simplifying, saving labor...<em>"" </em>( 100)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* He describes a process of the formation of ""new opinions"" as the central process that Dewey and Schiller focused on.&nbsp; He describes that process on 100-101.&nbsp; The point is that a ""stock of old opinions"" is put under a new strain somehow because someone contradcits the ideas, or new desires emerge or new facts arise.&nbsp; Then the person ""seeks to escape by modifying his previous mass of opinions"" but there's a conservatism, in fact James saws ""we are all extreme conservatives."" (101, cf compare with his notion of plasticity in ""Habits.""&nbsp; Then a new idea comes up that can be ""grafted"" upon the old ideas so that the new idea ""mediates bewteen the stock and the new experience and runs them into one another most felicitously and expediently."" (101)&nbsp; This conservatism seems key as he says a bit later ""[t]he most violent revolutions in an individuals' beliefs leave most of his old order standing.&nbsp; Tieme and space, cause and effect, nature and history, and one's own biography remain untouched.&nbsp; New truth is awlays a go-between, a smoother-over of transitions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It marries old opioin to new fact so as ever to show a minimum of jold, a maximum of continuity."" (101)&nbsp; And he notes later that the power of old truths is key: Their influence is absolutely controlling.&nbsp; Loyalt to them is the first principel--in most case it is the only principle..."" (102)&nbsp; Because he notes it is usaally by loyalty to those patterns that one reacts to a situation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>*&nbsp; New truth is thus also additive.&nbsp; A new idea becomes ""true"" ""just in proportion as it gratifies the individual's desire to assimiilate the novel in his experience to his beliefs in stock."" (103)&nbsp; And in this sense it ""<strong>must both lean on old truth and grasp new fact</strong>..."" (103)&nbsp; Thus new turth grafts itself on to the ""ancient body of turth, which thus grtows much as a tree grows by the activity of a new layer of cambium."" (103)</p>
<p>*&nbsp; The truth that ""rationalistically minded thinkers"" refer to, are the old truths ""that we <em>find </em>merely; truth no longer malleable to human need; truth incorrigible, in a word...""&nbsp; And this is just the ""dead hear of the living tree, and its being there means onlyut hat truth also has its paleonology and its 'prescription'...(103)</p>
<p>* Rationalist critics [rationalism = ? empiricism or idealism, both?&nbsp; the one who relies on reason?] see this notion opinion and truth that focuses on how they ""work""&nbsp; as ""coarse, lamesecond-rate makeshift article of truth."" (104) &nbsp; He sees them as saying that objective truth must be ""something non-utilitarian, haughty, refined remote, august, exalted.&nbsp; It must be an absolute correspondce of our thoughts with an equally absolute reality.""&nbsp; It must be what we <em>ought </em>to think, unconditionally.""&nbsp; (105)&nbsp; But James would fire back that this type of mind is simply one that fails to realize facts and ""conceretenees.""--Indeed, the cast of mind of the rationalist is itself one of those concrete results perhaps...&nbsp; The rationalist cannot recognize the ""concretes from which his own abstraction is taken."" (105)&nbsp; Meanwhile, for the pragmatist ""Truth, for him, bcomes a class-name for all sorts of definite working-values in experience."" (105)</p>
<p>* But now a key argument: pragmatism ""may be a happy harmonizer of empiricist ways of thinking, with the more religious demands of human beings."" (105)</p>
<p>a ) Getting into this argument on 106, he gives a brief intellectual history of the divide bewteen empiricism and what he calls the ""present-day fashion of idealism..."" which he says those of the ""fact-loving temperament"" (ie tought-minded)... The old-fashioned theism was ""bad enough"" but w2hen Darwinisim ""once for all displaced design from the minds of the 'scientific,'"" then theism lost hold and ""some kind of an immanent or pantheistiic deity working <em>in </em>things rather than above them is, if any, the kind recommended to our contemporary imagination."" (106)&nbsp; [It may be Josiah Royce where this is coming from...]&nbsp;</p>
<p>b) James is concerned that this ""conception"" may not suplly ""religious comfort"" (107)&nbsp; But his main point is that ""no one can pretened that it doens't suffer fromt he faults of remoteness and abstractneess."" (107)&nbsp; It is noble but he thinks that ""[i]n this real world of sweat and dirt, it seems that when a view of things is 'noble,' that ought to count as a presumption against its truth..."" (107)&nbsp;</p>
<p>c) Yet the reason pragmatism can bring this idealism closer to empiricism is because although ""she"" is devoted ot the facts, he says, there is no ""materialistic bias as ordinary empiricism labors under."" (107)&nbsp; There is also no bias against ""abstractions"" he says ""aso long as you get about amopnmg particulars with their aid and they actually carry you somewhere."" (107)&nbsp; So there is also no <em>""a priori </em>prejudices"" agianst theology.&nbsp; (107)&nbsp; So the theological ideas will be thought ""true"" if ""theological ideas prove to have a value for concerete life..."" (107)&nbsp;</p>
<p>d) Giving an example, he adds, tounge-in-cheek, that the transcendental idealism that he just described performs a ""concerete function"" in that it provides a ""moral holiday""--because ""since in the Absolute finite evil is 'overruled' already, we may, therofre, wehnever we eish, treate the temporal as if it were potentially the eternal, be sure that we can trusth in its outcome, and, without sin, dismiss our fear and drop the worry of our finite responsibility.""

Alain L. Locke: The Biography of a Philosopher,"<p>p.011-15   Locke's early experience</p>
<p>The authors note that not much evidence exists.  IN a 1909 letter to his mother while in Oxford he remarked upon remembering that he had been walking along Fifth Street in Phillie as a child and had been asked to hold a horse's head--as though he were a stable boy.  Locke recalled this incident in Oxford in 1909 because he had taken up riding as a sport.  (10-11)</p>
<p>In a 1927 essay ""Hail Philadelphia,"" Locke recalled that he was aware of the portraits of black predecessors who were on the walls of ""the library"" [Which library??] (11)</p>
<p>The authors suggest that Locke early-on developed a sense of elitism nurtred by pride in his own family's history as freeborn blacks.  The authors quote this : ""Even when he couldn't recognize anything, each day he was taken out of the NEgro slumns into Rittenhouse Square in order that he might grow up a pure little gentlemen."" (quoted on 11).</p>
<p>Locke had faith that he understood human nature because o fhis ability to ""size people up"": ""Whenever I'm not quite sure that I can undersand human nature, I recall the like [his ability to evaluate people's skills] --and grow conceited again--which for al that it is my own eyes--but I soon get myself back on my pedetsal in my little niche and feel at home again."" (quotedd on 11).</p>
<p>The authors explain that this self-confidence is characteirstic as well as his refernece to his own elistism; the uathors write that he ""rather preempotrily joins his ancestors in the estheticized frame of an elevated niche."" (11)</p>
<p>Locke's own self-reflection and awarness of his own past corroborates the author's claim.  In a 1942 account written for Harvard Alum reports he describes himsself as being born to ""native Philadephias and schoolteachers; and thus into smug gentility."" (quoted on 12)  He says that a ""professional career was mandator, allt he more so because of the frantic respectability of the free, edcuated Negro tradition, their bulwark agianst proscription and prejudice."" (quoted on 12)</p>
<p>The authors' suggest the content of this ""frantic respectability"" in an incident in which Locke's mother was described as ressed too smartly for some social function by a newspaper.  Locke was outraged at the afront to his mothers' respectability and wrote letters to the newspaper, saying he meant to ""head off his [the authors'] nigger tendency of talking back in his columns..."" (quoted on 12)</p>
<p>A fascination section drawn from some notes that Locke had made for a proposed autiobiography, reveal the character of his upbrining and in particularly his relationship with his mother.  It appeared to me to be a kind of picture of the late nineteenth-century ideal of how to raise a male child in which the mother indulges and poors affection on the child as a form of discipline.  See p.13-15.</p>"

The Rise of Neo-kantianism: German Academic Philosophy between Idealism and Positivism,"<p># Klaus Christian Köhnke, *The Rise of Neo-Kantianism: German Academic Philosophy between Idealism and Positivism*, trans. R.J. Hollingdale (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991)<br /><br />## Introduction<br /><br />* Book is simply an attempt to pursue the historical question of ""how neo-Kantianism emerged and whatled or contributed to its dissemination."" (1)<br /><br />* Existing appraisals of neo-Kantianism have been unsatisfactory and polemical. He describes the reaction on 3-4 bz Karl Löwith in his *Von Hegel Zu Nietzsche*, by George Lukacs, Karl Korsch, and Ernst Bloch. All have been dismissive fo neo-Kantianism. Löwith treated it as a ""symptom of decline"" in the bourgeois class, marked by an ""unmotivated"" return to Kant. (3) But Köhnke accuses Löwith's own account of being unhistorical because it was a search for useful philsophical traditions oreinted to 20th century needs. Another more political line of critique came from Bloch who accsused neo-Kantianism of reinterpreting Kant in a way that prepared the way for liberal nationalism in Germany. Here it is worth quoting Bloch: ""And a school which totally dominated all the GErman universities distorted Kant, not yet into a proto-fascist, but ot such an extent into a National Liberal that the philosopher of the German Enlightenment looked like a Bismarckian drawing-room philistine. This particular falsification is called neo-Kantianism..."" (quoted on 3). The DDR's&nbsp; *Philosophisches Wörterbuch* similarly describes neo-Kantianism as arising out of the close association between ""fuedal reaction"" and the bourgeoisie... <br /><br />* In general, Köhnke notes that there is a tendences to discredit neo-Kantianism ""by pointing ceaselessly to what they regard as the disastrous political evolution of Germany"" and so to consider neo-Kantianism in relation to political and economic history, but to do so superficially. (4) He says their accounts just don't hold water. Fro example, how do they account for neo-Kantian socialists like FA Lange? All of these accounts moreover have consistently pointed to a neo-Kantian scool, but noone has ever traced it. (4-5) <br /><br />* He continues to go through all the gaps he sees on 5 and 6.<br /><br />* Structure of book: Pt. 1 looks at the ""prehistory"" of neo-Kantianism ""within the framework of variously motivated renunctiation of German idealism ont he part of academic philosophy and the reassessment of Kant that arose from it."" (6) Pt. 2 gets into what he says is an already specified neo-Kantian ""programmata"", from 1860s to 1865 that arose from ""various attempts at a theoretical re-establishment of philosophy and assertion of its autonomy or from drafts and outlines of sythenesse designed to unite old idealism with new materialism or with the new thinking of the natural sciences... (6) Pt. 3 focsues on the ""actual dissemination"" of neo-Kantianism. Here there is a degreeof unity, but also the basis for ""a dividing up into schools."" (6) <br /><br />* These three phrases he says describe a process of transition from German idealism to a ""golden age of neo-Kantianism"". (7) <br /><br />* He also notes that neo-Kantianism was ""first an almost exclusively academic movement"" and so its development ""was in many ways dependent on that of the university in general and belongs to the historz of science to culturla history, ubut within the specific period 1830 to 1881 it was also frequentlzy dependednt on the history of chruch and state."" (7) <br /><br />## Part 1 The abandonment of German idealism (1830-1848)<br /><br />### 1. Friedrich Adolf Trendelenburg as mediator between idaelism and neo-Kantianism<br /><br />*&nbsp; This chapter focuses on Trendenlenburg, a pupil of Karl Leonard Reinhold, who was the man who did a great dealto disseminate Kantian philosophy in Germany. He was born in 1802 in Eutin. He was taught Kantian philosophy in Gymnasium. Köhnke sees him as a key figure in neo-Kantianism's prehistory.&nbsp; (11)<br /><br />*&nbsp; Trendenlenburg encounters the thought of von Berger who in his ""Principle of Knowledge"" interpreted philosophy as a science whose goal was to become the ""common bond of all the individual sciences."" (quoted on 12) Waht von Berger had decided was thtat philosphies' main goal was that of determining the ""questions pertaining to the foundations of the sciences."" (12)&nbsp; This was a break from the main tendency of the age to see philosophy as the ""science of principles"" -- a pattern that was supported by Fichte's *Wissenschaftslehre* and Schelling's experiments in ntural philosophy. But von Berger had decided that philosohpy was not be derived from principle that ""prescribed"" the principles of each individual science, but rather ""a philosophical analysis and understanding of the principles of th esceicnes that actually exist."" (12) That approach -- in addition to being a rejection of sorts of idealism -- was also a modification of Kantian ideas ""for a normative understanding of science was replaced by a the unconditional recognition of the individual disicplines that had in fact historically evolved: science was understood as the acts performed by different individual scientists, and legitimation of these acts was much more likely to derive from the facts of the science itself and from its traditions than from philosophical principles."" (12-13) <br /><br />&gt; Note: This new emphasis on the *actuality* of a science is interesting. In Guyer's examination of neo-Kantian aesthetics there is a similar shift toward an assesment of aesthetic experience based on the actual existing expereince of art... see his ""What happened to Kant in Neo-Kantian Aesthetics?..."" <br /><br />* Köhnke says that at first von Berger had attempted to adhere to an idealistic ocnception of ""a fundamental discipline that provided the basis and explanation of everything..."" (13) But ultimately he began to develop what Köhnke describes as an ""organic conception of the world"". It was he says the idea of **motion** that emerged as a way to ""mediate between the multiplicity of individual areas of knowledge and that 'philosophy derived from a principle'' (13)&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />* He describes this notion of the ""organic conception of the world"" -- although it is not clear where this phrases comes from --- as having a ""contemplative religious temper"" and a focus on ""the multiplicity of things"" and it gradually puhsed the idealist doctrine of the princciple of things to the background. (13): ""for what now ensues is an ascent, progressing gradually and through a hierarchy of human capacities, from the physical forces of the sphere of life up to the realm of the intelligence and finally to that of faith: attempts to establish the foundations of the moral world have now been replaced by a description of the actual world."" (13) So in von Berger and then in Trendenlenburg the goal is ""to perceive the connection between becoming in nature and ideal becoming, to unite in though the first beginning of things with the highest aim and goal of the spirit-world."" (13)<br /><br />* Köhnke futher explains what he means by saying that natural and ideal then become ""two variants of constructive purposive motion"" that mediate theoretical and practical reason ""in an act of intllectual contemplation."" (13) He says that in so doing take into account a ""certain experience of God"" that was characteristic of objective idealism as described by Dilthey (where?) in a phrase ""the Timeles that lies behind the whole evolution"" . (13) But von Berger and Trendelenburg are not like Fichte, Reinhold, SChelling, and Hegel feeling that it is necessary to ""found through the idea of identiical subject-object a claim to a complete theoretical comphrension of totality: they are satisfied, rather, with posessing in the concept of motion a univerally applicable *descriptive* formula for reality."" (13) <br /><br />* This re-orientation toward the empirical and away from the construction of totalizing systemic views occurs on von Berger as a kind of miscarriage of his attempts to see philosophy as establishing unity. Köhnke describes this miscarraige on 14-15. <br /><br />* Köhnke seems to see this miscarriage as typical of the outcome of Romantic thought. Romantic attempts to construct systems seem to always rely on irrational appeals to foundational principles. That tended in turn to create miscarraige's like von Berger's which he describes as ""a valid guide as to which problems were capable of breaking up the abstract formalisms of the early Romantic philosophical&nbsp; systems..."" (15) He describes a reaction against absolute idealism that was more widespread. There is a quote on 16 by Henrik STeffans -- whom Trendelenburg had heard speak in Berlin -- that talks about a new orientation in Romatnic thought that was less rooted in totalizing deductions of a unified system based on fundamental principle, and more on a teleological examination of the organic world. That was the approach of Schelling that challenged Fichte. The quote by Steffans thus talkks about an approach that seeks an ""intuitive knowledge of all existence as an organic whole"" , of ""organic evolution"", so a new kind of teleology... Köhnke calls it a ntural-philsophical teleology. (17) He says there emerged alongside the idealist deductive-aprioric type of sysstem of Reinhold and Fichte, and the methodistic-encyclopaedic system of Hegel a third Romantic-Weltanchaulich that challenged ""the concept of system as such and its claim to coprehend totality"" and instead turned to the search for teleology in actual facts. <br /><br />* Köhnke says importantly for his narrative and overall argument that in this way that the irrationalism of Roamtnicism helped produce ""the ninteenth century's love of facts"" (17), i.e. he does not think that Romanticism only produces more irrationalism and ultimately violent nationalism. This is key to his argument in which he will give a bit more respect to neo-kantian philosophy than others who have seen it just as the beginning of the German decline into radical nationalism.&nbsp; He even goes so far as to argue -- and I think this is too much -- that ""This non-system, or abandonment of system, of von Berger and Trendelenburg is the Romantic system.&nbsp; It is the system of emphasiyin the scientific value of individual phenomena as opposed to any kind of estblishment of principles--it is the system of positivist natural-scientific, historical, philological nd philosophical historical knowledge. It pronounces that systematic construction must be replaced by the collection of individual facts, by 'immersion' and by engagement with the multiplicity of things."" (17) I think this certainly is **one** of the outcomes of Romatnicism, but it is not **the** system... (17) <br /><br />* Important though is that this focus still wants to trace the link between philosphophy and empricil sceince to a divine source. There is still an interest in unity.&nbsp; Köhnke quotes Bratuscheck on Trendelenburg: ""In that the spirit aims more and more at the ideal, the unity of the ideal, the divine, constitutes the focus of its endeavour; the innermost core of all morality is religion, and the philosophy of religion is thus the flower of practical philosophy. If, consequently, science is always theoretically engaged in contemplation of undending nature, either directly or through self-awareness or as a practical task, and if, again, all knowledge proceeds in a practical sense out of the highest gaols of life, then an intrinsic connection must exist between all sciences; thus the philosophy which is to estblish this connection is not a mere propadeutic for th eindivididual branches of science, it must permeate them in all their parts.... "" (18-19)<br /><br />*&nbsp; So there is a turn away from the idealist claim through a ""self-engendered ego"" to constitute the foundation of a ""system structure."" There is a continued religious focus that remains interested in unity, but also there is a ""heightened interest in multipliticy of reality and the inductive investigation&nbsp; of it."" (19) IN thi way Köhnke says Trendleenburg nd von Berger represent a kind of shift in Romantic thought that was still interested in the spirit but tht had also ""made its peace with the existing world."" (20)&nbsp; There is an attention to all the complexity of the world and there is a desire to apprehend a unity... <br /><br />* In the next section of this chapter, Köhnke describes how Trendenlenburg formed a notion of the theory of science that was somehow an alternative and a precursor to positivist science in his *Logiche Untersuchungen*. In this work he lays out a goal to ""learn from the sciences rather than seek to instruct them."" (21) He seeks to recognize the individual and autonomous method of each of the scences and then trace backj from them to a ""single mode of thought"" or the logic that produces these individual sceicnes. (20-22) &nbsp;<br /><br />* Köhnke thinks that this theory of science has been misunderstood. In specifying what it is he emphasizes that it was an attempt to try to ""reconcile the fundamentals of the philosohpy of identity with teh fact of the growiong multiplicity of merely positive knowledge."" (22) The problem was tht each of the sciences ""presupposes an identity of being and thought."" (22)&nbsp; So then how do you reconcile a philosphical interest in unity -- let alone a philosphy that presumes to reduce reality to principle -- with that multiplicity.? In the theory of science that Trendelenburg tried to shape a new synthesis based on attention to knowledge and interest, reduction to principle, attention to multiplicity, and the ""organic conception of thw orld"" ... (22) <br /><br />* Köhnke says that Trendelenburg envisioned a multi-level process of inetegration. EAch discipline develops its own theory of knoweldge by ""incorporating the problem of perception and the concepts of psychology. The theory of science relates the facts of autonomous individual sciences to logic. And in high philosophy a ""new evaluation of the empiricaal ovecomes the previous constructionism of speculative thinking and rises to the exmaiton of the material elements&nbsp; of scientific inquiry."" (23) <br /><br />* Trendenlenburg's ideas were influentijal in Germany. Köhnke says that his ideas dominated Berlin Univerity for an entire generation. and that he was able to influence the Prussian educaitonal system. (25) His theory of science when applied to school had the aim of preparing for the study of individual sciences and aslo his texts served as introdcutions into science in generl. (26) <br /><br />* Thus Köhnke says that theory of science beceame relevant precisely ""where philosohpy's older requirement for unity encountered the new requirement for specialization and accumulation of knolwedge: as an attempt at mediation between multiplicity and unity -- in terms of the history of philosphy between idealist philosophy of mind and empirical science -- it revised the philosophical apriories of the age of systems."" (26)<br /><br />* HIs theory of science also emerged out of another product of the greater accumulation of knowledge within this system, namely the grwoth of psychology as a distinct disicpline and its separation from logic. This had also played a role in the ""miscarriage"" of von Berger's attempt to develop a philosophy of unity and pure thought. Antrhopolgoical and psychological questions got in the way. That faith in pure thought was assailed by the problem of knowledge, ie it's disunity, and then also by ""the effect of anthropology and psyschology had of rendering problematijc the originally self-assured ego. Deductions and constructions were not repalced by the more modest claims of psychological or logical inquiry. 'Pure thought' lost its reliability as philosophy's leading principle and method to just the extent that theindividual sciences began to find quesitonsal its characteryation as a 'human faculty'. It was above all anthropology and psychology which contested the meaning and truth-content of this claim, wahile it was at the same time precisely these sciences that offered new empirical knowledge assisting towards a better understanding of the nature of the psyche and the ego..."" (27) <br /><br />Great quote here I think from von Berger:<br /><br />&gt; For the history of philosophical systems teaches us that it is only too easy for the human spirit...to lose its spiritual equilibrium, as the repeated experience of error has instructed it in the impactiece of its striving and guarded it against new perils. Thus here it strays into a thoughtless empiricism which, itself capable of thought, would nonetheless like to eventuate in thoughts and conepts, there into an arrogant transcendentalism and the preciptate construction of metaphysical hoses of cards that the slightest breath of air can blow down."" (quoted on 28) <br /><br />* So for von Bergeer there needed to be a transformation of logic into a theory of kowledge predicated on a scientific method in psyschology and athropology. But the result of this was most concerelty the undoing of the notion of deductions from ego: ""The autonomoy of deducation from the ego became untenable and, whereas it had formerlz created this foudnation alone and by its own power, philosophy's new ancillary sciences now compelled it to aprtake of knowledge acquired inductively. It opened itself to the empricial and seized old on things...""&nbsp; (28)<br /><br />* Trendelenburg and his theory of science is notable becuase it made the smae move for philosophy but at the same time ""adhered to the idea nd concept of the unity of knowledge and of the actually existing sciences..."" (28) Trendenlenbrurg was the first to point in this direction with his thoery of science. <br /><br />Great quote: <br />&gt; As theory of science it has...to serve as a signpost...for the sciences ... Although philosophy may have originated in unit with the other sciences...this union has long since been dissolved through division of labour, and philosophy now encounters the individual sciences dispersed and in the shape they have given themselves. It is these individual sciences that furnish the logic and metaphysics with their subject matter; logic and metaphysics find methods and presupposed principles present in the individual sciences, and their task is to discover their origin and unity."" (28) <br /><br />### 2. The rise of an autonomous discipline called *Erkenntnisstheorie*<br /><br />* This chapter traces a different line -- the rise of a ""modern theory of knowledge or epistemology"" . (36)&nbsp; Whereas Trendelenburg was the ""architecht"" of a ""neo-Kantian understanding of philosophy and theory of science..."" (36) The origins of this line of thought Koehnke says was Schleirermacher ""whose lectures on dialectics, delivered from 1811 and published in 1839, represent the first post-Kantian attempt at a theory of knowledge foudned on both pure thought and sense-perception."" (36) Koehnke notes taht th eonly historian of philosophy to see this before was Fierdrich Wueberweg, a pupil of Firiedrich Eduward Beneke and Trendelenburg. (36). <br /><br />* Thue chapter has three sections. <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;1. The first discusses the origins of the Erkenntnistheorie as an autonomous discpiline, something that was forming alreadying in the 1820s. For Koehnke to say this is a bit of a revision of the self-understanding of neo-Kantians, which claimed that this kind of approach&nbsp; emerged only in the 1870s. He quotes something (there are evidently no footnotes in this book!!!) that illustrates this attitude, and it's itneresting in terms of displaying a kind of self-understanding of neo-Kantianism:<br />&gt; German idealism had become bankrupt, Hegel's system had fallen to pieces, an age of anarchy, materialism, and universal philosophical decline had preceded the rise of neo-Kantianism, to which we owe the re-introduction into philosophy of the sort of epistemological inquiry which Kant began... (quoted on 37) <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of getting at the content of this autonomous discipline, Koehnke has a good quote on 42: ""The discipline of *Erkenntnistheorie*, the real objective of which was to be the investigation of the limits and truth-value, the forms and possibilities of knowledge, was, with regard to the formation of this philosophical concept in 1928, described by Ernst Reinhold with sufficient completeness for its futher dissemination and its establishment as a philsoohpical term to proceed sucessfully from this date."" (42) <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So Reinhold in other words established the oncept of this autonomous discipline three decades before Eduwar Zeller and others ""were to make the tem into the sign-manual of neo-Kantian philosophizing in the broadest sense becase inquiry into the limits and possibilities of knowledge had become a matter of wide concern an dinterest even in the era of post-idealist polemics, and above all to those directed against Hegelianism."" (42) <br /><br />&nbsp;2. The second section deals with the key thinker here Friedrich Eduward Beneke, who was one of the earliest and most severe critics of German idealism and someone who also urged a ""reconsideration of Kant."" (37) I found the account of Beneke's ideas really interesting, as well as Beneke's thought itself. He rejects the idea of philosophizing from principle and polemicizes against a theory of a priori judgements; thus he critiques Kant on this account. (44) He makes this clever argument that the reason that there is recourse to prinviple in philosophical systems is that ""we regard the genesis of an absolutely universal judgement by way of experience as incomprehensible."" (quoted on 45) He then urges a rjection of **this** a priori assumption, and the result he thinks is a analysis that can examine ""the relationship between logical forms and perceptions."" (Koehnke, 45).<br />&gt; The whole inquiry is from the standpoint of the purely human consciosness in fact so simle that we can discover scarcely a point to which specualation could attach its doubts and scruples. To the unspeculative mind (and fundamentally to the speculative too), being and perception are always so closely united it is incapable of thinking of one without the other. (Beneke quoted 45)<br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Koehnke has a great quote from a handbook of history that says ""The birth of this sensualist in a German city...is plainly a mistake... "" (45) And Beneke had trouble in his career because his ideas ran against the idealist strain. Hegel himself attempted to prevent Beneke from finding a position. (45-46). Koehnke has&nbsp; a quote on 46 from Johgannes Schulze that explains how Beneke's lectures be suspended because of the ""dreadful error"" in his thought that ""there are no universally valid truths"", a point of view that Schulzes thought ""no longer possible."" (46) <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; VV Kant Beneke had an ambivalent relationship. He liked the part of Kant that had made a sharp critique of metaphysics and when he made ""experience the condition of any kind of scientific knowledge. (50) But he disliked the idealism that had developed out of Kant's apriorism, which Koehnke says he viewed as a ""faulty evolution of German philosphy from Reinhold to Hegel..."" (50) Beneke, moreover, had a critique of this development that lamented what he saw as the isolation of German philosophy from the rest of the continent, see 47-48, 50-51. The following quote is useful:<br />&gt; Since as early as Bacon this has -- with many interruption and retrogressions but irresistibly nonetheless -- striven for two sublime goals. Firstly that of the supersession, not of metaphysics certainly, but of the methods of metaphysics...the striving for exclusive principles which cannot be other than they are (i.e. accoridng to the decrees of the founders of systems) is to e whoolly abandoned and instead on is to lay down what really is... Kant's philosophy was fundamentally a vigorous start inthis direction which miscarried only becasue the old method was still too powerful in Germany for even so sublime and independent a spirit as Kant to be able to free himself from it entirely. But we have grown half-a-century older since then; we have beheld the monster of specuation rise up before us in the most repulsive forms; and thus it cannot be long before Kantianism in all its purity triumps over the methods of metaphysics. (quoted on 51, from his book on Kant of 1832.) <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beneke's ideas though marginalized did ahve some influence in pedagogy, through the writing of Johann Gottlieb Dressler. Here, though, via Dressler these ideas were suspected of ""materalism"" by Ernst Adolf Eduard Caalinich (see bottom 53-54). But very interestingly!! Koehnke notes that it was through the critique of Beneke that the dsitinction between *Geistes-* and *Naturwissenschaften* was made for the first time by Calinich in the midst of a critique of Beneke and Dressler also:<br />&gt; The word philosophy is employed in a double sense. Sometimes it is understood to mean the sciences which, unlike the natural or mathematical sceinces, apply not to something sensual or perceivable by the senses but to the inner self of man, to the world of the spirit. When the word philosophy is employed in this sense it embraces familiar sciences such as psychology, logic, aesthetics, ethics, jurisprudence and theology. These sciences aer also called philosophical sciences. In contrast to the *Naturwissenschaften* they could also be called the *Geisteswissenschaften*. (Calinich quoted on 54) &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I.e. here Calinich is trying to bracket off these sciences into an idealistic realm, as a way of resisting the attempt of Beneke to base these in a theory of epistemology based on an awareness of sense (and of being). <br /><br />&nbsp;3. The third section deals with ""speculative theism."" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In setting up this section K&amp;ouml;hnke makes an important narrative claim I think. He notes following Max Wundt in 1932 that the transition from what Wundt calls the ""age of specualtive systems to that of the individual sciences, from Romanticism to positivism"" is hard to place. There is an account of Neo-Romanticism and a philosophy of life betwee Kant and 1830 that Dilthey helped start. (56). There is also a focus from the 1920s on a post-Hegelian philosophy. (56) And there are accounts of a ""third movement"" of phenomenology stemming from Feuerbach and the young Marx and of an existential strain coming out of Kierkeegard and with Nietzsche as a key figure. Karl L&amp;ouml;with's history tries to locate the ""true ninteenth century"" in this third movement. (56) From his point of view, however, there is another series of tendencies that he is tracing: namely, ""pscyhologism, the transformation of logic into theory of knowledge and theory of science, the intensive analysis of the hsitory of philosophy, and an increased admissino into philosophy of knowledge derived from the ntural and human sciences -- all of them tendenceis already recognizable in the philosophy of the pre-March period which were then to come to full fruition between teh 1850s and the 1870s..."" (56) These tendencies, importantly, he argues were what ""'provoked' the various responses that came on the one hand from the classics Kierkegaard, Marx and Nietzsche, and on the other from the movements within academic philosophy: the one by making a break with tradition, the other by assuming the ungrateful task of undertaking a reformatory adaption of philosophy to the continual influx of new scholarly and extra-scholarly tasks."" (56)&nbsp; --- Note: there is a lot in these arguments: 1) It reveals the stakes K&amp;ouml;hnke has in this study: he's trying to locate a key tradition -- a positivist one of sorts -- in the philosophical tradition of the nineteenth century, one that has gone undetected, but was not only the thing that this ""third movement"" of phenomenology and existential philosophy was responding to, but was also the basis of what will ultiamtely be neo-Kantianism, and tahtleads to 2) this seems to be his subtle characteriztino of neo-Kantianism yet, that it was an acaemic philospohical reaction to these tendencies that sought to adapt philosophy ""to the continual influx of new scholarly and extra-scholarly tasks."" (56) It's not entirerly clear to me what he means here, but I think most concretely he's referring to the emergence of this new individual sciences that fragmented the systems... to professionalization then?? Additionaly though, he argues that the latter reaction in academic philosophy is harder to recognize because it ""never appeared in a pure form."" (56-57) This is why he thinks von Berger and Trendelenburg have not been noticed as the root of a theory of science and Schileirmacher's *Dialektik* has not been noticed as the origin of a modern theory of knowledge (Erkenntnistheorie). (57) <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm skipping looking closer at this specualtive theism tradition 'cause I want to push further into his later argument...&nbsp; time time time. <br /><br /></p>"

"From ""Habit"" in the Principles of Pscyhology (1890)","<p>General Notes</p>
<p>* First he tries to define what habits are and says that to do so immediately leads one to consider the ""fundamental properties of matter."" (60)&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) The laws of nature he says are ""nothign but the immutable habits which the different elementary sorts of matter follow in their actions and reactions upon each other."" (60)</p>
<p>b) But in the ""organic world"" habits are more variable.&nbsp; Why is this?&nbsp; Because the organic world does not consist of elementary particles but compounds of elementary particles.&nbsp;&nbsp; The habits of a compound can change ""because they are in the last instance due to the structure of the compound, and either outward forces or inward tensions can, from one hour to another, turn the structure into something different from what it was."" (60)</p>
<p>--&gt;&nbsp; Plasticity: If an object changes too quickly it might disintegrate.&nbsp; Thus compounds have an inherent resistance to change that allows them to main integrity.&nbsp; He gives the example of how a bar of iron becomes magnetic or how india-rubber bcomes friable or plaster sets.&nbsp; That's plasticity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>...</em>the material in question opposes a certain resitsance to the modfiying cause, which it takes time to overcome,but the gradual yielding whereof often save the amterial from being disintegrated altogether.&nbsp; When the structure has yielded the same inertia becomes a condtion of its comparative permanence in the new form, and of the new habits the body then manifests. <em>Plasticity</em>, then, in the wide sense of the word, means the possession of a structure weak enought to yeild to an influence, but strong enough not to yield all at once. (61)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And organic matter and, he says, ""especially nervous tissue,"" has incredible plsaticity.&nbsp; So he lays out a principle that ""<em>the phenomena of habit in living beings are due to the plasticity of the organic material of which their bodies are composed..."" </em>(61)</p>
<p>* ""Brain-matter"" is a special case because it has been cutoff from mechanical and thermal changes.&nbsp; ""The only impressions that can be made upon them [minds] are through the blood, on the one hand, and through the sensory nerve-roots, on the other..."" (61)&nbsp; He now depicts a kind of flooding in and flooding out of impressions through a network of channels and suggests that habits are just discharges in this system.&nbsp; So a habit is a ""reflexive discharge""--or a ""concatenated discharge"" if complex--and its ""anatomical substrarum must be a path in this system [of channels.]"" (62)&nbsp; So ""the entire nervous system is nothing but a system f paths between a senseory <em>terminus a quo</em> and a muscular, glandular, or other <em>terminus ad quem."" (62)&nbsp; </em>And he images that habit formation is thus on this level the carving out of sensory paths over time, much like ""either solid or liquids pass over a pth..."" (62)&nbsp; So certain sensory paths are gradually ""scooped out and made more permeable than before..."" (62)</p>
<p>* Once formed he then wants to say these ""habits"" are immensely conservative and powerful.&nbsp; He gives examples of riderless cavalry horses going through their motions at the sounds of a bugle and a few others that wer less convinging.&nbsp; (63)&nbsp; Habit he says is the ""enormous fly/wheel of society, its most previous coservative agent."" (63)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* This conservative quality is obth good and bad because it is what gives order to society (see examples on bottom of 63), but ti also ""dooms us to fight out the battle of life upon the lines of our nurture or our early choice, and to make the best of a pursuit that disagrees, because there is no other for which we are fitted, and it is too late to begin again."" (63)</p>
<p>* Now he uses this to discuss character.&nbsp; He mentions the formation of professional mannerisms (64, top). He quotes Mill interestingly, saying ""A 'character,' as J.s. Mill says, 'is a comppletely fashioned will.'..."" (66) This point he develops further between 66-68, sounding very victorian.&nbsp; What he wants to say and what he says best on 64-65 is that we must build ascetic habits, habits of what on 67-68 he calls ""concentrated attention, energetic volition, and self-denial in unnecessary things."" (68)&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus he says that the ""psychological study of mental conditions is thus the most powerful ally of horatory ethics."" (68)</p>"
"In Pursuit of Equity: Women, Men, and the Quest for Economic Citizenship in 20th-Century America","<p>p.010 Economic Citizenship</p>
<p>K-H intervenes in the discussion of citizenship by T.H. Marshall defines thee kinds of citizenship: civil, political, and social (in his <em>Citizenship and Social Class and Other Essays</em>).  Marshall subsumes economic rights in the civil category since he sees the right to work as the most basic civil right (something won in the nineteenth century against customs, guilds, and apprenticeship systems).  By the nineteenth-century this ""principle of individual economic freedom"" had become essential according to Marshall in the Anglo-American world because required my market economy.</p>
<p>BUT K-H thinks economic rights shoudl not be subsumed into the category of civil citizenship because it ""obscures their interactive influence on political and social citizenship."" (10).</p>
<p>She also notes that economic rights such as the right to work are different than classical rights such as political rights because theywere ""negative.""  The right to work is a ""positive"" right in this sense, and she quotes Walter Korpi in describing such rights as ""proto-rights"" not usually enforced by the state; they are instead ""'norm-based' and socially reinforced."" (10)</p>
<p>With this in mind, K-H points out that the right to work <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">was not </span>enforced for women.  Indeed, American courts ""applied the notion as if women's liberties fell into a different category than those of men."" (11)  E.g. iun a 1915 decision it described the right to work as the ""very essence of the personal freedom and opportunity that it was the uprpose of the Fourteenth Amendment to secure.""  But then nonetheless it also restricted womens' access to that right.  She quotes Senator Robert Wagner: ""The right to work is synonymous with the inalienable right  to live....It has never been surrendered and cannot be forfeited.' Yet with respect to women, the idea that such restrictions were 'an offence against the liberty of the subject' dueled with the widespread belief that the liberty of women could and should be curtailed if it mjenaced the halth of the family.While rights to work for men could be counted among the fundamental sources of citizenship under liberal theory--a deeply rooted gendered prerogative--the ntoion that a public interest inhered in restricting women's work-related rights persisted in custom and law well into the 1960s."" (11)</p>
<p>The exclusion of women from the right to economic citizenship limited womens' access to economic life.  That in turn, K-H says Patement has argued assigned women to a secondary citienzhip status given the ""paramount duty of the citizen to work."" (12)  She notes that this idea has been reinforced by a wide range of theorists (see 12).  She quotes Sam Gompers as well as Owen Young, the chqirman of the board of General Electric, who said: ""Here in America we have raised the standard of political equality.  Shall we be able to add to that full equality in economic opportunity?  No man is wholly free until he is both politically and economically free; o man with an inadequate wage is free."" (quoteded on 12).</p>
<p>So did this apply to women K-H asks?  She notes taht when she speaks of economic citizenship she means it in a large sense (since some use it to discuss the workers' ability to control their work situations): ""I use it more broadly to suggest the achievment of an independent and relatively autonomous status that marks self-respect and provides access to the full play of power and influence that defines participation in a democratic society.  The concept of economic citizenship demarcates women's efforts to participate in public life and to achieve respect as woemn (soemtimes as mothers and family members) from the efforts of men and women to occupty equitable relationships to corporate and government services.  Access to economic citizenship begins with self-support, generally through the ability to work at the occupation of one's choice, and it does not end there.  Rather, it requires customary and legal acknwoledgment of personhood, with all that implies for expectations, training, access to and distribution of resources, and opportunity in the marketplace."" (13)</p>
<p>K-H notes that on a theoretical level that ""revaluing family roles"" and making them less dependent on female labor ""could provide the respect and the resources necessary to define a person as a competent actor in the public arena.  Ideally, espousing economic citizenship should not diminish caregiving as an equally enabling access route to democratic participation."" (13)  She notes that in practice there have been moments when ""the collective efforts of women have developed an ideology of caring into a succssful politics that enhanced community life and ameliorated disadvantaged working and living conditions."" (13) She's thinking she said of Addams and the social femiminists and also Ellen Key.  But then she notes that few ""individual women"" have been able to achieve ""public power for their caring roles, and while proclamations of the value of motherhood and family commitments have extended socail rights they have done little to provide the ground on which economic citizenship has been realized.""

Getting Spliced: Modernism and Sexual Difference,"p.116-118 Burke's Conclusions


--  She thinks that Stein, Moore, and Loy's ""poetics of collage is flexible enough to express homosexual, heterosexual, and asexual modes of the links between sexuality and writing."" (115)

-- Pound, by contrast, is phallogocentric-- consistent with the broader tradition of western ""phallogocentrism"" identified by Lacan, Derrida, and Luce Irrigarray (115-116).
-- She thinks that ""the female modernists were involved in a revisionary project that critiques the (perhaps unconsciously) phallagocentric principles implicit in male modernism."" (116) 

-- She thinks also that contemporary poetry--which Perloff described  in this way: ""...'the Romantic and Modernist cult of personality has given way to what the new poets call 'the dispersal of the speaking subject,' the denial of the unitary, authoratative ego.'"" (116)--has its roots in ""Stein's radical decentering of authorial perspective (as in, say, <i>Tender Buttons</i>) as much as or more than on Poundian logopoeia."" (116)
 
-- Finally, Burke quotes Margaret Homans to express the ""assumptions shared by many feminist literary critics"" about these women modernists: ""Poets' themes have implications for formal and rhetorical problems, and, conversely poets use rhetoric to model solutions to those social or cultural issues that their poems may be said to be 'about'...The cultural construction of gender is at once a formal and a thematic issue.  It shapes both the forms and the rhetorical modes poets have available to them and the wider social and cultural milieu that provdes their subject matter.'"" (quoted don 117, from Homan's article ""'Syllablees of Velvet': Dickinson, Rossetti and the Rhetorics of Sexuality,"" in Feminist Studies 11:3 (1985)).

Burke argues thought that the process of idnetifying the formal techniques that explored these sexual relations have only begun to be identified and in f.n. #75 she lists some works.  She also suggets looking at cotemp. poets who see themselves as decdenents of these 20s female writers and mentions Veverley Dahlen, Susan Howe, and Kathleen Fraser, esp. Fraser ""whose own work could be said to splice feminine poetics with a logopoeic attention to language, recognizes the importance of the female modernists to this contemporary project...Burke also notes that female writers in this tradition often wrote in HOW(ever), edited by FRaser.

"Consciousness and Society: The Reorientation of European Social Thought, 1890-1930","<p>002 The Decade of the 1890s</p>
<p>*&nbsp; This chapter traces a radical shift in the way in which ""advanced thinkers"" working ""independently of one another...underwent a critical review from which there emerged the new assumptions characteristic of our time.""&nbsp; (33) Right at the outset he quotes Talcott Parsons' <em>The Structure of Social Action</em>.&nbsp; Note that I know from Giddens' article ""Classical Social Theory and the Origins of Modern Sociology"" that Parsons is a major originator of what Giddens calls this ""great divide"" thesis that sociology radically changed in the 1890s.&nbsp; Seems that Hughes is following Parsons on this.</p>
<p>* In characterizing the central thrust of thsi revolt, Hughe rejects romanticism--sicne many of these thinkers such as Sorel, Pareto, Durkheim, and Freud ""though of themsevles as engineers or technicians, men of science or medicine."" (36)&nbsp; He also rejections anti-intellectualism, and irrationalism (35, 36).&nbsp; Ultiamtely he says that the 1890s is best characterized as a ""revolt against positivism"" -- though this too has problems.&nbsp; (37).</p>
<p>* But then he asks, how did positivism appear?&nbsp; These writers did not use the term very specifically and used it interchangeably with othe rthings they disliked: ie materialism, mechanism, and naturalism.&nbsp; Hughes specifies the intellectual construct that these thinkers opposed as emerging with the merger of positivist philosophy--originally an ""intellectualist philosophy, basing itself on the convinction that thep problems of man in society were readily capable of a rational solution"" (38) with Social Darwinism:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">""Under the influence of Social Darwinism...the positivist creed began to shed its rationalist features: 'heredity' and 'environmetnt' repalced conscious,logical choice as the main determinants of human action.&nbsp; A Hobbesian state of nature (now called 'struggle for existence') was substituted for decorous social order as the characteristic view of the relations between man and man.&nbsp; The result was a kind of fatalism--the antithesis of the buoyantly optimistic attitude that had characterized the philosophers of the eighteenth century or the English Utilitarians of the irst part of the century following.&nbsp; The ultimate irony of positivism was that what had started as an an ultra-intellectualist doctrine became in effect a philosohpy of radical anti-intellectualism."" {NOTE: Here too, just to indicate how much Hughes may have been influenced by Parsons, he he has quoted only Parsons <em>Structure</em>, pp. 64. 67, 111-114.&nbsp; Also keep in mind his own belief in the rationalism of the 18th century Enlightenment... } (39)</p>
<p>Hughes main point here is that in this intellectual context the <strong>thinkers of the 1890s were ""aiming at precisely the opposite of what they have usually been accused of doing.&nbsp; Far from being 'irrationalists,' they were seeking to restroe the freely speculating mind to the dignity it had enjoyed a century earlier."" </strong>(39)</p>
<p>* Hughes argues that the broader intellectual climate of the 1870s and 1880s had been ""stuffy"" and that ""the epoch exuded a sense of heaviness, of material excess, of confinement.""&nbsp; (40)</p>
<p>* Then in the 1890s, doubts emerged both on what he calls the ""lower"" and ""higher"" levels of intellectual activity (41).&nbsp; One cause: that the ""institutional arrangements of the major Western European states were againts brought into question."" (41)&nbsp; The ""artificial, contrived characters of the regimes with which unification had endwed Germany and Italy were revealed by their malfunctioning..."" (41)&nbsp; In France, the Dreyfus case ""acted as a stimulus tot he re-examination of the traditoinal ideologies onw hich both the defenders and the enemeies of theaccused captaied had rested their case."" (41)&nbsp; Social disorder, institutinoal problems, and economic crisis led to the rise of European socialism in the 1890s also.&nbsp; (41)</p>
<p>* Because of the power of Marxism and of European socialism, the task of coming to terms with Marxism ""was the first and ost obvious task confronting the intellectual innovators of the 1890s."" (42)</p>
<p>* Now Hughes looks at the different ""tasks of cultural re-evaluation"" in the main Westenr and Central European nations, starting with Germany (42-51), then Vienna (51-53), then Frrance (53-61), and finally Italy (62-63).</p>
<p>Finally, and most importantly, Hughes sums up the ""major ideas that were intiially stated in the 1890s, prepartory to their fuller elaboration in the first decade of the twentieth century."" (63)</p>
<p>1) Most basic H says was their interest in ""the problem of consciosness and the role of the unconscious."" (63)&nbsp; Problem implicit in Bergon's first book: <em>Essay on the Immediate Data of Consciousness</em>.&nbsp; Bergson talked about the ""depths"" of consciousness and a ""deep-seated self"" that followed its own logic, as distinct from a ""sueprficial psychic life."" (64) The recovery of this ""fundamental self"" is the project that Freud brings to fruition in his <em>Interpretation of Dreams</em>.</p>
<p>2) Related to the problem of consciousnes: ""the question of the meaning of time and duration in psychology, philosophy, literature, and history."" (64)&nbsp; Bergson particularly interested in this in an effort to ""define the nature of subjective existence as opposed the schematic order that the natural sciences had imposed on the external world."" (64)&nbsp; But natural scientists themselves exploring this problem as the world they studied no longer appeared to fit the laws of Newtonian physics. (64)&nbsp; Something that novelists also obdsesses with as aprt of problem of ""how to recapture the immediacy of past experience in langauge that in orderanary usage could reproduce no mroe than the fragmentized reality of an existence that the logical memory had arleady stored away in neat compartments."" (65)</p>
<p>3) Espitemology of knowledge in waht Dilthey called the ""sciences of the mind.""&nbsp; (65) Dilthey tried to ""establish rules that would separate the areas in which the human mind strove for some kind of internal comprehension from the realm of external and pruely converntional symbols devised by natural science."" (65)&nbsp; Croce picked this up a decade later and by 1900 it had become apparent that ""the nineteenth-century program of building an edifice of historical and sociolgoical knowledge by pateiebnt accumation and painstatking verifiation no longer sufficed.&nbsp; By such means it would forever be impossible to penetrate eneath the surface of human experience.&nbsp; One had, rather, a choice between the exercise of the sympathetic intutiion postualted in Croce's neio-idealistic theory of history, and teh creation of sueful fictions, as max Weber was later to elaborate them, as models for cricial understanding."" (65)</p>
<p>4) So as a consquence of this shaking of the foundation of human knowledge, so too had teh ""whole basis of political discussion"" been altered.&nbsp; The ""ratioanlsitic ideologies inehreted from the 18th century--wheether socialism or liberalism--woudl no longer suffice.&nbsp; One had to ""penetrate beyond"" these ""myths"" and here the ""discussion of politics"" would move 'from the rhetoric of public discussion to the manipualtion of half-consciosu sentiments."" (66) So H writes that the ""axis of social thought"" had shifted ""from the apparent and objectively verifiable to the only partially conscious area of unexplained motivation."" (66).&nbsp; So these new doctrines were ""manifestly subjective."" (66)&nbsp; On the flip side, since the mind had been freed from the limits of positivism and needed to rely on intutiion etc, the mind was ""at lberty to speculate, to imagine, to cereate.""</p>"
Crisis,"<p>Notes 10/17/2011:</p>
<p>* The basic framework of the development of the concept of crisis laid out in the introduction is: The term begins among the Greeks for whom it functions in the ""spheres of law, medicine, and theology"" and for whom it ""imposed choices between stark alternatives--right or wrong, salvation or damnation, life or death."" (358)&nbsp; The medical meaning is dominant until the early modern period, when in the 17th century the term is taken up into the new spheres of politics, economics, history, and psychology.&nbsp; At the end of the 18th century, the theological meaning of the term comes to the fore, ""but by its appplication to the events of the French and American revolutions, the apocalyptic vision of the last judgement now acquired a secular meaning."" (358)&nbsp; Through this application and the terms ""metaphorical flexibility"" it becomes a ""central catchword (<em>Schlagwort)</em>"" and in the 20th century ""there is virtually no area of life that has nto been examined and interpreted through this concept with its inherent dmeand for decisions and choices."" (358)</p>
<p>* Within the realm of history, Koselleck notes the term crisis since 1780 made possible a ""new sesne of time whcih both indicated and intensified the end of an epoch."" (358)&nbsp; So he insists that ""[p]erceptions of such epochal change can be measured by the increased usae of crisis."" (358)</p>
<p>* He also makes a point at a couple of stages that there are emotions attached to the notion of crisis.&nbsp; This is interesting vis-a-vis the historial study of emotions these days, although I don't think Koselleck is making much out of this.&nbsp; (358)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Greek Usage</strong></p>
<p>* The Greek meaning: this is well laid out: In Greek it comes from a verb meaning to separate, choose, judge, decide.&nbsp; Ie it had a <strong>juridical meaning</strong>. And in classical Greek the term was key to politics., where it meant in part to make a ""decision"" ""in the sense of reaching a verdict or a judgement, what today is meant by criticism (<em>Kritik)</em>."" (359) So he says that in classical Greek, crisis fused the concepts, since separated, of ""subjective critique"" and ""objective crisis."" (359)&nbsp; This concept of crisis attained a ""high constitutional status"" in the ""court"" where ""the individual citizen and the community were bound together."" So crisis was a term that defined adn order the civic community as a legal title and legal code, and Aristotle frequently used the term in this way.&nbsp; Out of this specifically legal meaning the term acquires political significance as it is ""extended to eelectoral decision, government resolutions, decisions of war and peace, and, above all, to government decisisions as such."" (359)&nbsp; The notion of crisis becomes ""necessary for the community, representing&nbsp; what is at once just and salutary."" (359)&nbsp; So for the Greeks, they say, ""'crisis' was a central concept by which justince and the political order (<em>Herrschaftsordnung) </em>could be harmonized through appropriate legal decisions."" (359)</p>
<p>*&nbsp; To the juridical meaning there is added <strong>a theological meaning</strong> in the Septuaginta (ancient Greek translation of the Old and New Testament.)&nbsp; The idea here is that God is the Judge, a principle central to the Jewish tradition.&nbsp; God's judgement thus contains the possibility of salvation, and in the notion of the Last Judgement, the notion of crisis gains meaning in relation to the end of the world at which point final judgement will finally reveal true justice. For Christians, who l,ived in antiicpation of the Last Juidgement, crisis was somehow present already in the moral conscience even though the crisis had not yet occurred.&nbsp; ""Even while crisis remains open as a cosmic event, it is already taking place within one's conscience."" (360)</p>
<p>* There was also a <strong>medical meaning</strong> among the Greeks that originated in the <em>Corpus Hippocraticum</em> and that Galen ""firmly entrenched for about fifteen hundred years."" (360)&nbsp; In th is realm, crisis refers both to the ""observable condition"" and to the <em>judgement</em> about whether the patient will live or die.&nbsp; A distinction was made in this domain between the notion of a perfect and imperfect crisis--the latter leaving open the possiblity of a relapse of the condition.&nbsp; (360)</p>
<p>* The term was then adopted into latin where it underwent a ""metaphorical expansion into the domains of social and political language."" (361)&nbsp; Here, they say, it took on meaning as a ""transitional or temporal concept (<em>Verlaufsbegriff</em>) ie indicating ""that point in tmi in which a decision is due but has not yet been rendered."" (361)</p>
<p>* They then assert somewhat mysteriously that ""since then"" the term has taken on a ""double meaning."" 1) Referring to the ""objective condition"" of crisis, the diagnosis of which is under debate and depends upo ""the judgmeental critiera used to diagnose that condition."" (361) 2) Its relationship to the concept of illness means that the term ""presupposes a staet of health--however conceived--that is either to be restored again or which will, at a specified time, result in death."" (361)</p>
<p><em>Note: I am thinking about the dominant influence of this medical meaning: yes it is fair to presuppose a state of ""health"", and also what about the way this leads to a tendency to conceive of society in terms of the organismic metaphor.&nbsp; Ie crisis seems to lend itself to the functionalist conceptioin of society as organism, Durkheim et al.&nbsp; Soemthign to keep in mind....</em></p>
<p><strong>The Adoption Into National Languages</strong></p>
<p><em>Skipping detailed notes here, but what they are doing is tracing the entrance of the concept into national languages in the 17th century.&nbsp; The term, they assert, could only become influential and central after it ""its tras is the Chrynsfer into national languages.""&nbsp; It appears first in French in the accusative ""crisin"".&nbsp; It is applied to the ""body politic"" in England during the Civil War.&nbsp; IE Ruydyerd uses in 1627: ""This is the&nbsp; Chrysis of Parliaments; we shall know by this if Parliaments life or die."" (362) .&nbsp; In France, Leibniz uses it to ""diagnose the opporutnites and angers of the emerging Russian Empire and the Nordic War..."" in which he saw """"a change of fundamental world-hsitorical significance comparable onlz to the formationof Charlemagne's empire."" (363)&nbsp; They trace the emergence of the term in lexica and dictionaries,noting that it enters latest into the German context, circa mid 19th century. Indeed, some Sonderweg thesis moments here perhaps? when they say that in Germany that ""the term never crystallized intoa&nbsp; concept sufficiently clear to be used as a basic concept in soical, economic, or political language--despite or perhaps because of--its manifold meanings."" (367) <strong>But the point is that partly even in Germany the term had after the mid-18th century ceased to be lexically peripheral and ""could indeed become an indicator of and contributor to a widesespread sense of radical change..."" (367)</strong></em></p>

            <text>
            This antagonism between thinking and thought is also in Saussure.  In his distinction between paradigmatic
            and syntagmatic coordinating signs (1966:123).  Syntagmatic ordering is ""linear sequence of signs wheere
            each sign acquires its value in opposition to preceding and following signs in discourse."" (22)  Paradigmatic
            ""orderings are nonlinear and are formed outside of discourse.  They are assocaited relations which are not 
            present in the discourse itself.  they are absent potentialities, mnemonic wholes in the inner storehouse 
            of ideas that make up language. A word thus evokes everything associated with it; it is the center of a 
            constellation of thoughts, the point of convergence or departure in a synchronous whole whose parts are 
            indefinite and indeterminant."" (22)    That distinction in Saussure matches his between ""static (synchrony)
            and evolutionary (diachrony)""...in which he divides language into axiis of simulatenous = paradigmatic and
            succesive = syntagmatic.  (22)  Synchrony and diachrony are, Tyler says, Saussure's equivalents to the 
            quandry of quantum mechanics that ""linguistics cannot at the same time describe both position and movement
            (structure and change) and speakers cannot at once attend equally to the sequence of ideas and their synchrony.""
            (22)  Ultimately, Tyler says, Saussure supresses one of these.  The logic of associating the scholastics calleed
            the ""logic of Lucifer"" and it is just this that Saussure thinks will be linguistics key to becoming a science.
            ""For Saussure, the synchronic perspective is the only proper one.  Diachronic study yields a mass of unrelated 
            singularities, it does not yield a system.  Diachrony is merely a record of the accidental effects of speech
            on language, of changes in the synchronic structure produced by all the forces of social life."" (23) <em>  Tyler
            says that Saussure's endorsement of the synchronic/paradigmatic, of <i>langue</i>, was an attempt to free
            the paradigmatic from sequentiality.  Moreover it is linked to modernism he says: ""It is partof the modernist
            program for undermining the individual, the self-mastered self, taking away its conscious control over language
            it speaks much as Freud took away its conscious control over the thoughts it thinks."" (23)</em>

"The plain and noble garb of truth: nationalism & impartiality in American historical writing, 1784-1860","<p>General Notes</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p># Eileen Ka-May Cheng, *The Plain and Noble Garb of Truth: Nationalism and Impartiality in American Historical Writing, 1784-1860* (Atlanta: The University of Georgia Press, 2008)<br /><br />Quick Summary:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cheng is in this book arguing that the historical consciousness of early ninteenth century historians was not as intellectually shallow and narrowly driven by American exceptionalism as has been commonly assumed, even she thinks by Dorothy Ross. She wants to argue that even antebellum historians were operating with a surprising complex set of theoretical and methodological principles that included conceptions of objectivity or impartiality, of history as a sort of art involving emotional sympathy with historical actors, and as a kind of moral philosophy that taught through specific examples and that put the historian in the role of the judge. She seeks to present this account in a non-teleological manner (ie she is distancing herself from the grand narratives of modernity that objective historians worked out). She achieves this in part by organizing her book thematically, rather than linearly. DR has an excellent review of this book along with one by Parker....<br /><br />Critical Note:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some things that come to mind here: why is she not actually going through the specific claims that these historians make. It is interesting to know there approach to the concept of history, but how does this modify their take on the big questions. If, as in ch.2, history as a moral teacher is key, what sort&nbsp; of moral lessons does history teach? How do the different appraoches to historical practice that these historians pursue interact with the claims that they make.<br /><br />## Introduction<br /><br />* There is a view of early American historians-- that they were shallow, that they glorified the revolutionaries, and that they were thoroughly impartial, and unconcerned with impartiality. Cheng thinks that's a myth. She believes that American historiography in the early nineteenth century was complex and sophisticated, and that by the 1820s in fact Amercian historians had begun to develop some of the concepts that would characterize modern historiography. Here she departs from historians like Thomas Haskell that identify the emergence of these ideas---about objectivity e.g. -- in the late nineteenth century. (2, 5)<br /><br />* She is working against a kind of ""Whiggish"" narratives -- she cites Novick on this (4) -- among historians that has lead them to ignore historiography, and ninteenth century historioggraphy in aprticular, becuase they un self-consciously identify with the Rankean ideal that history is just an objective engagement with sources. So they ignore historiography and imagine themselves only to be doing purely objective history.<br /><br />* She thinks that attention to historiography allows her to look at the notion of impartiality historically and thus to show that in fact that throughout its history the ""ideal of objectivity was a powerful and malleable doctrine that could be adapted to many different social contexts and functions, which suggests that historians will find ways of adapting the ideal yet again to the challenges that confront it today."" (6) So whereas Novick in his account of the threats to objectivity seemed to think that revealing the problems that historians confronted in the ideal would also show that the ideal was weak and perhaps dead, she wants to say that is not the case!&nbsp; (see this argument vv Nnovick, bottom p.5).&nbsp; So she says ""recognizing the social and political function of impartiality does not necessarily endanger a belief in truth or the integrity of the discipline."" (6)<br /><br />* She also wants to demonstrate that the idea that American historians were impartial because they followed nationalist accounts of American exceptionlism, she wants to show that to the contrary ""rather than obstructing the development of this ideal, nationalist imperatives paradoxcially contributed to their desire for impartial truth."" (6) So she is drawing on, but also contending against Dorothy Ross's account of American exceptionalism. And she takes DR's stance to by typical of ""modern"" American historians. She thinks this stance is ironically exceptionlist in that it reveals exceptionalist attitudes that assume the intellectul shallowness of American intellectual history. (NOte, I don't think this is a very good critique of DR's work, for I think she pretyy much avoids that. What she is interested in showing is how complex and rigorous was the attempt to sustain an exceptionalist account of American history... ) )6-7.<br /><br />* She describes the antebellum historains's notion of history on 8-11. She summarizes their notion of impartiality, which has them acknowledging that there are multiple sides to a story and then acting as a judge in saying which one is better, but often for moral reasons, because they saw history as a kind of actulization of moral philosphy. And they joined their notions of impartiality to a Rommantic conception of historical writing as a kind of artistiic endeavour that required historians to develop emotional sympathy with their historical actors, since they understood taht to be necessary to getting into the lives of those people and representing their eventy impartially.<br /><br />* She describes her effot to avoid a teleologicl account of history by using a thematic organization in her book on p. 11.<br /><br />## 1. ""To Become a Historian"": A Discipline and a Society in Transition<br /><br />&gt; Not taking extensive notes here. This chapter traces the rise of a group of historians who are functioning something like a profession, but in a less formal/ institutional / bureacuratic manner.<br /><br />## 2. ""Histories in Novels,"" ""Novels in Histories"": Imagination, Fact, and the Moral Truths of History<br /><br />&gt; This chapter traces the way in which these historians defined historical truth in realtion to the three most central parts of their practice: questions of fact, imagination, and moral lessons. The idea of the chapter is&nbsp; basically that while many of the historians defined history in a RAnkean way as defined by the need to represent history actually as it was and to avoid the intrusion of imagination, which was for them a distoring factor that they associated with novels-- a feminine form. But there were other historians--namely Jared Sparks, and especially William Simms, who saw imagination as central to the illumination of history. Here the key was the moral concept of history. For Simms, imagination aided the historian in the task of illuminating the past in a way that allows history to teach moral lessons.</p>"
When Sex Became Gender,"<p>Quick Note</p>
<p>This book looks at feminist thought from interdisciplinary sources in the 40s and 50s.  She's arguing that this thought had a kind of power indepdnetly of the feminist movement that sprang up in the 60s and 70s from which certain lessons can be learned.  The book came to my attentino because she pciks up in one chapter the fac tthat Mead had begun to work out a gender concept.</p>
<p>It occured to me that this book might be useful in loking more closely at the tension between Mead's thought (and a broader set of feminist thinkers) and the structural functionalism of this period.  The author brings this up in the the intro on p.7.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>"
On Creating a Usable Culture: Margaret Mead and the Emergence of American Cosmopolitanism,"<p>1. Introduction</p>
<p>* She's concerned with the self.  Right off the bat, in the first paragraph, she say ""Running through Mead's work is a sustained commentary on the self and its relation to the larger society.  It is one of the arguments of this study that the self as represented is not just any individual but is in some sense both an American self and the self of America.""  (1)For her there is a link between the attempt to define the self and to define the nation.  E.e. she says in the next sentence ""What the nation/self might be or what it might become was the subject of much debate [in the 1920s.]"" (1)</p>
<p>* Molloy brings up modernism and the works of Hegeman and Manganaro on p.3, but it's unclear how she conceives of modernism here.  Perhaps she defines it later.  She almost seems to confuse it with ""American modernity.""  She pick sup on Manganaro's differenct readings of what was modernist about culture: for Manganaro the idea of a complex whole readable synchronistically like the professional literatures and moes of reading; for HEgeman the sense of self-conscious estranement. (3-4)</p>
<p>* She gets into how she's thinking about the self via Charles Taylor on p.7.  She quotes a description by Taylor of a ""modern self"": ""...a 'disengaged, particular self, whose identity is constituted in memory.'' (7)  Then she traces two themes in discussion of the modern self: ""On theme, which I have called <em>eventuation</em>, sees 'the shape of alife simply the <em>result</em> of...happenings as they accumulate.'  The second, which I call <em>actualization</em>, sees 'this shape as something already latent, which emerges through what comes to pass.'"" (7)  She sees these two themes ""ramifying"" through ""many of the discursive forms of modernity, underpinning the emergence of both the novel and the autobiography"" as weell as the social sciences and the nature-nurture debates in particular. (7-8)  Eslewhere she describes this as a tension between seeing the self as constitued by ""event"" or ""esence"" (8).</p>
<p>* The tension between seeing the self as constiitued either by event or essence has its paralllel she thinks in discussion  fthe nation., i.e. concerns with ""origins, with unity, and the repressions of difference, with boudnaries and interiority."" (8)  She notes the scholarly concern with the way the nation is narrated i nstories, hsitory books, stories, etc... (10) She esees these tension as caolescin in the race/culture debate in the 1920s.  She draws on the work of some guy named Robert Young and then Walter Benn Micahels to argue that race and culture were both essential parts of the modern discourse...i.e. they were part of the same tension between event and essence in understanding the origin/unity of the nation/self. (9-10)</p>
<p>* On 11, she gets out another focus of her work: ""how the modernist ideas about culture were transformed into vernacular understandings of culture through the vehicle of Mead's work."" (11)  She sets this focus agains that of Manganaro and HEgeman who she sees as focusing on the concept of culture and the ""texts that ciruclted within rareified or professional fields...""  IN this respect, she sees her book as more closely linked to Micahaels ""in its emphasis on something less well defined than a concept..."" (11)</p>
<p>* She will deal with MEad's major ethnographies and she will trace a growin ""disillusionment with 'culture'"".  (13)  In Coming of Age, she argues, culture ""significes the possibilities for change or for more-fulfilling ways of life."" (13), but by the time she  writes Sex and Temperament ""culture is fullya rticulated as that which creates deviance by not allowing individual, innate temperament to develop accoridng to its natural predilections and potentialities."" (13)  [NOTE: My interpretation differs sharply here.  I see culture as already limiting in Coming of Age, but in a way that is so powerful that it limits the selves of Samoa so that they actually think that they are free and possess a molding power...that is it determines even how they understand their own actions in a way that is distorted.  Then, overall, my argument is different because I see MEad and Benedict as locating individuality in deviance...this is the sign that there is some individaulity left!]</p>
<p> </p>
<p>* If Taylor defines the modern self as one constitued in a ""story,"" Med's story in her ethnographies ""was the most compelling of all-the self's transition from childhood to adulthood, and the struggles that shape that transition."" (14)  RE CArolyn STeedman's notion of ""personification"" and the ""figure of a child"" as a focus that has to do with self-formation this is a powerful argument.  So Molloy sees Mead as tracing in her work a ""personficiation of the self's journey from childhood to adulthood."" (15)  So she sees Mead's interest in the Manus boy or the Samoan girl or the deviant as a way of studhing the ""problem of 'coming into being' not only in their own culture but more importantly in America."" (15)</p>
<p>* In addtion she says ""sex is the ynchpinin each of these narratives...""  (15)  But it is not clearl what she means by sex...sexuality?  or sex identity?  Also, are the ethnographies really ""narratives"".  When I read them, they did not seem to be so...although she does tell the stories of different individuals...</p>"

The Naturalized Female Intellect,"<p>p.210 She will explore concepts of nature through ideas on female intellect</p>
<p>Soimplified understanding of ""Nature"" in Science Studies.  Daston asays that the ""context-dominated science studies of th elats decade"" used naturalization very heavily as a way to explain connection between science and social context: ""Galileo, for example, 'naturalizes' the shaky political legitimacy of the Medicis by christening th newly discovered moons of Jupiter in their honor..."" (210).</p>
<p>She thinks that this use of naturalization projects a ""recent conception of nature"" that based on a strong boundary between nature and culture, back onto the past.In the early-modern period, she says, the conception of naturte was changing from ""essences to matter, from what is desirable to what is inevitable, from the sovereignty of reason to that of physical necessity.""&nbsp; (210)</p>
<p>She will reinterpret it through looking at ""early modern conceptions of the female intellect..."" (210)&nbsp; This is a good way to look at the shfiting conception of nature she says because women's way of thinking was attributed to gender (as is the case withi gender); because the ""political and social implications"" of women's intellect were heavily debated; and because throughout this period the basic ""content of beliefs"" about female intellect remained the same: ""It is thus possible to isolate and track these naturalist expalnations as a pure exercise in changing forms and standards of explanation per se, without addressing the conflating issue as to how new <em>explananda</em> might have influenced the course of these changes.""

Herbert: 
architecht of AHA.  He ""fostered the union of professors and patricians"" Higham says.  (Is this true?  I thought he rejects their bid for alliance, did Haskell say this?) (11)  He was a New Englander, puritian stock, but not related to the elite Adamses.  His public service ""epxressed itself through his connection with the U.S. Bureau of Education, for which he wrote and edited a long series of pamphlets on the histroy and current state of American education."" (12) He schemed to start an academy in Washington to train ""professional civil servants much as West Point and Annapolis trianed officers."" (12) Adams enjoyed the elitism of Eastern society.  (12) Under his auspices the AHA (run by professionals) regualrly selected patrician scholars or other distinguished people as president (13) He also attempted to attach the AHA to the government, seeking in 1889 to gain a federal charter for the AHA. On this:

""This unusual act of incorporation fixed the principal office of the Associaiton permanently in Washington, and authorized it to report annually to the Smithsoanian Institution.  the latter was directed to transmit to Congress the AHA's proceedings and its reportsonthe condition of historical study in America.  Adams thereby secured at goverment expense both office space and the printing of his annual reports.  More important, he opened a channel through which the aristocracy of culture might, in historical matters, exert a vigorous, uplifting ifluence on national policies."" (14) 

But this failed Higham says: ""In America, unlike Adams' beloved Germany, professors and other guardians of culture did not succeed in establishing a sold parternship with the state.  During the Jacksonian period the intellectual class in American hda lost its political eminence, and all efforts to recover that eminence in the late nineteenth-century were unavailing.  In the early 1890's commitees of the American Historical Association began memorializing Congress to take heed of the nation's scattered and neglected historical records.  The scholars wanted a unified management of the national archives; they also pleaded for a Historical Manuscripts Commission tha towuld-- like the British agency of that name -- inventory important papers in private hands.  Congress did nothing.  Any prospect that it would seriously notice the annual reports it still receives fromthe Association soon vanished.  The arrangement continues today as a useful economy in scholarly printing expenses and as a memorial of the forgotten hopes of Herbert Baxter Adams."" (14) 

Henry:
Henry Adams also tried to start a link between government and patrician intellectuals in 1880s by establishing a asalon in Lafayette Squarein 1877.  But the captial did not become ""a genuine capital in the sense in which almost every European country had a national center of wealth, knowledge, intellect, fashion, and political power."" (15)  Henry's salon circle thus contracted ..."
Alexander Goldenweiser's Politics,"<p>Quick Summary 7/9/10:</p>
<p>Kan's article has a lot of good info on the political attitudes toward communism and the Soviet Union of Goldenweiser, Boas, and Leslie White.  It's useful in this way.  He shows that Boas had a hard time criticizing the Soviet Union durin ghte 1930s, at the same time as he was open in his opposition to the Nazis.  Goldenweiser was more critical of the SU.  This article has a lot of info that could be mined for my work later on, esp. if I try to do more on Goldenweiser later.</p>"
Cultural Turns: Neuorientierungen in den Kulturwissenschaften,
Proletarianization and Educated Labor,"Professionalization re Abbott and Parsons

 Abbott cites this guy.  see p. 86-87 of System of Professions.  Larson he note emphasized ""professional pwer in exculsive terms, as power at other's expense."" (87).  One can perhaps place Larson's work by looking at these pages of Abbott, since Abbott goes from Prasons through larsons to his own focus on ""jurisdiction."" There is also a moment where Larson deals with Parsons theme of expertise, rendering it however more in terms of ""exlusive"" power in the
 sense of this being a ""monopoly  system (aided by the state) over expertise.  (142)"
Beyond Separate Spheres: Intellectual Roots of Modern Feminism,<p>p.084 CHAPTER 4: TOWARDS A SEXLESS INTELLIGENCE</p>
The Naturalized Female Intellect,"<p>p.217-220 Causes of Female Intellect</p>
<p>Both 17th and 18th century explanations were tied to differences in bodies, but the expalanations changed in this period.  In the late 17th centjury, explanations by ""complexion"" were still common, but they were ""gradually supersided in discussion of gender differences by appeals to the relative 'delicacy' of female organs."" (217)</p>
<p>""Thus the Sieur de Saint-Gabriel called on the authority of 'the Philosohers and the Doctors' to supprt his claim that because of the 'tenuousness of their skin and the delicacy of their flesh' wome had 'more vivactiy of understanding, having a more subtle imaginations.'"" (217)</p>
<p>This was a ""bizarre twist"" of the Aristotle's linking of masculine form over feminine matter to elevate form  over matter and to associate the former with men and the latter with  women in his <em>De generatione animalium</em>.  But in the late seventeenth century version of this the female was opposed to ""gross matter.""  (217)  Thus here ther ewas a kind of defense of women based on their delicacy and their openness to the ""impressions of science"":</p>
<p>""As for delicacy, apparently those who make this a subject of accusation to them [women] have nto followed Aristotle's opinion: they would then have kjnown that the most delicate temp[erament is the least charged with matter; the most pure and best suited to be penetrated by the lights of the mind; the best preapred for the beautiful images and the impressions of science."" (217)</p>
<p>Complimenting female delicacy was male ""strength, both of body and of mind."" (217)  And in the 18th century, writers who DAston said hoped to restrict the ""influence and educational opportunities of women converted 'delicacy' into 'weakness' and made it the key to the feminine character, intellect, and social situation."" (218)    ""Thus jurists pronounced men 'by the prerogative of their sex and by the force of their tempearment' to be 'naturally capapble of all kinds of employment and engagements,' while simultaneously excluding women, 'due to the fraigilty of their sex and their natural delicacy.'"" Here she is quoting d'Alembert an Diderot.  (218) BAsed on the idea that they were weak, authors now argued that housework and child care was the necessary role of women.  See p.218 for examples.  She cites Pierre Roussel as the most extereme.  Roussel she says ""litearly bodied out Rousseau's claim that 'the male isonly a male now and again, the fameale is alaways a female or at least all her youth; eeryting reminder her of her sex; the performance of her functions required a special constitution.  According to Roussel, not only the reproductive organs, but also the skeleton, ligaments, tissues, nerves, and vessels are 'marked by the differences that display the functions to which woman is called, and the passive state to which nature destines her.'  Female orans are, Roussel claimed, soft, delicate, small, and elastic in comparison to those of male, and from this fundamental distinction he read off all the cliches of feminine intellect and cahracter.  The mobitliy and sensitivity of her tender organs endwo woman with the ability to seize at a glance 'an infinity of nuances, of items of detail, and relkationships that escape the most enlightened man""; her morlaity is dictated by sentiment and compassion; her good memory, mental agility, and animated conversation repair th eomissions of the long studies her fragile frame cannot support without draining her 'vital forces'"" (218)</p>
<p>The link between the traits Roussel desscribed and female anatomy were not new.  Waht was new here was the ""doctrine of the physical weakness, in conjunction with the ever more insistent emphasis on women's confinement to the home and hearth because of that weakness..."" (219)</p>
<p>This shift put the copmplemenatrity between male and female  on a ""new axis, that of <strong>the abstract versus the concerete.""</strong> (219)</p>
<p>The limited sphere of the home ""implied limited experience and limited activity, and experience and activity came to be seen as increasingly important to intellectual develkopment i the last quater of the eighteenth century.""  So this meant that ""the old female bastion of memory and imagination could nto withstand the call to braoad experience and vigorous activity: the 'sedentary and soft life' of women could at best foster an imagination of pretty scenes and tender emotions,b ut this paled beside the imagination of the 'always active man...nourish on moutnain peaks, at the edge of volcanoes, at sea, in battlefields, or in the midst of ruins.'"" (219)  This emphais was increased by the aesthetic of sublime.</p>
<p>Even Wollstonecraft supported these assumptions.  She had rejected Rousseau's ""double standard of virtue for the two sexes"" but she accepted that men were stronger and linked bodily to meantal vigor...she admitted all this but then exhorted women not to exacerbate the situation by inactivity and by allowing themselves to be ""deluded by the conveitonal opinion that delicacy added to their charms."" (219) Daston argues that Wolstonecraft ""in her descripton of these infirmities and her assocaition of them with physical weakness and hte narrow exepreince apparently dicated by that weaknes...closely resembled those of such writers as Roussel and BAbanis, for whom sexual cahracter admitted only of slight modification..."" (220) And she also agreed taht women's weakenss =&gt; limited sphers =&gt;  made their field of experiences only ""social relations"" that taught ""effects and modifications"" but not ""simple principles"" and that this utlimately ""barred them from the abstract, general principels necessary for sicence and for justice."" (220)</p>
<p>Now the abstract v. concrete dynamic emerges and it was in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries made clear:</p>
<p>""In the late eitghteenth and early nineteenth centuries the age-old oppositions between female memory and imagination versus male discursive and speculative reason were reformulated and condensed into an oppostion between the female grasp of concrete details and the male mastery of abstract principles.  Kant for example firmly discouraged women from deep study in metaphysics and mathematics on the grounds that their 'beautiful understanding [schoner Verstand]' was incompatible with 'abstract speculations or knowledge, which are useful but dry.'  Rousseau's formulation was characteristically preemptory: 'The search for abstract and speculative truths, for principles and axioms in science, for allt hat tends to wide generalisation, is beyond a woman's grasp; ...works of genius are beyond her reach, and hse has neither the accuracy nor the attention for success in the exact sciences; as for the physical sciences, to decide the relations between living createres and the laws of nature is the task of that sex which is more active and enterprising, which sees more thing, that sex which is possessed of greater strength and is more acccustomed to the exercise of that strength.'  (220)</p>

He never lets the actual authors speak. It is all his own summaries. This highlights a deeper functionalist approach to ideas that is often accurate, but severely lacking in that it never gets at the deeper motivations of these people. There are just ideological ""patterns"" responding in that functionalist manner that one would expect. On another level a core argument here is that the form of cultural science set up by Waitz, Virchow and Bastian in Berlin in the 1870s and 1880s was ""neoliberal"", but he barely defines this idea. Perhaps he was writing before the term really took off in contemporary discourse. What he seems to mean is simply the attempt to reground the liberal conception of the ""abstract self"" on more scientific and accurate ground. That&nbsp; might have been neo, but it's now what we mean by neoliberalism today. And he never carefully defines his usage so as to avoid confusion. <br /></span></p>

Smith says Bastian is a key exponent also. Bastian had travelled widely and thus come into contact with many many different peoples aroudn the world. He was a liberal Smith says -- or rather a ""neoliberal"" whatever that means for Smit -- in that he wanted to use his work to support the traditional liberal theroetical pattern that empahsized the individual, and nomothetic science. His research was built around the goal of discovering fundamental laws, but doing so after ""the direct observation and comparative analysis of a wroldwide sample of human phenomena."" (117) He rejected the Montesquiueian or Herdeerian pattern of linking certain patterns of thought and behavior to physical enviornement. Bastian Smith says believed that a great many infleunces fed into the human mind producing different forms of conscisouness. His resarch frame focused on the individual as was typical of the librerals. He traeted the idea of the abstract individual, however, as a hypothesis of a ""pscyhic unity of mankind"" -- a kind of ""pscyhological foundation that was the same in everyone"", as Smith puts it. But to establish this unity was not easy, and ultimately Bastioan's appraoch was to attempt to demosntrate the existence of certain ""elementary ideas"", that is a uniform structure of ideas (resting on this pscyhic unity of mankind) (118). Interestinglyh, also Bastian thought that these elementary ideas were unconscious. (119) Bastian was also not an evolutionist, but he retained the distinction beteween Kulturvoelker and Naturvoelker. But ultimately Bastian, Smith thinks, did not convincingly establish the existnce of the elementary ideas, in part because he had a poor system for cross-cultural comparison, since he regarded all cultural systems a morally equivalent.

(124) The point of establishhing these basic patterns of relationships among sesnations, feelings and other more complex forms of pscyhic energy was to estaliblish their uniformity in all people thus refinforcing the ""neolliberal"" desire to ""repalce the inadequate model fo the rational individual at the center of the liberal theoretical pattern with a more sophisticated, accurate, and useful picture of the individual mind derived from empirical research...

(125) That is, he conceived of culture as itself an ""active psychic force that had coherence in itself and that to a large extent defined the very individiuals who participated in it.""

<p>## Ch. 7 Bauer, Volk and Kultur: The Paesant as the Foundation of Culture</p>
<p>* This chapter looks at an alternative take on culture to the one that the ""neoliberal"" anthropologists developed, namely that of the more conservative cultural thinkers like Riehl and Ratzel for whom the paesent and agriculture were key to culture. In German, Kultur can mean agriculture or culture and for these thinkers that link was axiomatic. The paeseent was the basis of culture, specifically the German paessent. (129)</p>
<p>* The roots of this view lay in part in the early 19th century romantics enthusaism for the&nbsp; countryside. But also this agrarianism was not set against Vormaerz liberalism in Germany. The Two worked together well. Smith describes on 130-1. He compares two articles from teh Staatslexicon also to show two lines of development, one by Karl mathy, more liberal, and the other by Welcker, a modern liberal, but one who laid out a view of the paesent that showed ideas that ultimately became typical of conservatives like Riehl and Ratzel later on. (131-133).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>## Ch. 8 The Diffusionist Revolt</p>
<p>* Diffusionism developed in the German context as a revolt against the ""neoliberal"" pattern that Smith has described. It came out of Bastian, but it was really developed into an alterantive in the hands first of F. Ratzel, Froebenius, Graebner, and Wilhelm Schmidt.&nbsp; (140)</p>
<p>* The source iin Bastian was due t his argument that the culture of a Volk, i.e. the ""system of folk ideas developed from universal elementary ideas--was a result of adapation to particular geographical areas with distinctive environmental conditions."" (140) So part of Bastian's study was of the paths of cultural traits into certain geographical contexts and a astudy of the ways in which those ideas were then taken up into the new context and ultimately became part of the new Volk's culture. (140-141) So Bastian's work involved a tracing of trait transfer plus a mapping of ""cultural provinces"" (141), but this was not a central part of his theoretical project -- though it was takne more seriously by Richahrd Andree and Franz Boas, two of his followers. (141)</p>
<p>* What Ratzel did was emphasize this set of ideas and placed them in a different theoretical framework that Smith says had ""radically different political connections, including links to agrarianism."" (141) He began that proccess in his early 1882 work *Anthropo-Geographie. Here he self-consciously tried to the kind of human geography that A. Humboldt and Ritter had aimed at. He believed that unlike Ritter and Humboldt he had the right theoretical frame of a modified Darwinism. His version of Darwinism came from Moritz Wagner's theories of migration, also based on Darwin. Wagner liked Darwin's notion of natural selection, but though he'd ignored humans' tendency to spread across the globe, which Wagner viewed as a law. And he assumed that as a people spread out, the more change and diversity that people would hsow. Ratzel took up Wagner's ideas as a way to ground what Smith calls a ""holistic huma geography"" and to justify a ""migrationist colonilaism."" (142)&nbsp; ""Restless movement is the signature of mankind."" he said (142) And he began to see ""the interactions of human groups with various features of terrain,c limatte, and vegetation essentially struture society and history."" (142) That is, he laid out aview in which in Smith's words ""competition between human groups takes place in a spational dimension; the most fundamental struggle is for space itself."" (142)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* So Ratzel's study was based on a study of diffusion. He assumed that he knew the basic framwork of hsitory i.e. migration and adaption in a competetive context -- but he needed to know the details. So he developed a method of diffusionist determination in which he assume that ""if different peoples, physically separates from one another, made material objects in much the same way, it was probably evidence of previous cultural contacts between them."" (142) Then combining Wagner's theories with philological techniques he argued that ""high levels of similairty between individual cultural traits (e.g. in shaping bows) and large numbers of similar traits shared by peoples of different regions were firm evidence of the paths of cutlural diffusion."" (142) Finally, the coexistence in some geographical space of a great number of similar traits indicated a ""Kulturkreis."" (142) Then finally, he assumed that there was a link between metnal traits and physical traits, such that the discoery of such kulturkreise indciated the distinctive patterns of a particular Volk. (143)</p>
<p>* Implications of Ratzel's thoery vv political liberalism:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) individualism: Ratzel was not much interested in the abstract individual, although he accepted certain parts of the model. His theory Smith says depended on being able to predict the rational response of different groups and those reponses had to result to some extent from ""individual rationality."" (143)&nbsp; Yet he undestood rationality very differently than other neoliberals like Bastian did -- who took it as the central object of study. For Ratzel, Smith says, the issuew as varily transparent. ""Human rationality was only an extension of the general mental capabilities of higher vertebrates (which allowed Ratzelto apply 'laws' of animal life and movement ot humans -- if only by implication.)"" (143) In fact, Ratzel was interested in groups, but not for the neoliberal reason that ""culture influenced individual thought..."" (143) Ratzel reversed the liberals thinker here, inferring the characteristics of the indivdiual's mind from the individual's behavior in groups. Smith writes: ""The most important point about the relationship between the individual and the group was that, far from reflecting the manifold capabilities of the individual, the group (or society as a whole), thorugh the division of labor, made up for the very real deficiencies of the average person."" (144) Thus it was a key assumption of Ratzel's thought that humans are naturally uncreative. (144) The only creative types in Ratzel's though bear comparison to the type of creative individuals envirioned in Nietzsche, but Ratzel was just not interested in these types. (144) He was more interested in how once such innovations occur they are adapted by others. He saw adaptions as occcuring most commonly in confrontation with environment, and he saw innovastions as mostly technological, tools or weapons, and sometimes forms of political organization. (144) He viewed cultures then as aggreations of traits. Indeed, Smith says that what Ratzel had done really was to repalce the individual with a new abstration: the trait. (144) He was bothered however by the fact that he could never define the deeper force, ""some life force beneath the trait aggregations that gave them meaning."" (144) Some of his followers , esp. Leo Frobenius, tried to define this force. But in the ""main line of German diffusionist theory"" i, li.le. Ratzel to Graebner to Wilhelm Schmidt, culture were conceived as collectsions of traits. (144)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) nomothetic science:&nbsp; (144-146)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) social change and equilibrium: 146-. Here the pattern was different than the liberals. His theory ""substantially shifted the weight of theory toward a complex historical view in which universal stages of cultural development were subordinated to unique patterns of cultural diffusion."" (146) This is why he was less interested in innovation than in adaption and trait transmission. Because what determine the survival of certain speces/volk was the qualitiy of their traits for adaption. Here though the possibilities were complex because even when a people migrated and essentially conquered they could still be ""absorbed"" by the conquered. In which case, in Ratzel's mind their Volk had lost in the end. But Smith says for Ratzel teh most succesful Volk were those who ""move into a new region and take over, impressing themselves and their culture on the area beecause the array of traits they bring with them allows them to adopt readily to new circumstances."" (146) In this case, they may acquire some new traits, but mostly there has been a kind of transplanting... (146) thus Ratzel tended to refer to successful migrant poulations as ""colonizers"" and he argued that they all shared some common traits: strong agriculture, effecive political organization, military and agritculaturla technology and so on. (147) Ratzel also considered transmission through trade, but downplayed it; for him, it played more of ar ole in shpaing a pople,e than in allowing them to transmit their traiuts. (147) Smith summarizes: ""Migration and adapation, supplemented by occassional innovation and diffusion by trade, are therefore the wellsprings of history. Progress does occur, but not inevitably or in universal stages. It occurs through the aggregation of superior traits by certain peoples, who spread themselves and their cultures over wide areas, absorbing other traits and innovations into their cultural being without losing its essence."" (147) These essences, Ratzel though, were recoverable. Even if a people got separated, they might develop differently, but their commonalities woudl continue to be traceable. (147)</p>
<p>* interestingly Ratzel was not a racist, since he assumed that biological mixing wold always tak eplace. Smith asserts that he was less racist, for example, than Virchow. (147)</p>

Interior States: Institutional Consciousness and the Inner Life of Democracy in the Antebellum United States,"<p># Christopher Castiglia, *Interior States: Institutional Consciousness and the Inner Life of Democracy in the Antebellum United States* (Durham, London: Duke University Press, 2008)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>## Introduction: Interiority and the Problem of Misplaced Democracy</p>
<p>* The context in which he places the books is a debate about the decline of American democracy taht includes Robert Putnam's famous bowling alone essay, as well as a set of other texts that cite a demise of democracy rooted in a decline of ""citizens' capacity to organize themselves for collaborative negotation and public action to rectify injustice and improve associational life in way that take account of divergence expectations and experiences."" (1) -- i.e. a decline in democratic agency; that is, a decline of democratic agency in a conception of democracy in which the word indicates an **end** and not a form of government (see f.n. #2, where C quotes Lummis on this).&nbsp; He cites texts by Crenson and Ginsberg, *Downsizing Democracy*, Lummis, *Radical Democracy* and Smith, *The Politics of Deceit*.</p>
<p>* These critiques rely on what C calls an ""uncomplicated interpellative model of trickle-down ideology."" (1) C's critique si that although privatization is important he doesn't think that it has succeeded in ending democracy... Rather he says it has been ""misplaced."" What he means by that is that the ""we have been encouraged to misrecognize the location of the social, finding it, not in assocaition with others, but in the turbulent and conflicted interiors of our own bodies. The bodily interior has become misunderstood as a social space, as *the* social space of modernity, and it is exclusively within that interior state that citizens are encouraged to develop democratic innovation and the skills of negotiation across differences."" (2)</p>
<p>* He sees it as something that developed in the ninteenth century. What he wants to call the ""nervous state""&nbsp; -- ""with its battles between appetite and restraint, desire and deferral, consciousness and unconsciousness"" -- was developed thruogh ""centuries of public and pscyhological reform, in social terms"" to the end that this nervous interor state became ""a microcosm of the equally riven sociality of nineteenth-century America."" (2) This process meant that ""citizens"" were taugh to preceive ""vigilant self-scrutiny and self-management as effective decmoratic action."" (2) Thus he concludes that it is not that citizens have ""lost"" the capacity to act democratically; they have ""misconceived the realm where that action can achieve its purported ends. While democracy may not be lost, then, it is certainly misplaced."" (2)</p>
<p>* C says that the ""interpellative model"" -- whereby the citizen in living in a state bound by modern legal ideas about individual rights is assumed to have a centered subjectivity -- does not acknolwedge the complexity of subjectivity. He refers to a ""gap"" between the classic interpellative model -- ie the citizen responding ot the politice officer ont he street -- and the internal emotional and pscyhological apparatus that makes that possible. He cites Louis Althusser here and also other ""theorists of subjectivity"" including Foucault, Giles Deleuze,&nbsp; Judith Butler, and Jameson. His point is this subjective dimension cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>* Settting up his model he describes two dynamics, one is ""interiority"" and other is institutionalism:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Not doing this himself, he argues (in Ch.1) that the American ""Founders"" were among the first to seek to ""join deep interiority and civic order"" to produce what he says Foucault called ""disciplinary democracy"". What does this really&nbsp; mean? He says that what they did was to develop a ""philosophy of centralized *feelings* modeled on historically familiar modes of beloning (families, churches, and above all friendships)"" that were however now coneived as ""metaphorical--rather than embodied and local--simulacra of the government."" (3)I&nbsp; So this is **interiority**. He is not arguing that interiority began here but that this was a development. He emphasizes here that his idea is that the individual was not simply a private realm of desire affect and apetite, but that this interority was ""a realm of disruption and attempted order that, mirroring the often tense struggles between popular demand and juridical control, may be called an *interior state*."" (3) So his point is that the antebellum interiroity **was not** the reuslt of the subject being ""interpellated"" into a ""unitary subjectivity"" but rather than this interiority was ""overpopulated and--as any large population will be--riven by conflicitng demands and anspirations."" [So the individual was a population??] This reflected he thinks the shifts in North American society in the 18th and early 19th, defined by diversity, colliding ""ideological regimes"" and forms of social association. The divisions of this interirotiy were mirrors of divisions that were in their origin social. (4-5) The development of this interior, he notes, created a site of negotiation ""contradicitions and conflicts"" between the numerous ideologies and modes of association that ""belied the coherence of national or market interests"" (4) and were effectively ""beyond the stat'e power to regulate."" (4) Yet on the other hand the productio n of a social interiror gave rise to ""vigilant and habitual self-managment"" as a ""first step in the ideological production of the modern security state."" (4) This self-management project, on the other hand, he insists was necessarily a failed project because noone believed that the ""divided interiors of the antebellum citizen could be integrated once and for all into an oirderly and unified whole, a pscyhic *e pluribus unum*."" (4) Reference or ""production"" of the unconscious indicated an awareness of forces that would disrupt that project. Yet interiority suggest he says that the goal never was to ""regulate once and for all the unruly interirors of the citizen nor to keep citizens from developing skills of negotation, but to gove thise skills a virtual arena in which to operate..."" (4) That also made this kind of ""democracy"" a mobile enterprise. That is, he says, that interiority made it possible for democracy to break out beyond traditional borders of localities. He describes interiority in a way as a kind of social protection inside the self: ""In a period when citizens traveled with unprecedented frquenecy, the mobile sociality provided by antebellum interiority became a necessary check on disorientation and alienation and, in the process, enabled the state's expansion across national borders without sacrificing the *feel* of a still intact democratic integrity."" (5)&nbsp; So interiority ==&gt; mobility...</p>
<p>2. **Institutionalism**: This was an ideology that arose in response to French and Haitian revoltuions. This was a corollary to interiority that created a ""semblance of permanence"". (5) It claimeed to be capapble of crarrying ""current social interests unhindered into the future."" (5) It ""deferred temporally what interiroity displaced spatially."" (5) That is, by focusing people on a ""perpetually receding horizing of futurity"" , it made the achievmeent of democracy now impossible, and it divided people by their orientation toward teh past (ie the nostalgic, unproductive, and mealancholic) from those oriented twoard the future( the productive and energetic.) (5) So although it focused on the future, it created in practice an ""immobility of de-historicized stasis."" It imagined not a ""better future"" but a future that exactly replicates the present. It credited agencies with agency -- the agency necessary to recereate their existence int he future. Thus it negates the agency of the individual. It produced a view of the individual as ""passionate"" and thus also apolitical -- passionate and therefore dangerous to the order and incapable of constructive political action. It advocates partiality. So while interiority alienated individual from public&nbsp; spaces of social debate, institutinoalism put them in a position wehre they were regulating their ""turbulent interiors"" which in its view of them were also what made them ""unifit for civic participation."" ""Citizens became administartors, in short, of themselves."" (6)</p>

"""The Foundations of All Future Researches"": Franz Boas, George Hunt, Native American Texts, and the Construction of Modernity","p. 503 - 5 Gap Between Acknowledgement of Native Suffering and Collected Texts

In prefaces, Boas described the suffering of the Indian population from racism, poverity, disease, exploitation, violence.  But these problems appear as obstacles to the gathering of texts.  So in the Chinook texts he notes the inability to collect certain texts due to people's suffering. (503)

But Boas never links such comments with certain texts, that might elucidate such problems: ""They relate almost without exception to pre-contact events; the warfare texts are all traditionalized, set at substantial temporal and cultural distance from the present, and there is only a passing reference to a recent epidemic in what is framed as a shamanistic dream narrative.  Boas does not use these texts in linking images of 'authentic' Native American cultures with the scenes that he descrbies so tersely in the prefaces..."" (504)  Warfare stories in general were less interesting to him than ""animal stories, origin myths, tales of supernatural beings, migration legends, accounts of material culture, the life cycle, ritual, religious bliefs, and the like--that is, the more canonical genres of putatively authentic folk expression established by the philological program of Herder and the Grimms.  It was these genres that wer held to reveal the cultural inheritance and hsitory of apeople."" (504)

The authors note on th eother hand that i might have been hard for people to talk about suffering, but the authors note that Boas did not try. (505)

One instance is when Boas records a speech by a chief when the Canadian Gov't was trying to supress certain dances and ceremonies.  And the chief wants to know if Boas has come to help them, in which case he will be not allowed in...  (505)"
"""The Foundations of All Future Researches"": Franz Boas, George Hunt, Native American Texts, and the Construction of Modernity","p. 507 - 511    Further examinations of Boas' approach

- Genre: Boas did not want to distinguish between different types of genre in prim. texts, say historical v. mythical.  They see this as being another strategy for bolstering the authority of the text... (507-8)

- Boas's theory of aesthetics emphasized the unconscious nature of creative production. See Primitive Art (1927), p.155: ""The mental processes of artistic production do not take palce in the full light of consciousness.  The highest type of artistic production is there, and its creator does not know whence it comes."" (Primitiv Art 155, quoted here on 508-9).  Boas the authors say seemed to think that natives could be conscious of art as an object, but not of the process that had led to its creation.(509)  He also did not link art to necessity; it required leisure. (509)  But creation was individual, and the authors cite Boas's quote about an eskimo sitting for hours of a fishing whole, and here having new songs come to mind.  

But on the whole Boas saw instances of creation as rare...diffusion the most common thing.   

Moreover, narratives ""provide an emotional rather than cognitive hold on 'the events of human life,' such that daily experiences are imaginatively transformed through wish fulfillment and the 'materialization of the objects of fear.'"" (509)  

That is, the authors note that if, as they argued earlier, Boas believed stories to reveal a ""picture"" of the way a people saw things, that was not an ""accurate picture"" of a reality: ""...Native American self-consciousness does not 'exhibit clearly' or provide 'an accurate reflection' of everyday life."" (510) To get at this the authors drop two excellent quotes from his Primitive Art that develop the idea further.  Boas's aesthetic theory held that meaning was not consciously given to objects during the act of (individual) creation, but rather narratives gained meaning when they were in circulation, when they were diffused, but the meaning they gained was not an accurate one.  He wrote: ""The narrative is given an interpretive significance that is quite foreign to the original tale..."" (quoted on 510, from Primitivr Art 336-337).

That is native texts are ""simply unrealiable"" the authors say as historical interpretattions.  So they raise the question: ""The tellers simply lack the ability to use narratives in interpreting their own history, in that adventitious meanings, style of interpretation, cultural interests, and symbolic explanations distort conscoiusness of historical events."" (511)  So: ""What sort of authority is then attributed to Native Americans?""  Their answer is that the authority is limited in terms of the ""authority over the <i>reception</i> of these texts"" (511) because the role of anthropologist and the informant are erased...so the statements are still statements of infomrants which are significanct, but they have no control over the way those texts are understood/received."

Age of Fracture,"<p>General Notes Rodgers' Atlantic Crossings</p>
<p>Chapter on Economic Thought<br /><br />* R describes how the old Keynesian theory broke down in he 70s. The stagflation was unusual precisely because it did not fit classical Keysian models, specifically the Phiilips Curve that showed a trade off between inflation and unemployment: high inflation ""buying"" low unemployment. Stagflation defied that rule, which had been based in empirical research. The fjnancial crisis of the 70s then led to a ""crisis in ideas"" and the intellectual authority of the Keynesian system.&nbsp; Rodgers notes that ultimately the Phillips curve returned after the end of the 70s financial crisis with the Reagent tax cuts functioning as stimulus.&nbsp; But nobody knew why it had failed to explain the behavior of the market during the crisis. (47-50)<br /><br />* The crisis of Keynsianism allowed for he rise of monetarism whose greatest exponent was Milton Friedman. R describes his ideas on 50-56. His theory was that the shift in prices was determined solely by ""shifts in the growth rate of the volume of circulating money."" (51) As R puts it, ""[I]n this radically simplified model of aggregate economic behavior, state, society, and institutions all shrank into insignificance within a black box that translated money inputs directly into price outputs."" (51) Not sure why Rodgers does not hit this point but the tradeoff between unemployment and inflation is gone here...and somehow the sense that there is a tradeoff at all. This model was taken up by both the Brits and Americans. The Fed under Volker began advertising money supply targets. But monetarism also failed to be predictive with the relation between money supply and price outputs not behaving as expected.&nbsp; By 1982, the Fed had essentially anandoned the theory and returned to ""discretion and rules of thumb."" (55) While the Fed inverse stated that they had given up applying monetarism, Thatcher's ministers declared that they had given up in 1986. (55)&nbsp; R's judgement in the end is that monetarism ""turned out to be a bulldozer that could level a building but could not erect one. (55) It helped transfer responsibility for management of he business cycle from Congress to the Fed. And the idea of a ""natural"" rate of unemployment that Friedman had pushed helped to destroy dreams of full employment. (55) <br /><br />&nbsp;* The chapter then goes on to describe three shifts that defined the ""struggle over ideas and paradigms"" that formed the new economic body of ideas: 1) the invasion of economic ideas into the legal profession that moved law away from a focus on blame, social justice, etc, and instead toward econoimcally ionspired notions of ""aggregate good"" which involved letting the market do its work, see 56-64; 2) rise of ""rational expectation"" economists in the university, esp. Robert Lucas, whose challenged the idea that any management of the economy was possible at all because economic actors were always anticipating regulation, (something Friedman had suggested vv monetary policy). This created a howl new vision of economic actors as lightning-fast calculators, able to judge economic policy in terms of its teime effects vis-a-vis money, ie how it would influence inflation. (63-68); 3) and then the ""supply-side"" advocates centereda t the Wall Street Journal (Robert Bartley, Jude Wanninski, Jack Kemp, and Irving Kristol) whose arguments did not sell university economists, but who gave fuel to a massive anti-government and anti-tax set of ideas and moved economics popularly completey away from the idea that economics was a science rooted in limits and scarcity, and instead supported the idea of the market as a source of boundless opportunity. 68=73.</p>
<p><br />Chapter on Power<br /><br />This chapter attempts to assess the shifts in analyses of power on both the left and the right since the mid-60s.&nbsp; It's argument, as with the rest of the book, is that there is a ""fracturing"" of awareness, meaning when it comes to power that power is no longer considered in relation to classes and institutions and that through the concept of culture its presence in our lives becomes more pervasive in our lives and more precise in its method of controls.&nbsp; A phrase Rodgers uses regularly is the ""microphysics of power,"" which is incidentally a phrase I also heard Victoria De Grazia use once in describing the ethical focus of her generation of historians.&nbsp; Rodgers puts it this way in tthe intro to the chapter: ""Down some of these winding paths, power fragmented, its bloc categories fracturing into smaller, individually situated micropolitical acts.&nbsp; Down others, power grew more diffuse, pervasive, and subtle.""&nbsp; (79)&nbsp; <br /><br />The most dominant reading of power mid-century, R says,&nbsp; was ""interest-group pluralism"" (81)&nbsp; Idea here was that big organized social interests clashed publically for power.&nbsp; The biggest interests were big business, big labor, and big gov't.&nbsp; But also ""old and entrenched ethnic elites, new immigrant voters and their political machines, regional and sectional interessts, small business owners, agricultural and mining interests, commerical and manufacturing groups..."" (81)&nbsp; This created a ""constantly shifting configuration of organized social and economic intersts."" (81-82). The multiplicity of interests is what made Democracy work, according to Robert Dahl in his 1961 book ""Who Governs?"" So what puralists braggeda bout was not that they had ""disaggregate interest groups or to abolish power"" but that they had set ""power against power, interests against interests, they had constructed a balance of competing and countervailing forces whose very tensions kept the system whole."" (82) <br /><br />This theory of power began to fray in the 60s in the midst of the intensified social conflicts.&nbsp; As more and more people began to feel ""that they were on the losing end of power struggles that had suddenly gone out of control,"" a new theory emerged that focused on ""hidden concentrations of power."" (82)&nbsp; The left focused on a line in Trotskyite Marxism that focused on the ""bureacuratic managerial class taht, wresting power from the owners of money and property, was said now to manage and direct the key institutions of late twentieth-century capitalism."" (82) Also a line of analysis focusing on the ""therapeutic state"" that was parituclarly present in Lasch's Culture of Narcissism. (82)&nbsp; This line of analysiss was embraced by those on the political right!!&nbsp; By Iriving Kristol in his op-ed contributions to the Wall Street Journal; by Robert Bork, who blamed his failed bid fot he Supreme Court on this ""new class."";b ythe conservative sociaoloigist Peter Berger who, echoing the Communist manifesto, spoke in 1978 of ""the spectre of the New Class."" (83)&nbsp; This was a strange shift beecause conservatives had long denied structural class divisions.&nbsp; It was partly a product of leftist intellectual moving right, e.g. the ex-Trotskyite James Burnham who introduced the new class theory into Buckley's National Review.&nbsp; But while it was corporate manager's that had been at the center of the new classs theory originally, conservatives focsued on ""modern societiy's still larger array of knowledge and symoblic workers: professionals, educators, cultural produceers, and technocrats."" (83)&nbsp; These people the analysis went ""found its interests in the big and growing state."" (84)&nbsp; Throught eh state they attempted, as Kristol put it, ""to supersede economics by politics"" (84)&nbsp; This was a stripped-down versin of Marx that ""gave voice to an intuitive sense, running below conserative talk of the primacy of ideas, of the determinvative effects of social postiion and of economic interests."" (85)&nbsp; It helped explain the radical politics of them explain the rise of radical politics amoung well-educated 60s youth, as well as the power of th eliberal voice in the universities and in the media.&nbsp; And it introduced a new notion of class interest into the right's rhetoric.&nbsp; <br /><br />A second analysis of power on the right emerged from game theory and rational choice.&nbsp; (85-90)&nbsp; If the new class theory introduced a langauge of power into right rhetoric, this line of thought fractured the right's conception of power.&nbsp; ""Dispensing with aggregates, it bore down on the dynamics of self-interested individual political action, remapping the world of politics and legislative action as a filed of individual preference-satisfying behavior."" (85) thinkers like Wiliam Riker, james Buchanan, Mancur Olson, applied game theory and rational choice to political actors, depicting them as always trying to maximize personal power and benefits.&nbsp; The conservative strain here came from the pessimistic reading of the results, R says, (86)&nbsp; All the models--""the prisoner's dilemma, Olson's free-rider problem, Garrett Hardin's tragedy of he commons, where existence of af ree resource meant that no had a stakke in prevening that resource from being exhausted"" (86)--""yielded, by their implacable logic, suboptimal results."" (86) And thus under the weight of these analyses Rodgers says ""the idea of governance as an experession of the public good all but evaporated."" (87)&nbsp; ""'New Class' theory gave conservatives a structural expalantion for why they felt so marginalized in the early 1970s.&nbsp; In the application of interest-maximizing individual behavior to politics, by constrast, the aggregates did not clash, as they had for Berger and Kristol, but fractured out into myriad individual pieces."" (87)&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />A key part of Rodger's argument is that the move toward ""subtler and more insidious understandings of power"" (106), in which power is everywhere and nowhere, impossible to locate, comes from all sides, from the left and the right, and from different even ostensibly&nbsp; opposed lines of thought.&nbsp; <br /><br />On the left, the concept of culture was central and R analyzses the terms development from 94, which as he discusses it emerged out of the new labor history, spawned by Thompson, which had already fractured around its detailed examination of the different lines of resistance in workding class communities.&nbsp; Into this study, culture emerged as something other than ""ideologies, or superstrcutures of ideas (as orthodox Marxists had thought of them)""; it was ""more malleable, pervasive, elusive, and yet paradoxically, power-saturated."" (94)&nbsp; But if culture could be seen as a source of power from the bottom up, it could also be seen as the reverse, and that's how it came to be seen by those who adopted Antmnio Gramsci's notion of hegemony.&nbsp; R also contrasts Thompson's work with Genovese's Roll, Jordan, Roll, as a book that focused on cutlure but as a source of domination.&nbsp; (96-97). <br /><br />As the focus on culture expanded, it invaded language itself.&nbsp; Pocock's analysis treated ""'languages' as ideologically charged systems of meaning."" (98)&nbsp; British labor historians began to see language not as a ""transparent register of social experience but a thing of structure and power in its own right.&nbsp; Language 'is an independent non-referential system,' Gareth Stedman Jones was writing by 1980. It 'set[s] the limits of what can be thought or apprehended at a given time."" (98) Then in cultural theory ther was a turn toward ""lingusitic structuralism"" driven by Geertz, who had begun his career working with modernization theory.&nbsp; In the mid-60s he moved away from the social scientific language of structure and development toward the ethnographic practice and anthropology's ""litearry threads."" (99)&nbsp; Geertz's new prose was more modest R notes when compared to the ""imperial pose of the structuralist social sciences..."" (99)&nbsp; ""Cutting culture down to size, the Geertzian move was to take an event, a recurrent ritual, like the betting play at a Balinese cockfight that his mose widely read essay made famous, and, weaving reportage and academic concepts so artfully into 'thick description' of the even-as-text that they could not be pried apart, 'draw large conclusions from small but very densely textured facts.'"" (99) <br /><br />R notes that this form of analysis ""brushed by"" readings of societies as ""system of produciton and exchange, systems of authority and behavior rules, systems of social differentiation and inequality, structures of cosmic belief and ideology..."" (99)&nbsp; There were, R says, ""no structural foundatinos in Geertz's system: nothing but a play of texts, meanings, and semiotics all the way down."" (100) This mode of interpretation became very powerful inthe 1980s and weakenedd th structural social history of the past.&nbsp; It was a turn away from institutinos and structures, a ""thinning of the social"" as William Sewall called it.&nbsp; (100)&nbsp; What fueled this turn R thinks was a generation taht ""had grown up in the wake of th media revolution of the post-World War II era, in a sea of texts and meanings, amid a symbolic bombardment that was now part and parcel even of politics,"" and for such people the notion that ""culture floated insubstantially on top of more basic structures of economic or demographic power made less and less intuitive sense.&nbsp; Power lay in meanings, in the very ability of cultural form to give shape to the welter of experience, to spin reality into its forms."" (101)&nbsp; When Geertz took a look at power in the 1970s ""it was to virtually dissolve the distinction between power and thought."" (101) Geertz looked at it in ihs sutdy of precolonial Bali, depeicing a society ""saturated with power relations."" (101)&nbsp; Specifically he looked at it in his study of Negara.&nbsp; (101) Power in his analyssis resisded in ""meaning istelf, in the very tremulous stuff of culture."" (102)&nbsp; And this was a new conception fo pwoer on the left.<br /><br />Next R looks at Foucault's analysis of power.&nbsp; F didn't talk about cutlure, wasn't in his vocabulary, but he did the same thing with it.&nbsp; At its starts it was in institutions, but by his later writing ""power had seeped out of the sites and structures until it was everywhere."" (104) Geertz objected to Foucautl's pessimism, ""to the way in which each moment of apparent progress led only to new forms of unfreedom, like stairways in an Escheer drawing that folded back upon themselves.""&nbsp; (104) For R, though, Foucault and Geertz might ahve bene opposed, their ""dematerialization"" of power was similar.&nbsp; ""'Culture' was not in Foucault's vocabulary; power was to be found not in consciousness or ideology, he instisteed, but in tactics and strategy.&nbsp; But in their rejection of structures, their disaggregation of power, their stress on the power/knowledge juncture, Foucauldian readings of power entered a field already primed to receive them...."" (107) <br /><br />A very good passage here suming up and critiquing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Power had moved decisively into the spheres of culture, ideas, everyday practices, science.&nbsp; But if power relations were everywhere and saturated everything, not only investing in individual subjects but producing them, if power were indistinguishable from resistance, incapable of being held by any identifiable group or institution, unlinked in any sense to 'agency,' had not the long, complex search for power's ever more subtle faces succeeded, at last, in finding nothing at all?"" (107) <br /><br />## Chapter 6 -&nbsp; Race and Social Memory</p>
<p>* This chapter begins two that show the fragmenting of concepts and categories that had undergirded identity up until the 1970s. By the end of the chapter on race, the concept of ""race"" that Gunnar Myrdal had in his key 1940s book <em>An American Dilemma</em> described as a ""social and conventional"" category was being treated as something ""unstable"" and ""decentered"" by Omi and Howard Winant, see p.137 for the juxtaposition. As Rodgers puts it, ""the terms in which justice and race were eing overly deated [for instance in the afifmrative action debate] had shifted from the historical and social condsiderations of the early 19870s to a new, more abstract terrain."" (136) And ultimately, Rodgers tihnks that this new sense of multiplicity and hybridity in identity risked makign race seem unreal. He quotes Gates on 142 warning fo this: ""Race was 'a text (an array of discursive practices), not an essence,' a braid of memory made no in 'blood' but in history and in culture. Gates cautioned against 'the treachersous non sequitur that mous us from 'socially constructured' to essentially unreal.' In acknowledging, that '<em>everything</em>' is socially constructured,' we should not 'rol up hsitory behind us like a carpet.'"" (142).&nbsp; But this is what Rodgers thinks occurred. He ends the chapter: ""'Identities are the names we give to the different ways we are positioned by, and position ourselve in, the narratives of the past,' Stuart Hall wrote. but from <em>Roots</em>' vividly imagined brad of memory and racial solidarity in the 190s, the growth of more complex understanidngs of identity was also the retreat of history. A culture reshaped in the choices oand present moment preoccupations of a market saturated society had transposed the frame of teh argument. In a liberation that was also the age's defecit, a certain loss of memory had occured."" (143)</p>
<p>* In this chapter, as in the others, Rodgers tries to show how this general trend happened from multiple political directions. Blacks' own narratives shifted to undermine the starting point in which race was a clear and obvious factor in opression and then also a source of pride. So he traces a line from Alex Haley's <em>Roots, </em>James Baldwin's sense of the&nbsp; ""iron curtain"" of race (112), Toni MOrrison's sense of the special sound and feeling of black experience (116-117) to William Julis Wilson's controversial 1978 book <em>The Declining Sifnificance of Race</em>.(113-125). 2) Then he shows the rising awareness of race for whites and reverse racism and the conservative attack on affirmative action that emphasized the ideal of ""color blindness."" (125-137). Then he traces the undermining of race in ""progressive African-Ameriacn intellectuals"" -- the undermining of the ocncept's ""ontological status."" (137-142</p>
<p>## Chapter 7 - Gender and Certainty</p>
<p>* This chapter takes up debates about the identities of men and women that Rodgers thinks were the most important battles fought out in what James Davison Hunter in 1991 termed the ""culture wars"" in his book byt hat title. (145). Essentially it builds on the trend that he finds in his chapter on race, but cuts at identity ostensibly on a much deeper level, where again he finds that there is as the battles develop, a complete emptying out of any certainties about gendered identity -- and this is both the result of how feminism develops once it moves into the university, where taking up French poststructuralist theory, it treats gender identity as primarily discourses, and then how the debate about idnetity is fought out between conservatives and feminists. The latter debates could confirm the poststructuralist feminists' claims about the deep linguistic binaries that undergirded language. Rodgers writes after analyzing Allan Bloom's <em>The Closing of the American Mind</em> and its spin offs, ie William Benne's De-Valuing America, Gertrude Hemmelfarb's Demoralization of Society, Lynne Cheney's Telling th e Turth and Michael Novak's Awakening from Nihilism, all fo which posed a trade-off between certainties and an abyss of realtivism and choice:</p>
<p>&gt; ""Leave the gruond of moral reasning where things were fixed in nature for a world of choices, contexts, and competing perspectives, the argument went [in these books], and all that was left was the play of power and identity politics. If poststructuralist claims about the deep binaries seated in language needed confirmation, they might have found it here. To stake one's claims in certainties was to frame the alternative as an abyss of nothingness. Encounter with truth, on the one hand: the qucksands of realtivsim on the other."" (177)</p>
<p>On the opposite side and the target for Bloom was Rorty,who stood accused for being ""the man who killed truth"" as the BBC put it (177). But Rorty was not in fact an amoralist; rather in his view ""the hard work of ethical life was done not in the abstract but in the concrete and the particular: in arguemtns over wages and health care, he wrote, not indebates about the commodification of labor or the underlying nature of 'man.'"" (177) Rorty wrote: ""Solidarity has to be constructed out of the litle pieces, rather than found already waiting, in the form of an ur-language which all of us recognize when we hear it."" (177) So Roders concludes here that identity had now become radically unstable even at the most basic (male/female level). After a quote by Jodi Dean that gets at this he writes: ""All these identity were set in prescripted discourses and fragmented subject positions. They were, simultaneously, open and unstable, multiple, disruptive. {para} Every solidarity, the period showed, was open to fissuring."" (178) Interestingly he ends the chaper sugggesting taht this jostling and desconstructing about identity ""had not felt like facture. It had felt like war."" (179). It seems he means when all certainties are borken? and this is reference to the ""cutlure wars.""</p>
<p>* There is a certain tone of condecension towards the feminists her I think, and an unwillingness to consider the positive possibilities of their deconstructions. Did their critqiues only fracture and fragment and create a stark division between relativistic chaos and stark certainties? Is that all that these ideas can do? When he describes why the feminists now in the academy turned to poststructuralist thought on 162 he sounds condescending to me. ""The langauag eof 'theory' gave women newly entering th graduate schools and literature departments an intellectual claim [as if without theory they would not have had oen?], a language of textual virtuosity, a voice that could not be dismissed as closeted in the identity politics of a women's studies program."" Some truth here, but mixed with a certain sense that the dieas were only important to these women because of their ability to grant power! ""Above all, iin its pessimism, poststructuralism offered a new kind of power--not to speak as women (and in the process reinforce the very categories of women's suboridnation) but to destabilize the ways in which 'female was submerged, made marginal to, and always under the domination of 'male.'"" (162)</p>
<p>* Also very useful in this chapter is the description of poststructuralism and the distinction between poststructruralism and postmodernism (often seen as the same thing) on 156-158.</p>
<p>&gt; 'Postmodernism, 'with which poststructuralism was sometimes conflated, was an understanding of contemporary culture that stressed its decentered, fragmentary, surface-obsessed, patchwork character. In the hands of critics like Frederic Jameson, postmodernism was a Schumpeterian reading of culture, in wihch the market forces of commodification and creative destruction left nothing, even identity, stable. Poststructuralism began from the opposite premise: the extraordinary capacity of lanague to disguise and control the radical isntability at language's heart. Poststructuralism offered not a theory about language's already existing order, but in Joan W. Scott's words, 'a theory about how categories are constructed to apepar closed or fixed when they are not.'"" (158).</p>
<p><br />## Chapter 8 - Little Platoons of Society<br /><br />* After two chapters, examining the large shifts in identity politics in the realms of race and then sexuality -- where there is a move away from simple models, in which race or sex is interpreted in realtion to large social structures and institutions (class, or paternity, or slavery...)&nbsp; This chapter looks at what kinds of discourses on society did emerge.&nbsp; It is complex, but the big point is that there were still a lot of discussions of society.&nbsp; The Thatcher comment did not represent her thinking or the thinking of the period on any side of the debate.&nbsp; ""Society had not disappeared from the general stock of concepts and desires.&nbsp; But like other concepts of the age it had grown thinner and more fragmented as older meanings fell out of it.&nbsp; Rawls's assumption that to think about justice was to begin by imagining what each owed to all across the moral community of the nation had the air of an antique piece.&nbsp; The idea of equality had lots its urgency.&nbsp; What society conjured up now was something smaller, more voluntaristic, fractured, easier to exist, and more guarded from others."" (220)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* The last quarter of the 20th century was a ""renascent era for political thoery."" Mid-century was dominated by sociology and social psychology and by a focus on ""the production of social roles and personality and the relentless pressures of mass conformity."" (182). Rawls text was the key new work, and he analyzes it on 182-185. Key point here is that Rawls argument was 100% grounded in the ""analytical vocabulary of economics and raitonal choice."" (183) -- the intellectual trends that had stirpped economics of its focus on history, structure, and scarcity and moved the focus onto the lighting-fast calculator of rational expectation economics etc. So rawls' vision was itself thin and offered no""overarchind idea of th epublic good beyodn the interests of his imagined social contractors"" who would support a welfare state because they never knew if they would need the aid of redistributionist policies if born disadvantaged. But it was still to much and ultimately it was critiqued by both the left and the right. His social contract idea which Rodgers says was still ""forged in a sense of mutla obligation of each to all"" was repalced by ""smaller, more inttimate, but also more partial understandings of society."" (185)</p>
<p>* The sources were mutliple as usual. There was ont he one hand critiques that emphasized stronger social bonds; he mames E.o. Wilson's On Human Nature (ie sociobiological arguments) and the ""liberation theology"" that came from South American left Marxism and infused the Catholic Lef int he US culiminating in the pastoral letter on the conomy <em>Economic Justice for All</em> that the American Catholic Bishops put forth in 1986. (185-186).</p>
<p>* Another main strain was the liberatrian politics. He uses robert Nozick's <em>Anarachy, STate and Utopia</em> as the key text. Nozick's ideas had partly came out of a course ""Capitalism and Socialism"" that Walzer and Nozick presented in 1971 at Harvard and wich became a kind of ""verbal duel."" (187) Nozick rejedcts Rawls' image of obligation and society; he rejects the ""very effort to imagine the pattern of justice in advance."" (187) The book ""dazzkled"" Rodgers said because of ""the radical thinness"" to which Nozick cut down Rawls' obligations. It presented an image of a society without a state, with a ""multitude of different , paraellel communites, waxing and waning as individuals joined and left..."" (188) Libertarians were not always accepted by the conservatives, but both libertarians and conservatives agreed that ""equality was a faltal ambition for a just society."": ( 189) Key to Nozicke's argument hhowever was the idea that if a society started out as just (if the distribution of resources was just) then the historical processes that developed and cahnged that society could not bring the society to a point of being unjust. (see 188) Rodgers&nbsp; notes taht Nozick considered ina&nbsp; footnote scnarios in which the ""original shares of social goods were not just"" in which case the further developnment of thes coiety could not wash away the taint, but Noziick left the line of thinking and analysis. Nozick was not interested in analyzing the issue of rectification, so he left it wiuthot answer. (190-191).</p>
<p>*Another source was the new empahsis on ""more intesnely bound communities"" and this was not a conservative lline! This form of thinking took multiple forms: ""civic republicanism, communitarianism, the new citizenship, the civil society movement, the revival of civic virtue."" (191) First it came out of the 1960s left wehre it developed from the ""direct-action political communities"" of African-American acitivites, in the ""cooperatives, cauccauses, affinity groups, community organizing projects, and consciousness-raising meetings..."" and so on. Civic republicanism tried to find an atlernative commitment to 'self-denying civic virtue"" in the Revolutionary era, ie a line that ran counter to Madison's Federalist No. 10. (192). Robert Bellah traced these two competing langauges in a must-read book of the 1980s, <em>Habits of the Heart</em>. bBut most important book on this was Michael Walzter's <em>Spheres of Justice</em>, which was also born out of the course that he and Nozick had given and a critqiue fo Rawls. Walzer thought Rawals project wrong because it imagined that ""justice ccould be formulated outside the particular community and particualr relationships within wihch people actually lived."" (193) Walzer offered a defnse of the welfare state in his work, but Rodgers insisties that that defense was ""less prominent than his desire to demassify it, open it up for more active forms of assocaitional and communcal participation, to bring it closer to the grtuond of real, pluralistic civic life."" (194) By implication the welfare state could only be savied by ""bringing [it]...ito more vital connection with the real moral community of actual social life..."" (194) Hence here is a more intimate, samller and more fragmented vision of society coming from the progressive left.</p>
<p>* Conservastives were at first warry of civic republicanism and communitarianism. They did nto like the historical claim seeking to locate an itellectual tradition runnign counter to the revoluationary elite. (194), but utliamtely they found reasons to pick up some of the ideas. Peter Berger and Ricahrd Jone Neuhaus at the American Enterprise Institute tried in their ""mediating structures project."" (195) Another sign of appropriation o fthese ideas on the conservatives ide was the use of the term ""virtue"" by conservatives. For civic republicanism the ideas was sacrifice of the self for the public weal. fFor conservatives it became a reference to ""ethical certainty"" a slogan to jsutify ""harder-edged moal"" in schools,a counter to soft relatvism. (196) Simiarlly, the resistance movements that sprang up in Central and EAstern Europe provoked the emergence of the ""new citizenship project"" at the Bradley Foundation, supported by Micahel Joyce. This reimagined citizenship as working on smaller levels and in ""civil society"": ie in churches and daycare centers, and charity and homeless centers etc. It assumed that the ""national community idea"", as William A. Schambra put it, was a ""dead end."" The natijonal community these conservatives argued was jsut a ""Trojan horse for the intrusion of the invasive therapeutic state."" (197) Real community was ""local,small-scale and participational."" (197) Conservatives her picked up Edmund Burke's phrase the ""little platoons"" of society. Burke had meant that from these smaller sites of obligation grows the national patriotism. Now the conservatives clipped off the last part. (197)&nbsp;</p>
<p>## ""Wrinkles in Time""</p>
<p>* The idea here is that a new sense of historical time emerged in this era of fracture: ""As the very language for society threatened to break into fragments, the past became a sphere onto which desires for community and cohesion could be projected. A truly changeless society would have no need to dwell on its history,. In contrast, a sense of living within a fragmenting and accelerating time made history a point of acute importance."" (221) Looking at the willingness of Reagan's speechwriters to evoke a ""celluloid film of American hsitory"" in which as Reagan put it at the Rededication of teh Stateue of Liberty in 1986 a ""common thread that binds"" everything led to a notino of history as an ""unborkenline of reassurance."" (222) Here Rodgers says history did not ""unfold step by step, organizing the chaotic patterns of causation and change, explaining the past's continuous, irreversible pressure on the present. In this atlernative vein, the boundary between past and present virtually dissovled. History's massive social processes disappeared. One traveled between past, present, and futrue in the momentary blink of the imagination, through a wrinkle in time."" (222-223)</p>
<p>* He finds one indicating of a sense of compressed and accelerated time in Alvin Toffler's Future Shock (1970) and then in his Third Wave (1980). In the former there was a ""radical compression"" of time; int he second ""history's processes crashed into one another in a perfect storm of simultaneity."" (224) These boks were best sellers. (224) Legal conservatives in another example ""who had once defended continuity and traition, began to argue that the courts hsould vault ofer history inone umpe, back to the orgiianl meaning of the Constitution."" (224) In post-soviet world, experts and managers believed that the shfit to market economies could happen simultaneosuly rather than ""within hsitorica time."" (224)</p>
<p>* He refers to the study of history in this period, which after a period of consensus hsitory at mid-century (driven in part by the closed immigratino), had by the time of the 1976 Bicententiall of American Indepdnecen fragmented. The question&nbsp; was how to provide a unified story and inthe end this did not work so well. (226-229)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* In this context he brings up the Reagan speechwriter's ""drilling through the messiness of hsitory through a wrinkle in time..."" (229). But it was not just a speechwriter's trick he says:</p>
<p>* One sourcew as the ""aesthetics of postmodernism."" (230) in architechture and art. This style used pastiche and juxtaposition. (230) ""Everything fractured in postmodern aesthetics"" Roddgers says.</p>
<p>* Another source was the new ""originalism"" interpretation of the constitution. Rodgers gives an account of it from 232-242. He emphasizes that the idea had echose but no systematic paraellels before it emerged out of a radical arguement on the fringe.&nbsp; He cites a case that was the work of Raoul Berger, a law proefssor and self-trained hijstorian, who had written about the history fo the 14th ammendment in which he rejected Brown based on the idea o the intention of the framers. Berger's arguemtns captured support in conservative circles and led utlimately to a couple of decisions <em>Jaffe </em>and <em>Smith</em> that use the ideas. These decdision were overruled but REhnquist in the process while not accepting the argument made in these cases made a similar arguemnt based on intent, throwing out the ""Wall of separatino"" idea that had been the basis of church-state seapration ideas since the 1940s, and had been taken from a Jefferson letter.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rodgers thinks it ""brought a tangle of trheads to the surface: the vulnerability of the Warren Court's vneutres into new realms of rights declaration; the multiple, rival American hsitories in circulatino; the countermobilization of expertise which the conservative foundations were now able to bring to bear against the legal and edcuational estabilshments; and the sectional revialries running so strongly through politics."" (236) Regan's new attorny general in ? then in this context said the administration would support ""jurisprudcent of original intention."" (237) Robert Borkthen becomes a key exponent of this controversial view. (Which Ackerman complicates in his 1991 We The People saying that there may have been multiple originary moments.) (239)&nbsp; Rodgers ums up saying that ""originalism was a project for breaking the law's continuity..."" (240) It was based not in a ""desire to go back ot any actual past but a desire to esscape altoghether from time's sliperiness--to locate a trap door thorugh which one could reach beyond history and find a simpler place outside of it."" (241) This died downin the 1990s he says but for ""over a decade, the idea of penetrating time, folding history over upon itself so that one could slip out of its complexities, had been a powerful intellectual project."" (241)</p>
<p>* Next section focuses on the ""End of History"" argument of Fukuyama that were brought about by the end of the Soviet Union. The idea of the Soviety Union of the Cold War was that Communism was incapapble of change; that was ""axiomatic"" Rodgers says. (242-244). Therefore the SU would just be washed away, so the perestoika was perceived not as real reform by conservative itnerpreters; it was seen assomething engineered to fool the west by the Kremlinm. (245). Here&nbsp; Fukuyama's article appeared in 1989 heralding an ""end of history"" -- which in Rdoger accounts invovles a sudden ""lurch"" or ""leap"" into a post historical stage. This, he tihnks, fits with his wrinkle in time idea -- but I think there is somethign mroe going on here. Fukuyama's ""endism"" was hyped partly because it ""followed on th heels"" in the media of Paul Kennedy's ""declinism"" about America's imperial overreach. (246) Rodgers ays it ""tapped with extraordinary force the otions of folded and short-circuited time that ran through late-twentieth-century social thought. It promised a great leap forward across institutions and inertia into a 'universal homogenous state' of markets, property, science, personal liberties, and democracy."" (247)</p>
<p>* Then Rodgers has a section on those who planned the ""transition"" in Eastern Europe. Again here he finds a historical vision of change which is really predicated on a drilling thruoght time. Jeffrey Sachs a ckey player. Rodgers uses the wrod ""vaulting"" to describe the vision. (247-254).</p>
<p>* Then in the conclusion he does something funny I think, seeming to embed the new sense of time in the market ideology that he described emerging out of the ""Rediscovery of the Market."" He says ""the new model sof time and change reflected a widespread sense of the naturalness of the market--not merely their utility, or their astonishing capacity for productivity and innovation, but their very congruence with human nature itself."" (254) I see why he's tying this back in, but he seems to subordinate the time issue ot the market ideology too much for my taste, and in any case he needs to explain the link more carefully. This is important! Does the market really create this sense of time? If so, how? Or does the sense of time reinforce the market ideology? -- which I might be more inclined to believe.</p>"

Striking highlighted text on p. 34 reads: ""The crescent-shaped Islamic bloc, from the bulge of Africa to central Asia, has bloody borders."" 

But he also defines an interesting separation on p.30 within Europe, a linethat reaches fromthe border of Russia and Finalnd almost straight downwardto the middle of Romania, where it takes a sharp turn West cutting Croation and SErbia in two and then turns South again into Albania.  The division line here is on the West ""Western Christianity circa 1500"" and the east Orthodox Christianity and Islam"".  This two is a bloody border, e.g. the conflit in the Balkans. (30)"

"Sociology and Scientism: The American Quest for Objectivity, 1880-1940","<p>Bannister Notes<br /><br />Intro<br /><br />- 1920s saw objectivity get new life. The idea had originally come from Comte and had been important at sociology's founding in the 1880s. But now objectivity was more specific: would only study the ""observable externals of human behavior, thus carrying to a logical extension the strict inductionism of sensationalist psychology."" (3). This meant no more recording ""feelings, interests, or wishes"" that had been common among prewar sociologists. (3). B notes that ontologically this rested on a distinction between objects that were ""accessible"" and about which knowledge could be had and objects that were not. (3). Epistemologically it rested on experience as a keuy basis for knowlege. (3). It relied upon Lrigorous methods"" and although this involved discussion od the case stufy, participant observation, and comparative method, statistics became most common. Above all, it equated objectivity with total neutrality. (3)<br /><br />- Two versions of ""objectivism"": nominalist (Ogburn, Chapin) and realist (Luther Bernard). Nominalists see ""society as the name for the collective responses of individuals"" and so they thought sociology could simply statistically measure and tabulate ""environmental change and...responses to change."" (6). Social class then was simply a set of preferences for home funishings in one of Chapin's studies. For the realists the emphasis was on providing an ""objective standard of social control"" and so clear standards for social reconstruction. Bannister says these represent the two main components of Comtean thought: the passion for quantification as a path to ""positive"" knowledge and the Comte's ""utopian"" program.

A Social History of Anthropology in the United States,"p.007-8  Anthropology in US serving needs of new nation

Patterson frames the purpose of anthropology in the early republic in relation to the needs of the new nation in defending itself against the claims of Europeans like Georges Louis Leclerc and comte de Buffon who ""asserted the inferiority of the New World, its inhabitants and their societies.""  Benjamin Franklin, James Madison, Thomas Jefferson all attepted to refute Buffon and those wh o follwed his arguments.  Buffon text was his 1749 <i>Natural History</i>.  The critics of Buffon in the US were affiliated with the American Philosophical Society that had been founded in 1743.  (8)  

What rational develops?  Rejecting Bufon's argumeent that the ""New World"" and its inhabitants inferior in ""nature"", Jefferson for eample in <i>Notes on the State of Virgina</i> argues that ""nature"" was the same in both places.  Paterson says he puts forward a theory of nature like that of the ""Enlightenment writers"" (9)  Humans themselves the same, differences form as resutl of environment and civlizational ""stage"" reached."
Voelkerpscyhologie and German-Jewish Emancipation,"<p>Notes 5/2013</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read this article quickly, may reread. My brief summary is that Bunzl is here trying to show the centrality of German-Jewish emancipation themes to the way in which Lazarus and Steinthal formulated the discipline -- the two of them being key originators of the science. Previous examinations of the origins of the science have totally ignored the importance of emancipation (49-50). The analysis of the experience of emancipation by German-Jews is useful, see 60-68. Between 68-78, Bunzl shows how the politics of emancipation and interpretation of the Jewish ""Geist"" entered into Lazarus and Steinthal's formulation of the discipline. Then finally, the discipline does not take off. It's formulation is somehow outmoded when compared to the more sophisticated forms of cultural analysis established by the Berlin cultural scientists, Bastian, etc. But then also Bastian does not believe that languages are a reliable source of cultural analysis (78-79. It's Boas that carries it on to some extent -- and indeed he uses the phrase genius of a poeple -- and he has contacts with Steinthal and his student Benno Erdmann. (82) But also Boas' work ""resembled"" that of Lazarus and Steinthal in that he discounted race and focused on pscyhologicalan d historical processes, on ""languag,e mythology, and art..."" (82) And Boas' ""overarching universalism..."" (83) -- But thi spoint is not well worked out by Bunzl! He relies on Cole, Liss, Stocking, etc...&nbsp; Then finally, on the last few pages he says Boas was not really like Lazarus and STeinthal in o ne key respect, that they did not take relativism seriously. (84-85).</p>
<p>The problem with this artilcle is similar to what I've noticed at other times in Bunzl. There's too much emphasis on rooting the Boasian line in a hermeneutic tradition in Germany, i.e. in th eline that extends from Herder to Humboldt (both of them) to the liberal anthropologists Bastian, etc, and in this case Lazarus and Steinthal, and then to Boas -- he being the missing link to the present that was necessary because German anthroplogy took the turn to the likes of Ratzel, Graebbner et al... i..e the Sonderweg.&nbsp; It's relevant also that even though Lazarus and STeinthal are linked in here, that Bunzl makes it lcear that he's not challening that basic lineaage that goes through Bastian, Virchow, and the liberal anthropologists,, see fn# 120. What he suggests ther eimportantly is that the Lazarus and Steinthal link is just another node, and itmay be significant vv the four-field construction of Boasian science, i.e. he thinks that perhaps ""Boas's four-field vision fused the ghree fields of Bastian and Cichow's scientific design with the humanist field pioneered by Lazarus and Steinthal...""

Anthropology and Politics in Studies of Naitonal Character,"00 Summary 00

An examination of the origins of treating the ""nation"" as a unit of cultural analysis is the work on national character of Mead, Benedict, Geoffrey Gorer, tec.  Analyzes this in relation to contempoary debates about the nation in anthropology."
A category of the human mind: the notion of person; the notion of self,"p. 18 - 19    Person as ""moral fact""

He thinks the Stoics helped develop the conception of the self into a moral idea.   their ""volutnarist and perosnal ethics were able to enrich the Roman notion of the 'person'..."" (18) 

He cites a greek work that has same meaning as persona and says rrom 2nd Century B.C. that it came even more to mean something like character than or true face than it did mask, the ""innermost nature of this 'person'.""  (18) But the word could also could indicate in other contexts the artificial or the ""role-player""   So in his notaiton personnage is the role player, the authentic is person or personne.  (18) 

But latin and greek moralists betwee 200 -- 400 a.d. do something.  Referring to the greek work again he says ""is no longer only a <i>persona</i>...to its juridical meaning is moreover aded a moral one, a sense of being conscious, independent, autonomous, free and responsible.  Moral conscience introduces consciousness into the juridical conception of  law."" (18) Mauss refer to Le Progres de la Conscience by M. Brunschvicg.  The end i s that ""self-consciousness (conscience de soi) has become the attribute of the moral person."" (19)"
"Creating a Female Dominion in American Reform, 1890-1935","0 p.xii ""Female Dominion""

She wants to explain the ""continuity [in white female reform efforts] by identifying an interlocking set of organizations and agencies that I have chosen to call a female dominion in the mostly male empire of policymaking."" (xii)  Their territory of control was child welfare policy.  The important organizations were the Children's Bureau of the Dept. of Labor (creatd in 1912).  Women from this bureau went on to form state agencies that worked in concern with voluntary female organizations.  Educational branch was the School of Social Service Administration at U Chicago.  whihc trained women ""specifically for the dominion's work."" (xii) And the Women's Join Congressional Committee which Muncy calls the ""lobbying auxliaiary"" and which ""offered critical support with federal legislation..."" (xii)  

Finall it is important to note that she says ""[b]y using the metaphor of dominion, I want to evoke a combination of autonomy and circumscription."" (xiii)

The Will to Believe,"<p>General Notes</p>
<p>* The essay he delcares at the outset will be a ""essay in justification of faith, a defence of our right to adopt a believing attitude in religious matters, in spite of the fact that or merely logical intellect may not have been coerced."" (69) He notes that he has always defended this to his students who have always maintained he was wrong.</p>
<p>* First he lays out a distinction between live and dead hypohteses: ""just as electrecians speak of live and dead wires, let us speak of any hypothesis as either <em>live</em> or <em>dead</em>."" (70)&nbsp; What he means is that there are certain choices that people face with regards to belief that are not actually choices because one side of the belief involves a choice that is essentially ""dead"" for them because makes no appeal to their belief.&nbsp; A hypothesis is alive if it is ""among the mind's possibilities."" (70)&nbsp; Then based on this he defines three types of choices: 1) living or dead, 2) forced or avoidable, and 3) momenutous or trivial.&nbsp; (70-71)</p>
<p>* Then he wants to consider the ""actual psychology of human opinion."" (71)&nbsp; Brings up Pascale's wager and notes that it seems silly or even vile--he quotes several people (Clough, Huxley, and Clifford) to the point that it is wrong to, in the words of Clifford, ""to believe anything upon insufficient evidence."" (74) But he differs.&nbsp; What we believe is not determined by logic or reason, he says, says it again on 76 last paragraph.&nbsp; The only things, he says, that we are uncapable of believing are dead hypotheses.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is only our already dead hypotheses that our willing nature is unable to bring to life again. (74-75)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What made a certain hypothesis dead he says was some ""previous action of our willing nature of an antagonistic kind.""&nbsp; (75)&nbsp; By willing nature, though, he does not only mean ""deliberate volition"" but also ""all such factors of belief as fear and hope, prejudice and passion, imitation and partisanship, the cirucmpressure of our caste and set."" (75)&nbsp; (ie ""culture"" ??)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* As a sub point he states the principel that ""as a rule we disbleieve all facts and theories for which we have no use."" (76)&nbsp; He gives as an example the tendency of scientists (he uses scare quotes) to refuse to investigate telepathy. Elsewhere a bit later he pionts out that the whole theory of rational knowledge that the subject has of the object, the idea of ""objective evidence"" which he attributes to the scholastics is something that modern believers in ""objective evidence"" don't actually take part in--they simply ""believe"" in objective evidence and on the flip side, ""They believe so completely in an anti-Christian order of the universe that there is no living option: Christianity is a dead hypothesis from the start."" (79)</p>
<p>* Having explained this pscyhology of belief/opinion he then says that it ought not be seen as a pathological or reprehnsible situation; rather it is ""a normal element in making up our minds."" (77)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* He lays out his thesis: ""Our passional nature not only lawfully may, but must, decide an option between propositions, whenever it is a geniuine opion that cnanot by its nature be decided on intellectual grounds; for to say, under such circumstances, 'Do not decide, but leave the question open,' is itself a passional decision,--just like deciding yes or no,--and is attended with the same risk of losing the truth."" (77)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Key part of the essay: that there are certain opinions where it's not possible and indeed it is inevitable that they'll be decided by our ""passional nature."" (84).&nbsp; James put's it this way: ""I have said, and now repeat it, that not only as a matter of fact do we find our passional nature influencing us in our opinions,but that there are some options between opinions in which this influence must be regarded both as an inevitable and as a lawful determinant of our choice."" (84)&nbsp; On 85 he puts this a bit differently in terms of time, ie are there certain ""forced options"" in our speculation and can we in these ases ""always wait with impunity till the coercive evidence shall have arrived?"" (85)</p>
<p>* Moral Questions are one such instance in our speculative life he insisits.&nbsp; He goes through this on 86-87.&nbsp; ""The question of having moral beliefs at all or not having them is decided by our will."" (86)&nbsp; This is true also in personal relations, such as friendship.&nbsp; One cannot way for proof that someone is trustwrothy or that they like you...it's a matter of the ""heart"" or a ""desire for a certain kind of truth..."" that makes the difference.&nbsp; (86)&nbsp; Same also with the ""social organism"" he instists: ""Wherever a desired result is achieved by the co-operation of many independent persons, its existence as a fact is a pure consequence of the precursive faith in one another of thos immediately concerned.""&nbsp; (87)&nbsp; He gives a good example where the lack of that desired result is destructive to communal action: ie a train can be robbed by two highwaymen because the passengers fear that noone will back him up if he does something.&nbsp;</p>
<p>* So: ""There are, then, cases where a fact cannot come at all unless a preliminary faith exists in its coming.&nbsp; <em>And where faith in a fact can help create a fact</em>, that would be an insance logic which should say that faith running ahead of scientific evidence is the 'lowest kind of immorality' into which a thinking being can fall.&nbsp; Yet such is the logic by which our scientifici absolutists pretend to regulate our lives!"" (87)</p>

The Origins of American Social Science,"[Dorothy's use of intentionality in her study]
In the ""Introduction"" to her book Dorothy uses the word ""decision"" to describe the development of exceptioanlist American social science:  ""A Still higher poing of scientific apirations was reached in the 1950s, when quantitative modleing, sytems of analysis, funcitonalism, and behavioral science gained wide currency, but the decision to seek out a ntural scientific path and the undelrying view of the social historical world asd a relam of natural process had already been forgted by the 1920s.""  (xiv) I noticed also that she uses this word ""decision"" in her short entry on ""American Exceptionalism"" in A Companion to American Thought.  
I wondered what was at stake here.  The answer is twofold as I see it.  Firstly, it  is wrapped up with her methodological approach.  Secondly, it is tied to her own goals in writing about exceptioanlism.  
A few pages later when she is immersed in an explanation of her method she describes her approach as ""intellecutal history which seeks to reconstruct the discourse within which social scientists worked.""  At the end of this sentence she cites that her understanding of discourse comes from essays by Pocock and Hollinger on method.  Then she has the following sentence: ""I understand discourse as conversation, developed over time, centering around certain problems, setting the terms of discussion over time, centering aroudn certain problems, setting the terms of discusison for those who enter itno it, and at the same time responding to different intentions of participants.""  (my italics) (xviii-xix).
1) These two words ""decision"" and ""intentions"" are linked.  Dorothy is therefore giving an emphasis in her anlaysis to the intentions of her actors in theri writing.  This focus on intentions is I think modeled on Pocock and others' theorization of a model of discourse as being split between a language and various instances of speech acts in which the language is deployed strategically in a context to achieve a certain result.  DR epxlains this on xix.  In my own work, I think I have deemphasized intentionality a bit, trying to give a picture ina ny case of the characters as being a bit more awash in meaning.  That is consistent I think with the greater emphasis on a culture and on discourse as blinding things, on semiotic complexity as a result of polysemy.  As well as a sense that a speech act model does not really work very well in the early twentieth century in which discourses have become so complex, in which one might say the public sphere is in the process of shredding... 
2) The relation between her focus on intentionality and her goals became evidence on xxi when she talks about her  purpose in writing: ""My larger purpose, for which I hold out less hope of success, is that by demonstrating the eextent to which social sciencei choices were rooted in history, I can suggest that those choices are open to rexamination.  Social scientists may have had 'good reasons' for choosing their scientistic path, but they were reasons consistently hemmed in by their historical intentions."" (xxi)  Thus the pay-off of focusing on intentions is to suggest that social scientists were responsibly for the way their sciences were formed, and if they were responsible those intentions might be modified in the futre and other reasons for action developed...."
"Gender, Professional Knowledge, and Institutional Power: Women Social Scientists and the Research University","<p>00 Summarial Note 00  Article examines as case-studies the careers of different women at different universities in the the US in the 1920s and 1930s.  Several basic conclusions come from these case studies:  Most importantly, that there were severe limits to the openness of these institutions to women.  The idea, therefore, that these institutions were open to women on a ""meritocratic"" basis is thus not so true: ""There is no question that women were excluded from and marginalized in the 'meritocratic' modern university in the United States in the first half of the twentieth century."" (67)  Then a series of small conclusions are yielded:  -- Everything varied by ""institutional location.""  Dzuback summarizes her case studies this way: ""In these cases it [limits of power for women] ranged from the extreme marginal position of the Harvard women to the near integration of the Berkeley women."" (68)    -- Philanthropy was key to the success of women's careers.  Funds from the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial fund for instance heped provide funding in different ways to many of the women in Dzuback's studies.  (68-69)  -- Support from male colleagues was also ""critical to women's ability develop institutional power."" ((69)   -- Finally, Dzuback also finds that in many of her case studies, these women academics were at oddes with the growing scientism in social science after World War I&gt;  (70).  One striking example of this that she gives is the work of Sophonisba Breckinridge and Edith Abott at The University of Chicago, where they opposed the socio-ecological model of the ""Chicago School"" social scientists.  (67).</p>"
"In Pursuit of Equity: Women, Men, and the Quest for Economic Citizenship in 20th-Century America","<p>p.003-6  The book's topic</p>
<p>Early twentieth century it was commonplace to distinguish between men and womens economically based on a conception of their different roles in thef family.  E.g. 1937 US Supreme Court sustains a Georgia law that allowed women to pay a lower poll tax""in view of the burdens necesssarily borne by them for the preservation of the race."" (3)  Similarly, 1948, the Supreme Court upholds a Michicgan prohibition agains women working as bartenders unless they were the wives or daughters of the (male) owners of the bar.  The presumption was that in this case the men would look after the moral virtue of the women.  (3)</p>
<p>These decisions were normal at the time.  They fit into the general feeling that most men and women agreed upon until perhaps the 1960s that ""the normal order of family life properly subsumed women within its boundaries, rendring their needs and desires as well as rights and obligations secondary to those of husbands and children."" (3)</p>
<p>That general attitude governed traditional economic practices and institutiosn that we might describe as ""traditional"": ""the sexual division of labor; disparate wages for male and female jobs; the feminization of poverty; protective labor legislation for women only; women's dependence on government welfare.""  (3)</p>
<p>These practices K-H says were for many not thought to be ""unfair or unjust"" becasue they sustained a ""comforting vision of family life and social order."" (4)  If women were thus prevented from education or economic independence that was ok because they posessed a ""protective umbrella to which men could not lay claim."" (4)</p>
<p>BUT then in the 1930s, when the government began to construct a system of public benefits and tax incentives, they linked these policies not to family membership but to wage-work (benefits like old-age pensions, unemployment insurance, etc.)  This created two types of citizenship: one rooted in family membership and the other in wage-work.   At this time 85% of families had a single breadwinner and most marraiges tended to last the entire lifetime of an individual.  This reinforced the presumption that mostly male heads of households shoudl receive special benefits, an assummption that was buitl into a network of government policies.  It also reinforced the idea of a ""family wage"".  These special benefits began in the 1930s and were expanded after WWII.</p>
<p>So as the US begins to define its version of what T.H. Hulme defines as ""social citizenship"" that it links it to (male) wage-work and not citizenship or residency as is the case in most European countries.  And this pattern rests on the presumption that it is ""fair"" to assume that women will draw their livelihood from the family.</p>
<p>Such social policy left out those who did not fit the presumed demographic prrofile, including never-married women, divorced and deserted women (i.e. female heads of families), and African-American families whose male heads of household could not get work.  During WWII, married women who took jobs also found themselves in an ""anomolous position as family members with paid employment."" (5)  ""Those who claimed social beneifts that accured to the fully employed seemed to be violating the standards of an employment-based citizenship."" (5)  Women then began to notice the pattern of exclusion and by the 1960s, the idea that tax breaks or social beneifts should bre tied to gender and marital status did not seem quite that fair anymore.</p>
<p>That comes to the topic of the book:</p>
<p>""This book aims to explore how particular ideas of fairness became embedded in American social institution in the twentieth century.  It investigates how these institutions came to reflect claims to normalcy and to shape them.  It argues that gender-racialized gender--constitutes a central piece of the social imaingary around which social organization and ideas of fairness are constructed and on which social policies are built. And it tells the story of how gendered habits of mind--which I sometimes called the ""gendered imagination""--framed discussion of what was possible and shape the politically plausible."" (5-6).</p>
<p>The books builds on her earlier book on <em>A Woman's Wage </em>that explored the idea of a family wage.  (7)  She saw this ""male sense of entitlement in jobd and wages"" as permeating ""economic life, reflecting and perpetuating the social organization of families, labor market opportunities, and the relationships of men and women in and outside the work place.""  (7)  Specificailly it seemed to shape conceptions of ""individual liberty"" that were not presumed to have breen of value for women: ""Ideals of service and sacrifice to children, parents, and spouse ahve often been though to render liberty for women irrelevant and women's search for individual rights 'selfish.'  Under this rubric, many Americans and their legislative assemlbies have felt free to treat women differently from men in many respects: refusing them the righ tot vote, to serve on juries, or to receive econoimc and social benefits in the same way as men.""

Beyond Separate Spheres: Intellectual Roots of Modern Feminism,"p.147 General role of Anth

Psychologists had aruged that feminist raits were rootedin ""social expectation."" (147) undermining the idea that evolution had produced innate differences in the mind. (147)  But reformers were hesitant to grasp idea that one should therefore remove the division of labor.  ""To interfere with this sexual specialization, many feared, was to risk returning to a simple and less highly evolved epoch by undercutting this most basic of social divisions."" (147)  

Therefore it was important when anthropolgosits began to critique the genreal theory of cultural evoluiton.  (147)"
"From Experts to Social Scientists: The American Anthropologists, 1929-1963","p.018-19  Struggle over Anthropology at Chicago mid-1920s

Madden says that the sociologists at Chicago wanted to ""carve up anthropology so that each subfield of sociology would have an anthropological component.""  (18)  Fay Cooper Cole and R. Redfeld realized that anthropology at Chicago needed autonomy after a dispute between Benjamin Fairs a sociologist and Cole over the methods of Leslie White's dissertation.  (18) 

1929 - Univ ""granted Cole and Redfield an indepdnent anthropology department."" (19)  

1930 Sapir leaves for Yale.  Cole and Redfield the only fully-time faculty.  But there is money... Both the UNi and anth. dept. ahve close ties to the Rockefeller Foundation.  ""Cole was able to secure $75,000 grant from the Foundation to support the department in the early thirties.  He also convinced Adolph Lichstern to leave a segment of his estate to chiacgo anthropology i 1931, otaling some $300,000.  With these large sums of money available, through the 1930s,  he built the most prominent department of anthropology in the United States."" (19)"
"The Soul's Economy: Market Society and Selfhood in American Thought, 1820 - 1920","<p>p.205 Charles Cooley and the ""looking glass self""</p>
<p>It seems that Sklansky finds in the thought of Charles Cooley the crucial shift to a particulary extreme conception of the ""social self"" that was also theorized in his account by John Dewey, George Herbert Mead.</p>
<p>He also mentions James Livingston here on the idea of a 'cultural revolution' of the late nineteenth century and early twentieth centuries, in which an older understanding of self and society was decisively undermined."" (205-206)&nbsp; The Livingtson book is <em>Pragmatism and the Political Economy of Cultural Revolution, 1850-1940</em>.</p>
<p>In any case, Sklansky stars the chapter by noting that Cooley was ""prodigously self-conscious"" of what other people thought of him and that he assumed that this was also what selfhood meant.&nbsp; (205) Cooley thus defined a ""looking-glass self"" and Sklansky quotes him here: ""As we see our face, figure, and dress in the glass, and are interseted in them because they are ours, and pleased or otheriwse with them according as they do or do not answer to what we should like them to be; so i imagination we perceive in another's mind some thought of our apperance, manners, aims, deeds, characters, friends, and so on, and are variously affected by it...""&nbsp; And: ""We always imagine, and in imaginign share, the judgements of the other mind."" (quoted on 205)</p>
<p>Sklansky writes then: ""[Cooley's] pathbreaking studies of such 'imaginative sociability' entitle him to primary credit [of course Sklansky doesn't think this is good] for that master creation of modern American socail science, the 'social self.'"" (205)</p>

The Problem of American Exceptionalism: A Reconsideration,"<p>Summary Note</p>
<p>This article serves as a survey of the problem of American Exceptionalism in the historiography of the United States.  From the 1970s onward Kammen argues that historians of the United States have been critical of ""American Exceptionalism"", which he defines as ""the notion that the United States has had a unique destiny in history, or more modestly, a history with highly disctinctive features or an unusual trajectory"" (6) This had meant more practically that they have been averse to making claims about the uniqueness of U.S. experience, society or institutions.  Kammen proposes to appraise the history and decide whether it is justified.  His tendency is to suggest that in fact one should not wholly avoid claims of the uniqueness of U.S. history and he shows at various points that even those scholars such as Eric Foner, Ian Tyrell, Sean Wilentz, Akira Iriye,  and C. Van Woodward that have made such claims have also in their work at times described certain elements of U.S. history as unique or distinctive.  One part of his article is to note that comparative history has been avoided or where it has been heeded the empahsis has been upon describing similarities and downplaying differences. He also points out that few skeptics of AmEx have noted the idea that to look at subnaitonal units might help get a handle on AmEx (3).  Much of the analysis of the disctinvnes of the U.S. that Kammen finds compelling has to do with U.S. political parties, labor groups, the power of business elites vis-a-vis the government, etc.  On Business elites see e.g. p.5.. .He summarizes claims of distinctiveness in the second to alst sectio 16-24.</p>
<p>I find this article weak analytically.  His definition of AmEx is vague and inconsistent.  It's quite a different thing for AmEx to be a simple claim that there is something distinctive about U.S. history and the idea that it has a special mission.  Also throughout the article AmEx seems often to be reduce simply to any claim that there is something distinctive at all about U.S. history, but in my estimation that is not what AmEx is at all.  My sense of what AmEx is connectss most closely to what he describes as ""Americanism"" or the ""meaning of America.""  (10-11, 26-27)  That is, the idea that the notion of America stands in somehow for history.  He comes close to it when he says that ""The 'meaning of America,' so rich with moralistic implicaitons for the future, and for people not fortunate enough to be Americans, perhaps sered as a surrogate for history."" (26)  But Kammen doesn't quite get it, and he seems not to have engaged with DR's work at all (was it not published yet?).  He discusses her on 26, but then has no citation in the footnote #72.  He seems to conclude with this idea at the top of Section IV that ""we are obliged to acknolwedge the swiftly spreading perception that 'every country is different'...""  But that is just not a claim that opposses AmEx.  I don't think that to claim that the U.S. has unique features in its history (which from a historistic point of view is almost an assumption) but rather that AmEx is a form of antionalist ideology.  He gets at this on 26-27, but it's sort of an aside...</p>

His point here is that for some professions, he mentions law, professionalism was effective in serving practiioner's interests, ""effectivley controling entrance into the field."" (1053). 

Not so for Social Work -- and for women in general --  ""For women...professionalism as an ideology and an identity obscured shifting working conditions job autonomy and middle-class living standards.  Professionalism stil lshaped how these owmen oranized and defined themselves, but women in professions such as social work found achievements illusory and problematic.""  (1053)"

<p>000 Critique 000 I think their attack on the focus on ""perosnality"" is interesting. I was thinkin gthis in response to Geyer's idea that there were different contradicting publics proposing different forms of identity in Weimar Germany, that people were trying to sift through these in his piece on ""Resisistence Studies."" Was it then the multiple and unstable idientities that was the problem? Does the ""modern self"" need to be premised on a singular and stable model? The authors propose a preventative and dynamic and never-ending awareness of certain attitudes that when they come into existence might be combated. But then this is a rather compromised solution. On the other hand, if one doesn't compromise does this mean that one needs to posit once again a singular ""healthy personality structure"" as Adorno et al put it in The Authoritarian Personality""??</p>

(74) Inquired in particular into the ""authoritarian personality"". They designed four scaled: Anti-Semitism, Ethnocentrism, Political and Economic Conservatism, and the fourth ""Potentiality for Fascism."" (73) This last they say focused on ""personality rather than attitude."" It was called the F-Scale and its 9 components listed on p.74. table 1: They are Conventionalism, Authoritarian submission, Authoritarian aggression, Anti-intraception, Supersitition and Stereotypy, Power and toughness, Destructiveness and cyncism, Projectivity, and Sex... The method. Questions were asked and answered on a scale from +3 to -3 (then transferred ontol a scale of 1-7, with 7 as most authoritarian and 1 as least.) Type of questioning called a Lickert (as opposed to Guttman) scale. Described as folows: ""A scaled of this kind asked Americans to indicate how close to them they would allow people of particular races and nationalities to come: to their country, state, county, neighbourhood, street, and so on."" (73) Initial study applied to 2,000 people in California. In addition 80 individuals that scored high and low on Ethnocentrism were interviewed about ""upbringing, family relations and career aspirations."" (74) And these 80 were given Thematic Apperception Test. Findings then indciated a ""number of types, groups of subjects, who showed consistent patterns of scores on the various tests and indicative characteristics in the interviews."" And they focused on the ""authoritarian perosnality types"" in the study. ""which ""scored high on scales of Anti-Semitic, ethnocentric and conservative attitudes, despite the variety of content, and also scored high on the F-scale itself."" 74) (74-5)</li>
<li id=""i1870"">p.75-8 Reception of Study In 40s Am. social psych. community receptive. They were interested in prejudice and conformity. In particular those psychsthat belonged to ""the Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues (SPSSI) whose publication, the Journal of Social Issues, together iwth the Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, had an almost campaigning approach."" Notes work on ""action research in Times Square"" and ""how to confront the anti-Semitic bigot in public situations."" (75) Also works like Achieving Inter-cultural Understanding and Co-operation in a Democracy (1953) by Saenger Criticisms of study focused on methods and how certainly such a ""authoritarian persaonlity"" could be said to exist. E.g. M. Smith reviewed it and thought it useful, that it showed that ""there is something there"" but they needed better instrumetns to detect it... (75-76) In England Henry Dicks who had been studying ""personality traits and national socialist ideology among German prisoners of war"" (76) early came to know about the study. Dicks then went to work with Edward shils at U.Chicago. (76) In 1965 Roger Brown summarized in his Social Psychology the social and political importance of the study. Noted that it had entered popular culture and the popular equivalent of ""authoritarian"" was ""bigot."" As such he argued that it had ""become part of popular culture and a force against racial discrimination."" (76) Hofstadter also picked up the idea in his The Paranoid Style in American Politics (1966)...he took from it the notion of ""pseudo-conservative"" and quoted the book directly. The quote was: ""The pseudo-conservative is a man who, in the name of upholding traditional American values and institutions and defending them against more or less fictional dangers, consciously or unconsciously aims at their abolition."" Hofstadter contrasted such pseudos- from true conservatives who he described as ""temperate and compromising...in the classical sense of the word..."" (76-77) Authors argue that what then came to be known in the 50s as ""McCarythism"" bore, at leaqst in account of Richard Rovere's study, a ""striking resemblence to those [traits] that emerged from the [The Authori. Pers.}"" (77) Thus as wartime alliance with Russians forgotten and as ""'international communism' was replacing fascism as the perceived threat to world peace"" the ideas of the study seemed perhaps to apply to the new attitudes developing twoard the Russians and the communists. But the authors note that Sanford for one, even in midst of the Univ. of Calif. that was requring employees to take a loyalty oath, that such attitudes were not necessarily authoritarian... (78). But Sanford and 45 others did not sign, and then Sanford and Edward Tolman were dismissed, and then reinstated in Nov. 1952 after a court case. The authors then write, however, ""[w]hile the attack on individuals was rapid an ddirect, the critique of ideas was extended and more complex."" (78)

<li id=""i2297"">p. 78-87 Critiques and Left-Right Authoritarianism As the argument developed, basically the notion of the authoritarian personality was co-opted/critiqued by a group of psychologists that are a component of neo-conservatism. Most importantly, E.A. Shils posited the idea in a book ed. by Richard Christie and Marie Johoda entitled ""On the Method and Scope of the Authoritarian Personality"" (1954). Shils ' article entitled ""Authoritarianism, Right and Left"" argued there was a left-authoritariansim, that it was similar or worse to right-authoritarianism. Shils critiqued the political spectrum of the Authoritarian Personality as too linear, going from fascist to ""complet democrat"". The authors write: ""...for Shils, the 'complete democratics' of the study were crypto-communists."" (80) And: ""Shils proporsed to aggregate the categories of right-wing and left-wing authoritariansim, stressing what he saw as their essential similarity."" (81) This move by Shils was important...it elevated communism to the new enemy, positied its similarity in these psychological terms, to fascism, and prepared the ground for the ""End of History"" that would come after 1989... In '93 Stone and Smith noted the political significance of this dev.: ""Many former liberal commentators and social scientists caught the spirit of the times and perceived the threat posed by Communism. Among the intellectuals so affected were Norman Podhertz, Daniel Bell and, most notably, Edward Shils...The term 'neo-conservative' came to be applied to these former liberals."" (80) But authors' note that Shils' category had little empirical basis in his original articles. (bottom 81) In section ""The search for the Left Authoritariansim"" 82-84 a aseries of empirical projects attempt to ""discover"" this left-authoritarian personality, but it is not easily found apparently. Hard to study too also b/c in U.S, ironically, lefties b/c of McCarthyism too scared to be identified as such , see 82 for their note. Defense of the argument of Authorit. Personality came from Bob Altemeyer, Canadian, who ""developed a Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RAW) scale to explore three attitudinal clusters: authoritarian submission; authoritarian aggression; and conventionalism."" And he designed a scale to measure left-wing, but then concluded ultimately that this left-wing authoritarianism could not be discovered: ""Is there an authoritarian left? No, not if you are talking about Shils' left, not if you require evidence. Lots of people have looked in several different ways in several different countries for this creature of lore. But no one has found it yet."" (quoted on 85). And the authors say that ""Altemeyer's work is clealry in the tradition of The Authoritarian Personality..."" (85) They quote him in '86 essentially repeating in 1996 the claim that authoritarianism could happen in the U.s. too... After fall of the wall, there was a search in the ex-communist countries, but there too much of the authoritarianism seemed to be right-wing they argue... (86-87)

<li id=""i1500"">p.87 The ""end of History"" and the Authoritarian Personality The authors' first note that the original authors of Authoritarian Personality believed the problem to be exposed to historical contingency. The authoritarian person Horkheimer wrote as ""an 'anthropological' species...[that] seems to combine the ideas and skills o fthe highly industrialised society with irrational or anti-rational beliefs."" (quoted on 87) The authors therfore write ""any change in the political economy of industrial society should be examined for its impact on the human psyche generally and authoritarianism in particular."" (87) The authors' note Fukyama's argument and the idea that there was a world-wide liberal revolution. They point out that Fukuyama also implicitly invoked an argument about psychology. He wrote: ""no democracy without democrats"" (88) But he had only the outline of a perosnality type through the classical theorists e.g. Hobbes' man in state o fnature on up to the ""last man"" at the end of history. Others developed it, including the JJ. Ray who was the last advocate of the existence of left-wing authoritarianism. He wrote in ""The Death of Authoritarianism: Psychological Parallels ot a Political Phenomenon"" that this peronality type was disappearing even in communist regimes where even ""Communist Party members were now denying authoritarian attitudes in their questionnaire response."" (88) The autors though think that this idea of the ""Ne World Order has not fared well"" due to ""choas in the countries of the former Soviet Union and in the newly industrializing countries of the third world. The concept of world-wide revolution has proved problematic."" And they add the neo-libera economics are now ""associated with a renewed political authoritariansim."" (89)

<li id=""i1880"">p.89-93 Contiued research The authors then argue that there has been continued reseach, that despite the statement that the authoritarian personality was dead, it has not died. And it seems to continue to be discussed. The critique they ultimately endorse is that the original book focused too closley on ""personality"" that is they say on ""character"" as opposed to ""cummulative and attitudinal"" dimensions that would stress the ability to understand why authoritarian personalities may turn to the exercise of fascism and when and, most importantly, how it can be countered. (see esp. 91-93) Imp. for this conclusion is the point also that the original book did little to get at the question see 91. In the original book they had written only in terms of prevention in terms of encouraging a ""healthy personality structure..."" But what would this be? What is a helathy personality structure? What is a personality structure? Is ther eonly one ""healthy personality structure""????</li>

A Four-Fold Humanity: Margaret Mead and Psychological Types,"p.186-187  Temperament, Sources

186: IN 1933 Mead app. not yet aware that sex differences were not innate...  

In ""Summary Statement of the Problem of Personality and Culture"" from 1933 she still stated that these ideas were right.  Still working with maternal and paternal (M and F).  

186-187: In stating the problem of ""reproducing one's kind"" she says that in addition to process of conception, physical shape etc, Temperament is important.  

187: Temperament.  Mead was probably drawing on  William McDougall who she mentions in Summary Statement.  She knew him as studend at Barnard while earning her masters sullivan says.  His theory of temperament is McDougall, An INtroduction to Sociology (pub. orig. 1908)others... An outline of Psychology 1923; an outline of of abnormaly psych. (1933)...   McDougall used the word """"to refer to those psychologicla and emotional propensities or tendencies that arise directly out of the person's innate biological inheritance..."" (187) Building on Jung, introver and extrovert were his primary examples. 

Jung had also written of this (this is the primordial self that Sapir speaks of?) and Jung had seen them as being rooted in biology.  Because they were ""little affected by 'conscious judgement or intention' yet are 'universal psychological phenomen[a], must in some way or other have biological precursor[s]"" (187)  (From Jung, Pscyhological types or the pscyhology of individuation, 414 in 1923 ed; orig pub 1921.)  And Jung also thought they overran the sex distinction.  Jung wrote: ""Furthermore, these types over-rdie the distinctions of sex, since one finds the same contrasts among women of all classes..."" (187) (see p.413, of 1923 ed.)  

Mead wrote then  in the Summary Statement that family inheritance was operational and not ""sex inheritance""  (187)"
Professions and Patriarchy,"<p>Summary Note</p>
<p>Witz has noted a gap in the scholarship on the sociology of professions.  She puts it clearly:</p>
<p>""The 'sociology of professions' has a somewhat dated and staid aura about it, perhaps most associated with fairly turgid and 'Whiggish' accounts of professional men (cf Carr-Saunders and Wilson 1933, Reader 1966).  The traditional sociology of the professions was thoroughly criticized by Johnson (1972) as long ago as the early 1970s for uncritically reproducing at the level of sociological knowledge professionals' own definitions of themselves as possessing distinctive characteristics that marked them off from the ordinary run of managers, administrators, clerical workers, and the so-called 'semi-profesionals' such as radiographers, nurses, and physiotherapists.  More recently, much attention has been paid to the relationships between professions and the class structure, and this focus has led to a radical recasting of sociological approaches ot the study of professions.  But within this new critical theory of the professions, little attentions has bene paid to the relation btween gender and profesisonalisation."" (1)</p>
<p>She notes that there has been a link between professionalisation and gender.  She notes in particulary Etzioii's 1969 book on the ""semi-professions,"" but later work she notes has deployed rather simple ocnceptions of gender that ""rely on explanations whic hrefer to the gendered attributes (such as women's association with 'caring' work) in order to read off the subordinate realtion of, say, nursing to medicine."" (2)  Such accounts see gender as static and leave untheorized certain ""gender-specific attributes, attitudes and 'problesm which women 'bring to' professional employment."" (2)</p>
<p>That leads to a tendency to look at thechallenges women face in ""adjusting to typically male career patterns"" when joiing male-dominated professions: namely, the dual-role problem of being mother and professional.</p>
<p>In seeking a more complex understanding of the relationship between gender and the professions, Witz says the concept of patriarchy must be introduced.  She notes that the concept has been much debated but that it is now used by ""contemporary feminist scholars more braodly to refer to ender relation in which men are dominant and women subordinate.  It therefore describes a societal-wide system of social relations of male domainnce (cf Millet 1972, Hartman 1979, 1981), not simply those in the family/household."" (3)  So against patriarchy's critics (Bradley 1989, Crompton and Sanderson 1989, Acker 1989, and Rowbotham 1981) she thinks it is useful in examining the complexities of gender relations in the modern system of professions. (3)</p>
<p>In Part I of the book she wworks out how patriarchy relates to the professions.  In Chapter 1, she states her belief that the dual-system theroists are best able to conceptualize women's position in the professional labor market.  Chapter 2 seeks to understand why and how ""the generic concept of profession is also an impliitly gendered one"" (5).  In Part II, she looks at differnet historical cases.  The most interesting for me is her examinaaiton of radiography where she notes men failed to exclude women.</p>
<p>Witz makes a lot of use of a line of analysis of occupations stemming from Johnson and expanded by neo-Weberians that understand professionalisation as a means of controlling an occupation.  It seems to me that this line is also influencing Abbott, but would need to check.  Abbott's jurisdictional dispute theme is almost present in Witz's anslysis but not as well worked out here.  See for examqple p.47 when she talked about ""occupational imperialism"" which I believe Abbott also discusses.  Or her discussion of ""demarcationaary strategies"" and ""inter-occupational control"" on 46.</p>

The Clash of Civilizations?,"p.42 Torn Countries and Homogenous Ones

Homogenous ones usually pursue band-wagoning.  Torn ones, ones that ""have a fair degree of culturla homogeneity but are divided over wheter their society belongs to one civilization or another."" (42) are interesting.  Turkey is a classic case.  He notes that it applied to the EU, that it has this secular ""western"" background, that it allied with the WEST i Nato and in the Gulf War, but its elites see it as essentially Muslim.  He quotes Prsident Özal who said °we are Muslim and they are Christian and they donàt say that."" (42) He notes also that b/c of fall of S.U. Turkey sees a chance to revive Turkic civilization and now encouraged b the west, ""Turkey is making strenuous efforts to carve out this new idenity for itself."" (42) 

 Mexico is another exampel but not as severely, though impotantly for the U.S.  (42-3)

Russia now again has become a torn country 43-4.

waist.  1912 women began to ""tuck-under"" their hair with a ribbon.  by 1913-1914 Newport laides like actress Pauline Frederick or Irene Castle were wearing short hair."
The Making of a Feminine Professional Identity: Social Workers in the 1920s,"p. 1069 - 1074  Professional Woman

So here Walkowitz presents his construct of the Professional Woman , which he says reflects the ""dissonance created for female social workers by their negative image in mass media and the contradictory circumstances associated with their professional work, and... emerged from the multiple culturla exchanges between workers clients and their public audience."" (1069) 

She possessed he said ""some mal eattributres, but she was careful not to appear to compete with or threaten men."" (1069)  Instead, she maintained her status by trying ""to keep less qualified {page} women out of the field."" (1070) 

He notes the AASW's effort to conter bad press in the movie ""It"" and that they did so by celebrating ""male"" values of objectivity. (1070) 

He then looks at self-representations.  and here he says ""Their unstable, and contested ideas of gender and professionalism suggest the confusion and pain with which some caseworkers respondedot the image of the female social worker as an aggressive, ambitious New Woman.  The stories make clear tha tfeamle social workers felt torn between their roles as women and rpfessionals, each of which emboied in different ways the qualities of 'good ' social work.  They also were frustrated by their inability to afford the accouterments of middle-class status."" (1070)  

So he finds a series of different profiles.  A woman who is scatter-brained but can learn from her boyfriend how to organize herself, and then she has a good sex life with him. (1070-1)  Women who are organized but have trouble meeting men.  They are ""too smart, too intimidating to potential male suitors."" (1071)   And they don't have enough money to set up a home that can attract ""'comfort-loving' desirables."" (1072) and they have become ""narrow, self-absorbed individuals"" unable to talk about general things with ""outsiders"" (1072)."

Über das Verhältness des transscendentalen zum metaphysischen Idealismus,"<p>Notes September 2014:</p>
<p>* Lehmann starts out by saying that what Kant had said over the thing-in-itself (Dinge an sich), namely that the thing-in-itself was the ground of the appearance of the objective world, had a primarily epistemological meaning. And yet he notes that it is in fact it is a the expression of a metaphysical conception, which can be seen as the quintessence of a kantian metaphysics. (346)</p>
<p>* So there is not so much of a surprise, he thinks, that post-kantian metaphysics has mostly been lnfluenced by this element of kant's philosophy. (346)</p>
<p>* He describes German philosophy as developing out of Kant in this way, until it reached Schopenhauer, at which point it took a turn that seemingly led it back to its point of origin. And this shift, in Schopenhauer, demonstrated he says what changes (Wandlungen) the basic principle of the critique of reason needed to suffer( erliden) in order to become the basis for a new dogmatism (""ehe sie als metaphysische Grundzuege einer neuen dogmatischen Weltanschauung reproduciert werden konnten."" (346-7) That in fact he says was Schopenhauer's method, in so far as he had one, namely the ""transference of the epistemological concepts of Kant into the metaphysical..."" (""in einer durchgängigen Uebertragung der erkenntnisstheoretischen Begriffe Kant's ins Metaphysische"" (347). He says that when it came to Kant, Schopenhauer's philosophical system consisted of a series of such hypostatizations of epistemological concepts and opinions (""sine philosophisches System, soweit es sich an Kant anschliest, besteht aus einer Reihe von derartigen ypostasen erkenntnisstheoretischer Begriffe und Anschauungen."") (347) Behind this accusation of hypostatization is the idea that this was a key part of Kant's critique of reason, that one should *not* hypostatize ideas! See here: <a href=""http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2009/entries/kant-metaphysics/#HypSub"">http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2009/entries/kant-metaphysics/#HypSub</a></p>
<p>* Given this he notes that if the ""scientific principles of the critique of reason"" (""die grossen wissenschaftlichen Grundgedanken der Vernunftkritik"") are not to be lost than there will be a need to go in a very different direction and in fact to start again, ""von neum zu beginnen."" (347)</p>
<p>* So here is where Lehmann locates neo-Kantianism: ""Der Neu-Kantianismus, welcher diese Aufgabe ergriff, hat sich vornerhin mit derselben Entscheidenheit der erkenntnisstheoretischen Seite der Transcendentalphilosophie zugewandt, mit welcher die bisherige Speculation sich an die metaphysische gehalten hatte."" (347) Or: ""The neo-Kantianism, which seized this task, seized the epistemological side of transcendental philosophie with the same determination that the previous speculation (?, is this a reference to Speculative philosophy) had sized upon the metaphysical."" (347)</p>
<p>* He thinks that a metaphysical dogmatism, which entered into Kant's system against Kant's own will, is basically inconsisent with the ends of the critique of reason, the ""Endbasichten der Vernunftkritik."" (347) And he thinks that the teaching of the thing-in-itself (""die Lehre von Ding an sich"") is the weakest part of Kant's philosophy, and yet it is this part of Kant's thought that was of the great service to Schopenhauer. (347) In fact, he sees it as the ""chief task"" (""Hauptaufgabe') of modern Kantian philosophy to ""excise: the concept of the thing-in-itself from the critique of reason. (""Den Begriff des Dinges an sich aus der Vernunftkritik zu entfernen, durch Ausmerzung dieser wunden Stelle den Reultaten der Transcendentalphilosophie wissenschaftliche Exactheit und dauernde Unerschütterlichkeit zu verliehen, darf man denn auch geradezu als die Hauptaufgabe bezeichnen, die sich die moderne Kantphilosophie gesetzt hat."" (348) His language gets quite good here. The goal is he says is ""to change the course of the fundamental teachings of the critique of reason in such a way that disposes of all the metaphysical slag/scum, and in this way to secure the epistemological results..."" (""den Grendlehren der Vernunftkritik eine Wendung zu geben, die sie aller metaphysischen Schlacken entledigt, und eben hierdurch ihre erkenntnisstheoretischen Resultate dauernd sicher zu stellen."") (348)</p>
<p>* Here again he says it was this task, in part throuhg essentially kritical and negative means&nbsp; ('zum Theil wesentlich kritischem und negativem Wege""), that neo-Kantianism took on. (348). ""One searched for a point from which one could develop Kant's ideas in order that all the residual dimensions of his teaching would fall away."" (""den Rest seiner Lehre fallen zu lassen."") (348) By the residuum here I assume that he's referring to the metaphysical dimension, die Lehre vom Ding an Sich.""&nbsp;</p>
<p>* He sees this effort as starting importantly with O. LIebmann's book ""Kant und die Epigonen"". The goal of this book is to separate the durable from the non-durable in Kant's philosophy. (348) He notes that even H. Cohen, who he describes as having hoped to remain truer to the form of his philosophy that Kant himself gave it, still ended up throwing out the concept of the thing-in-itself, which in fact was only mentioned once in the critique of reason. (348)</p>
<p>* Yet he points out that it has ow become clear as a result of these efforts by neo-Kantians that the problem of modern philsophy is by no means easy to solve. The metaphysical concept is so grown together (""verwachsen"") with Kant's system that it is impossible to cut it out without ""rebuilding the entire structure."" (""ohne den ganzen Aufbau von Grun aus umyugestalten."") (348) He uses as an example the fact that the most significant ('bedeutendste"") of all the neo-Kantians, F.A. Lange, had found it useful in his ""reproduction of Kant's fundmantal teachings"" to include/carry over/continue (hinuebernehmen) the concept of the thing-in-itself. (348) And he notes that it is also for this reason that those who have opposed Kant have doubted that his philosophy can do without it, and in fact, he notes that all those who have opposed Kant ahve suggested that all those who have tried to work through Kant's teaching on the thing-in-itself to estalbish the possibility of expeirence, have in fact demonstrated its impossibility. He cites here E.v. Hartmann in particular. (348-349)</p>
<p>* Then he has some sentences where he seems to say that the thing-in-itself is not the ""essential seed"" (""eigentlichen Kern"") of the critique of reason. And that even for those who think that the thing-in-itself is essential, it is still not the case that ""metaphysical idealism"" is the consequence of ""transcendental idealism."" (349)</p>
<p>* Then he seems to begin an exercise where he wants to go through the logic in a bit more detail. He wants to reflect a bit on each of the ""oppositional claims"" (""gegnerischen Behauptung"").</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* First he lays out what he thinks is a general understanding of Kant's funamental metaphysical point of view. This comes on top of 350 and it reads very well for me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Die ganze sogennante reale Welt mit allem, was in ihr bleibt und vergeht, ist das ""Product unserer Sinne und unseres Verstandes"", erbaut aus dem Stoffe der Empfindung, gestaltet durch die Formen unserer Anschauung und unseres Denkens; ja auch was wir unser Ich zu nennen pflegen, der anschauende und denkende, fühlende und wollende Mench ist nichts als Phänomen von einem tief in ihm selber leigenden, nie erkennbaren, weil selbst nur immer erkennenden Bewusstsein. Aber doch ist diese Welt, aber doch ist der erkennende Mensch kein blosser Schein, keine ""absolute Illusion"", vielmehr liegt alledem etwas völlig Reales, an sich Wirkliches, zu Grunde, von keinem Werden und Vergehen berührt, aber auch von keinem Erkennen zu erreichen. (350)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>* Yet the issue that arises from this viewpoint is the question about what ""bridges"" these two worlds -- i.e. the world of appearances and the unknowable world of reality that lies behind, i.e. the thing-in-itself. How can we link our thinking to that which underlies our thinking but which we cannot think. ""[können wir durch unser Denken verbinden, was unserm Denken nich errichbar ist? und wenn wir es nicht können, wer gibt uns das Recht von jenem ewig Unerreichbaren auch nur zu behaupten, dass es existiert?"" (350)</p>
<p>* Kant believed the bridge lay in fudnamental concepts which he linked to sensory perception. The ""stuff"" of our conceptions (Anschauungen) is given form by the spontanous function of thought, and it is through this process that the ""objective"" or ""empirical"" world is constructed (""gebildet""). (350) Therefore the impressions or conceptios of the world that we have are neither entirely objective or subjective. They can't be ""explained"" in that way. They must be ""gewirkt"" in relation to the ""thing-in-itself."" (350-351)</p>
<p>* But this was the weak point. Because Kant had here laid out a situation in which a ""Verbindungsform"" (namely the relationship of our though to the empirical world), which he himself had understood to be subjective, stood as the basis upon which to establish the existence of the thing-in-itself. And this was thent he point of attack for opponents of Kant who then argued that it was ""inadmissable"" by means of sensory impressions to establish a causality that leads to the ""Real"". (""dass es unstatthaft sei aus ser Dinnesempfindung vermittlest der Causalität das an sich Realze abzuleiten.) And then from here they drew the conclusion that the real consequence of transcendental philosophy was that sense ipressions are entirely subjective. And this conclusion was the ""Ausgangspunkt"" for the entirely following development of idealistic philosophy.&nbsp; (351)</p>
<p>* And this led also to the stand point of what ""theoretical egoism"" (??) that developed among Kant's followers and most famously Fichte. Fichte's point of view was that one could only take up one form of indepedent being, either that of the subject or that of the subject, and not an autonomy that is changing and based on both (""nicht aber eine wechselweise Selbstätigkeit beider.""). (352) To build a subject on the objective world corresponded for him to matieralism, and yet this point of view made it impossible to explain consciousness (Bewusstssein) and knowledge (Erknenntniss). And yet on the other side it was already clear in Kant's categories and in the paralogisms (???) that the empirical world is only accessible if one moves from the subject outward and does not leave the self. But Fichte, he notes, put postitively what Kant put negatively. Kant said:</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>But Fichte put this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style=""color: #3e454c; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 15.3599996566772px; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: pre-wrap; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: #dbedfe;"">Sowie das Ich nur für sich selbst sei, ensteht ihm zugleich notwhendig ein Sein auser ihm.</span> (quoted on 352)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>* He then has this excellent summary of different explanations of ""Vorstellung"" i.e. imagination or understanding. Sensualism he says saw Vorstellungen as the effect of the objects. Transcendental philosophy saw it as the product of the thing-in-itself and the form of our intellect. Theoretical egoism saw it as the consequence of the subject. All three he says make the same mistake that they imagine that they could establish an absolute relation between the subject and the object. (352)</p>
<p>* But here is where Schopenhauer came in, noting the unresolvable causal link between subject and object, and he then rethinks Vorstellungen as that experience of the subjet wherein that relation between subject and object is totally decomposed, so that Vorstellungen has two parts, subject and object. But for Schopenhauer this leads to a relativity of the world as imagination/understanding. His phrase was ""diese gänzliche und durchgängige Realtivität der Welt als Vorstellung."") (353) So for Schopenhauer there is really no true reality that is not divided into these two broken parts, the subject and object. So that he's not convinced of the existence of the object, like Ficthe, or the subject! And in this way he says Erscheinung is made into Schein, i.e. appearances into make-believe. (353). With Schopenhauer he ultimatelz says the concept of idealitaet has essentially posisted a second reality...and then in thi sway he suggests that transcendental idealism became something like a very dogmatic realism that had little relationship to the contents of the critique of reason (""einen sehr dogmatischen Realismus, der zum Inhalt der Venuftkritik keine wesentlichen Beziehungen mehr hat."")&nbsp; (353-4)</p>
<p>* So at this point he says it must seem as if, if one follows out this line of thought that Kant's critics traced, that the critique of reason with the teaching of the thing-in-itself (""Lehre von Ding an sich"") cancelled or overcame itself. That this whole structure, which Kant had intended as a bulwark against metaphysics, collapsed as soon as the metaphysical component was withdrawn.&nbsp; But this whole train of consequences (""Consequenzug"") itslef relies one conlusion/set of conclusions, the proof of yet has yet to be examined. So he wants now to examine that. (354)</p>
<p>* Now he traces this. Kant believed that you could not establish the form of concepts as something originating in the subject itself. This subjective element was not sufficient (""hinreichend"") to explain the fact of concepts. The explanation of of these concepts required the recognition of a sphere completely outside of the subjective sphere, the impact of which on the subject precipates the process that we call sensory perception (""Sinnesempfindung."")</p>
<p>* Now the post-Kantian philosophers saw the inadmissability of this derivation, and they argued that since sensory perception came just as little from a real world of ""things-in-themselves"" as from the objective world, it must therefore come be explainable through the subject. (353) He wants to hold off on whether this was a good understanding of the l aw of causation for the moment, and intead look at what warrants this conclusion (""Schluss""). (353-354)</p>
<p>* First he defines the point of view more carefully: My summary/translation: So the idea here was that thinking is a process that goes on totally within the subject, that it is a function of understanding ""Verstandnes"", and as such is something spwaned or generated ('hervorgebracht"") only in the subject and conditioned by the forms of thinking. And so also the forms of sensory impression (""Empfindung"") are based entirely in the chracter/nature of the subject. So that all that is in the Subject that has being has its origin in the nature of the subject, and that all that in sensation is not fixed but has a changing content ('wechselnder Inhalt"")&nbsp; also has its origin entirely within the subjective domain. (this whole summary on the top of page 355).</p>
<p>* Then he goes into a long two page story involving a quoation from Kant in which Kant describes how we could imagine that the world was so constituted that we never really saw the sun, and so that the change from day to night would be understood without the rise of the sun.&nbsp; And in this case, in this ""situation of things"" (""Zustand der Dinge"") it is possible that the philospher might never intuit the existence of the sun because it isn't really a thing, but in fact it is still possible through the acceptance (""Annehmung"") of a hypotheses from some cloud body such a phenomenon to explain. (355) Then Lehmann works through this example in a bit more detail over the next few pages (355-357). What he concludes is that in this case the best the kind of knolwedge that is arrived at is really just a kind of analogical conclusion (""Analogienschüsse"") and thus&nbsp; it is in the best case a mere probability (""blosse Warscheinlichkeit""). So this is I think a way of playing out starting with a statement from Kant the post-Kantian idea that perhaps our sensory perception and our concepts originate in the subject, and the result he finds is that this is just probability, not real knowledge.</p>
<p>*But then he says, well, maybe this isn't really what the idealists were arguing at all. Maybe their point was really that our sensory perceptions do not originate from the objective world or from the subjective. This it seems is the line where idealism just appears to lead straight to a total illusionism, as his Hartmann had said : ""die streng logische Consequenz jeses erkenntnisstheoretischen Idealisms der absolute Illusionismus"" sei."" (358).</p>
<p>* He goes through this a bit vv Fichte, and then on 359 says that really idealism has a lot in common with realism (here I think he means those who see sensory perception and subjectivity as determined by the object): both he says make use of a false law of causation. So he's pushing away (in a way typical of neo-Kantians) from both a pure realism and a pure idealism. Both he thinks do not emerge necessarily out of the critique of reason. (see 358 - 359).</p>
<p>* But then he wants to raise a doubt. Given that both the post-kantian idealists, and in fact Kant himself recognized this contradiction or inconsistency: i.e. the difficulty of building a bridge between subject and object. Is there then a hidden cause here that explains somehow why the idealist philosphy and its set of conclusions become so widely recognized? (""Sollte hier nicht noch ein Grund verborgen sein, der es, wenn nicht berechtigt so doch yum mindesten begrieflich erscheinen lässt, dass das grössere Recht der idealistischen Schlussfolgerung so allgemein anerkannt worden ist?"" (359) His answer is that if we look at the motives of the idealists that yes there is such a cause or reason, but it is a historical one and not a factual ""sachlicher"" one. (359)</p>
<p>* When Fichte tried to establish the forms of connection and conception out of the nature of the subject, he was directly contradiction Kant, who had clearly stated that this was not possible. Yet Kant (""der Vernunftkritiker"") did not link sensory perception fo the subject because he had linked sensory perception to the thing-in-itself. That is, it was Kant himself who provided the impetus (""Anstoss"") for idealism because he himself stepped over the limits of knowledge (""Grenzen der Erkenntniss.""). (360)</p>
<p>* The key part here in Kant's thought was his ""trascendentl deduction of the the categories."" Here he attempted to show how the Categories, these a priori concepts that could be grasped or conceived out of the world of objects (""Gegastaende""), also were useful and valid pure concepts of understanding that derived from the fudnamental nature of human kowledge and understanding. In order to establish this, Kant had to dissect Erfahrung/experience into its three elements: intuition (Anschauung), the Categories (Kategorien), and self awareness (Selbstbewusstsein). So he creates a whole new theory of experience, which he then names ""transcendental"" and sets it against the notion of ""empirical deduction"" and also he identifies its purpose using the definition that in the introduction to the critique of reason he defined as transcendental, namlely that they can prove how are concepts of objects are a priori.</p>
<p>I think what Lehmann is getting at here is what Scott Edgar in his article ""The Limits of Experience and Explanation: F.A. Lange and Ernst Mach on Thigns In Themselves"" as one of the key problems in Kantian philosophy that the neo-Kantians never resolved. The problem was that they wanted to believe (with Kant) that things in themselves could be inferred as the cause of our sensations, as the reason we have sensations in the first place. On the other hand, they also believed that our concept of cause itself is itself pscyhologically conditioned. These two ideas contradicted each other. If causality is a subjective thing, then we cannot say that our sensations are caused by things in themselves.</p>
<p>Lehmann does not say this specifically but it seems as though he is working through the same issue. His point is that the post-Kantian opponens of Kant noted this problem.</p>
<p>* Then on 362 he says, though, thtat the problem with the post-Kantian critics was that they only saw that contradiction in the chapter on Phenomena and noumena, and they failed to realize that the same contradiction is wrapped up with the deduction of the Categories ( as I thin he showeed on 360 in his discussion of Kant that is so hard to read). Instead they simply adopted the idea and enlarged it like Fichte, or they tried to supersede or replace it with a simplyer and more natural scientific and more valid although still problematic like Schopenhauer did. (362, first paragraph).</p>
<p>* What Schpenahuer did he says was to just saz that the relation between subject and object had nothing to do with the principle of causation. (""dass zwischen Subject und Object gar kein Verhaeltniss nach dem Satz vom Grunde stattfindet."", Schopenhuaer quoted on 362)&nbsp;&nbsp; But to do this Schopenhauer had to work with the same inconsistency as Kant, or what he defined as the apriority of the casuality principle ""Aprioritaet des Causalitaetsbegriff"" (Schopenhauer quotedon 362), i.e. that it was known apriori.</p>
<p>* Now here he make an interesting jump. What Schopenhauer ultimately points to is the way our conception fo causality is significantly intuitited through knowledge that is the result of impression of the real world. As he puts it: ""dass schon yur Bildung unserer Anschaungen das Causalitaetsgesetz ein wesentlicher Factor ist, dass nach seinem eigenen Ausdruck 'die Anschauung der wirklichen Welt durchaus Erkenntniss der Ursaache aus der Wirkung ist'"" (362, bottom). But this idea has been confirmed mostly, he says, by empiricical research from the last decades -- that he calls brilliant and pleasing -- but which h e says confiirmed the transcendental knowledge much less than it confirmed the Kants deduction of the categories. (362-363) It seems here that he is speaking of empirical psycyhological research, but we shall see.. In any case, he know literally speaks of the ""Schopenhaurisch derivation of the outer world out of sensory perception"" and says that Schopenhauer attempted to ""base causality not only consistently on the latter [the sensory perception of the outer world], but in fact also the perception not simply as a process of understanding, but as an excitement of the sensory organs, and established this as ""real."" (""Den diese Schopenaur'sche Ableitung der Aussenwelt aus der Sinnesempfindungen und der Kategorie der Causalitaet begruendet sich nich nur durchgehends auf diese letztere, sondern fasst auch die Empfindung selbst nicht als Vorgang im Verstande, sondern als Erregung der Sinnesorgane, setzt somit auch diese als real voraus."" (363) Then he says it explicitly that Schopenhauer's intervnetion here was ""significant"" (""bedeutungsvoll"") for empirical pscyhology as well as for the psychology of sensory organs, but he repeats what was validated here was not the transcendental nature of experience. But rather <br /><br /></p>

Lost Manhood Found: Male Sexual Impotence and Victorian Culture in the United States,"p. 37 -  19th Century: Separation of sexuality and reproduction 

Over nineteenth-century things shift.  Advertisements move toward cures for impotence, things designed to ""increase desire""  or ""cures sexual weakness."" (37)

Mumford links this to a ""historical separation of sexuality from reproduction."" (37)  This the resultsof rising use of abstinence, contraception, abortion by northern middle-class whites, who ""cut their rate of fertility y half."" (37) 

Out of this came also a new moral distinction by Protestants between sex for reproduction and sex as expression of romantic love. (37)   This further produced new focus on non-procreative sexual acts, e.g. the works of physician Benjamin Rush or reformer Sylvester Graham.  They are asking about the conseuqnces of nonreproductive sexual activity.  Imagine it can causes ""debility"" a depletion of the nervous system.  Rush formulated this as being caused either by too little or too much stimulation.  (38)  This new ""scientific conception"" of impotence, linking sexual activity to physical and nervous debility formed between 1810-1850 by Rush, Graham and frenchman an dphysician Claude-Francois Lallemand. (38-39)

Thisconception of debility is also linked to the movement of young men to the city.  (39-40)"
A history of experimental psychology,"<p># Edwin Boring, *A History of Experimental Pscyhology* (New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, c1950, originally published 1929)</p>
<p>&gt; Note Sesssion 10/12: Reading for Mainfold Origins Project, trying to understand what Paul Guyer called the ""pscyhological aesthetics"" of Fechner, and also trying to get a better sense of the psychological roots of neo-Kantianism in say Helmholtz.</p>
<p>## Ch. 13 German Pscyhology before 1850: Kant, Herbart, and Lotze</p>
<p>* German pscyhology and the ""new psychology"" rooted somehow in Leibnitz. Boring doesn't specify how here. (246)</p>
<p>* Kant: Kant had been a discipline of Leibnitz and his interpreter Chrstian Wolff. (247) His effect on pscyhology Boring says was 1) that he ""favored *subjectivism*, keeping alive the aith in the importance of thosem ental phenomena which can not be reduced to brain or body processes."" (247) and 2) he supprted *nativism* in theories of space: ie that space and time are *a priori* intutitions and not properties of the external world. (247) Kant was trying to reach a compromise of sorts between Hume's skepticism and Berkeley's nominalism. Boring says ""He undertood to place the contributions of the mind intheir proper sphere over against the things-in-themselves, those 'outside' object which the mind can never know directly."" (248) His *categories* were furnished by the mind in making sense of the data of expereince; he named 12 categories for instance unity, totality, reality, existence, necessity, and so on. And he treated space and time as <em>Anschaung</em>, frequently translated as intutition, but themeaning better communiactd with the German word because it ""implies that the spatial arranement of objects is given in perception."" (248) Finally, Boring says that what Kant was doing was ""re-estabilshing Cartesian *dualism* for pscyhology,"" which had been threatened by British empiricism. He sees Kan't sinfluence as making it ""natural"" for Herbart, Fechner and Wundt to ""take the mind for granted"" and to set up experimetnal pscyh as an attempt to ""systemize itself as a science of consciousness."" Elsewhere in France and America it was easier he thinks for psychology to become ""objective.""&nbsp; Kant's *nativism* also very influential (249)</p>
<p>* Herbart: Herbart was following up more directly on Leibnitz than Kant. He had been influenced by Kant as a young man but rejected his doctrines in his doctoral degree in Goettingen. Herbart then took Kant's chair in Koenigsberg in 1890 (Kant died in 1809). His pscyhology: he denied that pscyhology was an experimental science; instead, he deemed it a science grounded in math and metaphysics. That is, he also saw philosophy and metaphysics as wihtin the purview of<em> *</em>Wissenschaft*. (251) It's basis in metaphysics and in mathetmatics is what made pscyhology distinct from physics, which was an experimental science in his view. (252) Herbart's pscyhology was however mechanisistic. (253) Herbart' sbasic unit was the idea or *Vorstellung*. Ideas had an intensity or force (*Kraft*) that had to do with their clearness. Ideas also strove to preserve themselves; that is, they are also active in his conception. And they can be ""inhibited."" He wrote: ""Every movement of ideas is confined between two fixed points: their state of complete inhibition, their state of complete liberty."" (quoted&nbsp; on 255). Due to this conception of ideas as active, Boring says ""Herbart is seen to be a dynamic psychologist, ftting into a line of successino from Leibnitz to Freud."" (255) Herbart's notion of inhibition was key because it began a ilne of thinking about the ""unconscious."" For Herbart, ideas were not destroyed by being inhibited. They just ceased to be a reality and became instead a tendency. He also posited the idea of a ""limen of conscisouness""; thatis, a ""limit that an ideas seems to overleap in passing from a state of complete inhibition to a state of real idea."" (quoted on 256) All this gives a picture of the mind that Boring describes: ""It is plain that the composition of consciousness at any moment si the resultant of the mechanical interplay of many ideas. Of all those ideas below the limen, only those taht fit in with the unity of consciousness find so little resistance that they can rise above. Thus we have the appearance of the conscious idea of 'selecting' from amon thsoe that are unconscious the ones taht are consontant with thesmelves."" (256) Here Herbart uses the Leibnitzian concept of *apperception*: an idea that rises to consciousness for Herbart, as with Leibntiz, is *apperceived*. Apperceiving is the rising to consciousenss of an idea as well as its ""assiimialtion to ta totality of consciouss ideas, which Herbart called the 'apperceiving mass.'"" (257) Based on all this Boring states that ""Liebnitz foreshadowed the entire doctrine of the unconscious, but Herbart actually began it."" (257)</p>
<p>** Skpped the section on Lotze **</p>
<p>## Ch. 14 Gustav Theodor Fechner</p>
<p>* Fechner, Boring wants us to understand, gave birth to the ""embryo"" of experimental pscyhology. It was not all new because there had been born already a pscyhological physiology in Johannes Mueller and E.H. Weber. And a philosophical belief in a physiological psychology: Herbart, Lotze. (275)</p>
<p>* Fechner's contribution, according to Boring, was primarily in devising new methods for measuring in experimentation. (293) and in his formulation of psychophysics as a science as ""an exact science of the functional relaations or the relations of dependency between body and mind."" (quoted on 286)Theidea came out in his *Elemente der Pschyhophysik*. (282, 286) Boring notes that Fechner also founded ""experimental esthetics"" in his *Vorschule der Aesthetik*. This was the b""beginnign of the use of the mthod of impression in the experimental study of feeling and estehtics."" (282)</p>
<p>* Boring goes into detail on Fechner's pychophysics after 284. It was a lot of equations that I don't think I need to follow. But equestions!! that being the point. He also note that Fechner's also distinguished between inner and outer psychophysics. Inner psychophysiscs was more on ""inner psychophysics"" that is ""the relation between mind and excitation mot immediate to it""&nbsp; (292) Outer pscyhophysics dealt more with the relation between mind and stimulus.</p>
<p>## Ch. 15 Hermann von Helmholtz</p>
<p>* Helmholtz was born in Potsdam in 1821. His main contribution was not necessarily to psychology. His greatest contribution was in the ""experimental pscyhology of sensation"" that he prenseted in *Optik*. (302) Theother important work is *Tonempfindungen*. Boring says that the impact of the publiication of thse books in the 1860s was bery big. Boring puts it this way: ""Fifty years before, physiologists had much to say about vision and hearing, the hsitoric sensses which Newton discussed, and little abut the other senss. Then E.H. Weber wrote the first thoroughgoing psychophysiology of the cutaneous and other bodily sesnes (1834, 1846). Now Helmholtz, like Newton in having the physicist's point of view but writing when the meaning of psychology was becoming a little more obvious, was placing vision and hearing again in the van among the senes about which enough was known to permit the writing of scientific texts. Fechner showed the psychology could employ the scientific method of measurement. Helmholtz showed what could be done in research and in the accumulation of facts in the two leading sense-departments. the movemnt toward a pscyhological science was already under way."" (303)</p>
<p>* Helmholtz, Boring notes importantly, was still someho wnot an experimetnal psychologist because he ""thought of psychology as essentially physiological, and of physiology as essentially physical."" (303) He saw pscyhology in other words as an exact science rooted in math. (303)</p>
<p>* Because of this empirical-experimental focus, Helmholtz stands more closely to the British empriicists than to the German one that extends fro Liebnitz, to Kant, to Fichte. (304) Helmholtz ultimately then rejected the tendency in this line to believe in intutitionism, aka the doctrine of innate ideas, or a prior judgements or native categories of understanding. (304) Later this became a conflict between geneticism (those who rejected intutitionism) and nativism (those who accepted it). That is, Helmholtz, Lotz, and Wudnt against Hering Mueller and Stumpf. (305)</p>
<p>[Note: this is where we can begin to see the start of the specifically neo-Kantian forumlation, a desire to ground mind in a scientific account of human physiology...??]</p>
<p>* Helmholtz rejected the doctrine of ""nativism"" -- the idea that space and time are native to our perception -- which is linked with Kant and which Ficthe had also made central to his philosophy. Boring quotes Helmholtz at length on 305 in his rejection of that theory, and the description of his alternative: the <em>empiristic theory</em>. The basic idea was in Helmholtz words that ""no other forces are necessasry for their origin beyodn the known faculties of our minds, even though these forces themselves may remain entirely unexplained."" (305) What this meant essentially is that the axioms though which we perceive are themselves products of our experience. E.g. Helholtz thought that ""sphere-dwellers"" would have differen geometric axioms since for them for example the axiom of parallels would not hold because any two straight lines would necessarily converge at some point. (306)</p>
<p>* Helmholtz also had a notion of the ""unconciousns"" that was the doctrine of unconscious inference (*unbewusster Schluss*). Boring explains this as having two key ideas: 1) that ""perception may contains many experimental data that are not immediately represented in the stimulus"" and 2) that ""these aspects of the perception that do not immediatley represent the stimulus are, in a sense, additions which accrue to the preception in oaccordance with its development in past experience."" Ie these are ""inferences"" that are however unconcious. Boring provides a quote from *Optik* describing the idea on 309.Boring then describes the parts of this idea in detail on 310 and 311.</p>
<p>* Perception. Helmholtz distinguished between a sensory pattern that is based entirely on the ""stimulus-object"" , which he called Perzeption and thought very rare, between experiences of things that are mixed with an ""imaginal incredment, dependent upon meory and induced by unconsiocus inference, which he called *Anschauung*, and finally impressions totally disconnected from stimulus from outside = *Vorstellung*. (312) Here Helmholtz like Mill and those before him want to say something about the ""object."" For Helmholtz the object was ""nothing more than an aggregate of sensations, an aggregate which has been formed in experience because the sensations ahbitually occur together, and which is not analyzed into its sensory constituents except by a special act of attention.""

Beyond Separate Spheres: Intellectual Roots of Modern Feminism,"p.082 Thompson does not pursue career

While there was a possiblity that Thompson might have found a job, in the

Histories of the Other,"[Summary Note]
Hegeman reviews two histories of Americanist anthropology.  She generally likes Patterson's book more than Darnell's because Patterson examines the history of anthropology in terms of its relationship to and implication in U.S. history.  His study i.e. is ""situated squarely within both the larger social and cultural concerns of the US and the institutiosn and funding soruces the allowed the disicpline to flourish.""  
By constrast, Darnell's study is less to Hegeman's liking because it is less focused on contextualizing anthropology in relation to U.S. history as it is in examinging the Boasians and less so their broader context in order to use them to ""assert the continuites that exist in the project of North American anthropology...""  I.e. the Boasians are ancestors, and as Hegeman divines partly her historiographical agenda is to use disciplinary history to ""correct the tendency among anthropologists to emphasize the theoretical and topical novelty of their current research at the expense of historical self-awareness and contextualization."" (628)  In particular, she's trying to work against the reflexive anthropology of the mid-1980s assocaited iwth aworks like Marcus and Fischer, Anthropology as Cultural Critique or Clifford and Marcus, Writing Culture who focused on writing practices of anthropologists, their connections to quesitons of power an dauthority, the status of ethnographic knowledge, and relationship of anthropology to other genres such a autobiography, memori, travel narrative, etc etc.  She tries to show that the Boasians too were concerned with these problems and dabbled in similar experiments, and then accusses the reflesive anthropologist of the mid-1980s with ""postmodern nihilism.""  (629)  For Darnell, the most experimental of the anthropologists is Sapir.  (629)
Besides the larger criticism, Hegeman points out that one signficant problem with Darnell's analysis is that she glosses over the different nature of the mid-1980s anthropological project and the Boasians'.  She takes Hegeman to be saying that the Boasians were ""moral relativists"" and agrees with her, but Hegeman wants to distinguish between moral relavtivism and epistemologcial relativism whcih was the concern of the mid-1980s reflexive anthropologists. (630).  She notes how this emerges in Darnell's analysis in particular in her analysis of Radin's Primitive Man as Philosopher (1927)...here the epistemolgocalo relativity was more present, but Darenll minimizes that aspect of the work and instead focus on the them of ""cross-cultural inquiry."" (631-2)
What however is most interesting about Hegeman's analysis is the way she situates her study.  She frames her discussion of the two books by the suggestion that discplines are like cultures.  That is just as anthropologists study others, so a historian studying anthropologist can be seen as studying an other.  These histories are doing just this, and her preference for Patterson's study is that he does not seek to artificially unify the discipline.  That is Patterson's study of the other may fit with the kind of anthropology that Hegeman prefers, that is one that does not attempt to reconstruct a unified and coherent culture of th eother, but demonstrates as she says of Patterson's study ""emphasizies a more contentious and complex history...[focusing] on the fact that anthropologists working in the US were citizens, patriots, radicals, conservatives, technocrats, bureaucrats, academics, and intellectuals.""

<p>And yet Sklansky notes that there were also ideas about common interest or good propounded in the Revolutionary Era that exceed thefocus on enlightened self-interest.  He cites Rev. Nathaniel Niles' ""Two Discourses on Liberty"" (1774).  Niles had orthrodox Calvinist view that that property was given to mankind commonly and then certain parts apportioned to different individuals.  But inusing this land these individuals should keep an eye on the good of the community.</p>
<p>Another more radical example: Joel Barlow,part of a literary circle known as the ""connecticut Wits"", served as epic poet and army chaplain in the War of Indepednece.  Barlow, like Niles, also ""suboridinated individual property rights to the supreme authority of society as a whole."" (27)</p>
<p><strong>Sklansky's point here is that ""[t]he revolutionary implications of natural right and social contract, both at the core of American political economy, appeared to lead him [Barlow] beyond the proprietarian premises of the classical social science itself."" (27)  And that ""the ideology of equal rights on the one hand and the identification of political rights with access to the means of production on the other fueled a growing struggle over social inequality.""

They note that the absence may have to do with ambivalence about women historians' own professional success.  ""...the failur eot tackle head-on hisotical issues in female professionalization may well reflect the ambivalence of women historians about the meaning and consequences of professionalism in their own personal lives.  In fact, the contemporary feminist push for professional opportunites has all the characteristics of a love-hate relationship.  Women rihglty demand equal access to and treatment in professiona life, yet when professional success arrives often question both the social relations and the values implied by their new status."" (276)  

It may also have to do with focus on writing history from the ""bottom up"" -- which has come from the Annales, E.P. Thompson and the ""new social history."" I.e. focus on working classes so as not to give women's history a Whiggish charater. (276)"
"Reading Obama: Dreams, Hope, and the American Political Tradition","<p>2. Chapter 1</p>
<p>* Kloppenberg thinks that Obama has the best grip on ""America's past than any president of the United States since Theodore roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson,"" i.e. Progressive Era presidents!  Is this really true? (2)</p>
<p>* K thinks that Obama's ideas have confused political observers beacuse they don't understand that he is a ""hybrid of old an dnew""--that his ideas are a prodcut of a deep engagement with American history and politics. So if we want to understand him then we have to understand ""how he sees the present in light of the past, and also how he envision the future in light of his own--and his nation's--place within a global community tht has undergone dramatic and unprecedented cultural transformations."" (3)</p>
<p>* K refers to Obama's December 9, 2009 Oslo Nobel speach where he refers to the fact that the rise of transnational institutions, human rights, and globalization has caused people to ""fear the loss of what they cherish in their particular identities,--their race, their tribe, and perhaps most powerfully their religion."" (3) K adds that this is a tension betweeen ""universal against particular""  which is ""the central dynamic of the twenty-first-century world."" (3)</p>
<p>* K thinks that Obama's first twoo books ""provide a blueprint for American politics."" (3)  Audacity of Hope he thinks ""provides a diagnosis of contemporary American problems and offers a roadmap of political possibilities.""  (7)</p>
<p>* In <em>Dreams</em> K notes Obama had originally thought to write about race relations in America, but he was then ""pulled toward rocker shores"" (Obama's words, 8).  He looked at the ""tangled roots"" of his own identity and what he found did not provide much consolation K says.  His look into his past provided no ""degree of stability, let alone tranquility."" (8)  ""Instead, both America and Africa presented endless challenges and puzzles, the 'rockier shores' on which his and his relatives' fantasies ran aground."" (8)  K writes nicely here on 8-9 about how O's questions upset his family narratives, created eddies and pools etc...and""undertwos taht upset his equilibrium, coplicated his own sense of self, and, even more treacherously, disrupted th epersonal and cultual narratives that had inspired him as a child."" (9)The book also is part memoir and by Obama's own indication a kind of ""mdiation on central themes of his life.."" (9)  This space between fiction and nonfiction reinforces the sense of instability and complexity in the self that is the main theme of the book. (9)\</p>
<p>--&gt;  Note: getting into discussion of Audacity, K refers to O on top of 10 as a ""progressive.""</p>
<p>* The experience of being stranded and uneasy also generated by his epxerience of politics as a community organizer wehre he found his own ideals ""bouncing off the hard surfaces of self-interest and political partisanship."" (10)</p>
<p>* K says he will put Obama's in two contexts ""in order to illuminate the cultural framework within which he came of age, the historical patterns that have shaped his sensibility.""  (10)  His story is an American tale on the one hand, K says, but also ""a journae lived at a time of deep cultural self-examination and contestation, w hen thinkers were seeking, finding, and then rejecting foundations of many different kinds."" (10)</p>
<p>* K traces Obama's experience growing up in Hawaii with white grandparents and how this led him to an awareness of the doubleness of his identity that K likens to that of the Ellison's <em>Inivisible Man </em>whose central character refuses to decline into despair.  (14-15) Obama instead realizes that the asnwer must lie in the transcendence of hatred.  But he was also isolated in this quest...he lived with a white family but because ""of his invisibility, Obama would never be known by whites as he could know them.  As he became aware of that condition, and his double consciousness, he began to understand his predicament.  Even though he was surrounded by a loving family, Obama 'realized for the first time taht I was utterly alone.'"" (16)</p>
<p>* Then at Occidental, Obama is exposed to the great political thinkers in a calss with the political scientsist Roger Boesche...O says in Audacity that he wanted to study political philosophy because he was ""looking for both a language and systems of action that could help build community and make justice real."" (quoted on 17).  Buty he struggled with the ""iconoclasm"" and waht K describes as ""valueless, post-Christian nihilism"" of thinkers like Weber and Nietzsche and then on the other hand the struggle to ""make justice real.""  <strong>This tension K argues was a key tension driving Dewey and James to formulate their philosophiacl pragmatism. (17)</strong>.  Obama was also exposed at Occidental to post-colonial and anti-imperial thinkers likes Frantz Fanon so that he could consider himself ""alienated from white America."" (18)  At Occidental he also began to develop an identity fro himself as a writer (19)  He also became more political and became involved in the ""Sotuh African devistment campaign and the Committee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador..."" (19)  He was not impressed when a friend of his declaered hereself not black but ""multiracial""; K writes: ""She was running away from the hard fact of race in America.  Whatever individuals might think of themselves, to whites they were black.  So was Obama..."" (19)  It was at this stage that friends began to call h a sign im Barak and not Obama, and he ""accepted it as a sign of his authenticity."" (19)  He was being pushed also by others to accept more respoinsibility.  A friend of his whom he calls Regina told him to take off the ""armor of uncertainty"" ""that shielded him from his fear that he berlonged to niether the black nor the white world."" (21)  And K writes he also felt he was being pushed by</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">""his teachers, his mother, his grandparents, by unknown people in South Africa, CEntral America, Indonesia, and across America forced to uendure poverty and injustice.  All were demanding more from him.   'They all asked the same thing of me, these grandmothers of mine.'  They asked just waht the grandfather in <em>Invisible Man</em> demanded.  theyw anted him not just to survive or endure, they demanded that he shoulder a burden that he did not ask for, but that feell to him nevertheless, a responsibility to affirm the principle.  But there was a problem.  Obama was attracted more to the questioners--to Emerson, Nietzsche, James, and Niebuhr--than to those with the dogmatic certainty animating political activists.  How could he reconcile his own dobuts with his grandmother's pleas?"" (22)</p>
<p>* At Columbia--an exchange with Occidental--Obama felt marginalized from student life at the College, was ""growing more attuned to the issues attracted student protests and tot eh problem of poverty that continued to plague American cities,"" (24) and also found that the radicalism associated witht he earlier generation of civil rights had in his words ""shattered into a thousand fragments."" (quoted on 24).</p>
<p>* He next goes to do commmunity organizing in Chicago's South Side.  He was 25 at that point.  He is recruited by Gerald Kellman to work in the Devloping Communities Project, which is an offshoot of the Calumet Community Religious Conference.  He learns community organizing techniqes from Kellman, from Mike Kruglik and Gregory Galuzzo.  According to Kruglick K says Obama's ""core beliefs"" were already formed at that point:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">...[he] knew from experience--and from reading St. Augustine and Niebuhr--that humans are prone to selfishness.  He knew that the promise of American demcoracy had been squandered by plutocrats and that progressive reformed has tried but failed to redeem it.  He knew that political ideas such as liberty, equality, and justice are always at risk because of the pervasiveness of evil and the tragic disconnect between noble intentions and unanticipated consequences.  He knew from Madison and Tocqueville that American politics begins with individual interest, and he knew from the <em>Federalist</em> and <em>Democracy in America</em> that democracy can work only if poeple create institutions, associations, and political strategies to transform self-interest into the public good.  He knew about affirming the principle, but he knew that a gulf separated individuals' existential choices from effective political mobilization. Obama arrived in Chicago with a mantra he said he had learned from Martin Luther King, Jr.: Love without power is mere sentimentality.  Power without love is dangerous.  Love plus power equals justice.  Obama wanted to learn how to do the sum....(26)</p>
<p>K says that this mantra was the same one taughtr by the ""father of community organizing,"" Saul Alinsky.  Obama learned a version of Alinsky'sp rinciples from Kellman, Kruglik and Galuzzo.  Alinsky's ideas came from his training with the Chicago sociologists Ernest Burgess and Robert Park, and from the idea of expanding John L. Lewis ' ""confrontational strategies"" to communities and not just the shop floor.  Lewis had used his ideas to build the Congress of INdustiral Organizations.  Alinsky saw these ideas could be used to empower communities.  K gives a description of the technique of an organizer that came from Alinsky and which Obama excelled at: a good organizer will not try to bend people's ideas to his interests, but ""takes the time to listen to many comments, rephrases questions, and waits until the indivdiuals in the group begin to see for themselves waht they have in common.  A skilled organizer then patiently allows the animating principles and the plan of action to emerge from the group itself."" (28)  Obama however was frustrated by organizers' distrust of politics and could not understand why ""alliances across denominational ines or racial lines proved so difficult to sustain."" (29)  K connects this to Madisons' frustration with ""factions."" (29)</p>
<p>* In an article entitled ""Why Organize? Problems and Promise in the Inner City"" published in <em>Illinois Issues </em>in 1988 Obama alid out a point of view that only ""a combination of electoral politics, economic development, and community organizing could address this multidimensional crisis...""  (32)  K says he advanced an argument similar to Tocqueville's: that ""[w]e must find a way to 'knit together the diverse interests' of people's 'local institutions.  This means bringing together churches, block clubs, parent groups and other institutions in a given community.'"" (32)   This had to be doen through public participation and so Obama wrote, again paraphrasing Tocqueville K says, that getting people involved inc ommon projects ""enbles people to break out of their crippling isolation from each other, to reshape their mutual values and expectation and rediscover the possibilities of acting collaboratively--the successful prerequisites of any successful self-help initiative."" (32-33)</p>
<p>* Obama had already joined Jeremia Wright's group when he wrote this article. (34)</p>
<p>* Obama's next movew as to go to law school.  He said he wanted to learn about ""''interest rates, corporate mergers, the legislative process'; about businesses and banks and real estate."" (36)</p>
<p>* From 37 to the end of the chapter, K goes deep into the intellectual climate at Harvard law school with the basic point of suggesting that it was dominated by a contemporary pragmatist philosophical approach to law--the latter day version of the legal philosophy of Louis Brandeis and Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. who ""believed that law is a product of history and culture, a set of rules designed to facilitate social interaction based on changing values and aspirations.  they denied that law rests on bedrock, a stable foudnation of unchanging principles.  But they disagreed with 'crits,' as the advocates of critical legal studies were called, abut the futility of trying to use the law as a lever for social change."" (39) The notion of a pragmatist  in law had become muddied since the time of Brandies and Holmes.  New Dealers usually saw themselves as descended from the pragmatists.  Subsequently some conservatives had begun to call themselves pragmatists--ie. Richard Posner who ""reasoned that if pragmatism destabilizes inherited truths, the ostensibly netural mechanism of the free market provides the best way to resolve the resulting confusion."" (40)  At the same time, some literary critics drawing on Derrida i.e. Stanley Fish studied law as a kind of literature.  Many ont he left ""considered both Posner's and Fish's hijacking of the term pragmatism a travesty, a repudiation of the egalitorian commitments and democratic activism of James, Dewey, and their folloewrs int he progressive and New Deal Coalitions."" (40)</p>
<p>K's point is that Obama found himself in the middle of these disputes when he entered Harvard Law School in fall of 1988.  Obama then worked first as a research assitant to Professor Laurence Tribe in 1988-1989, then served on the editorial board of thslslye HLR in 1989-1990, and finally was president of the HLR in 1990-1991.  During these years K argues the HLR reflected the intensity of these debates.</p>
<p>He notes that progressives in law also drew upon a new set of ideas comign out of American history and political theory known ""variously as civiv republicanism, communtiarianism, and deliberative democracy"" that transformed ""legal scholarship in the 1980s."" (41)    K writes: ""Legal scholoarls attracted to these ideas counterposed the importance of the public interest--a coneption of a shared, common good, emerging through the proess of lively debate between champions of competing point of view--to the ideas of both conservatives and radical lieftists of the Marxist and poststructuralist persuastions."" (41)  While some conservatives described the Constitution as having and original meaning"" and leftists ""dismissed the law as a tool of oppression used by rich whit e males to preserve their power,"" these thinkers put themselves betwen these poles.  Many of Obama's teachers at Harvard participated in these debates.  K also mentions Gordon Wood's <em>The Creation fo the American Republic, 1776-1787</em> as a key text here (published 1969).  He says</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">""Wood demonstrated convincingnly, through an exhaustive examiantionof the evidence, that the architects of the United States were animated by a passion for civi virtue as well as liberty. They not only sought independence from Britain to establish freedom for individuals; in addition, they prized equality and jsutice as the ends of government, and they framed the United States Constitution for the purpose.  Wood concluded his analysis by claiming that the promise of civic republicanism, which required individuals to balance self-interest against he interests of the community, was betrayed almost immediately by a rapacious individualism that quickly supplanted virtuous citizens' concern with the common good."" (42)</p>
<p>Woods' ideas and the growing lit on civic republicanism in the 1970s and 1980s seeped into other disciplines such as poli sci sociology, and law...meaning then also that conservatives ""had to reckon with new challenges"" when claiming the primacy of individual rights. (43) Added to the new understanding of civic republicanism, ther were other scholars that showed that John Locke was ""a more fervant Calviinst than he was a prophet of rights consciousness"" (43) and other scholars (social hsitorians) like Gary Nash, Alfred Young, Linda kerber and Mary Beth Norton showed that blacks, women, and poor whites played a key role in ""winning indepednence and creating a new nation."" (43) K sums up: ""The United States, according to his line of argument, was designed fromthe swtart to bea  democracy in which people would deliberate together to discover the meaning of justice and advance the common good..."" (43)</p>
<p>Obama encountered thi sfirst in Boesche's class at Occidental... These ideas were then strengthened, K argues, by his legal education.  He goes through HLR articles in the years that Obama was involved and finds a definnite preference for civic republicanism and deliberative democracy.  (44-55)  This was particularly the acse int he year that Obama headed the HLR.  K states this explicitly on 55: a ""persistent emphasis on the potential of philosophical pragmatism, civic republicanism, and deliberative democracy as the best methods for resolving differences during the year of Obama's presidency..."" (55)</p>
<p>Of particular interest is K's analysis of an article by Laurence Tribe entitled the ""The Curvature of Constitutional Space: What Lawyers Can Learn from MOdern Physics"" that appeared in November 1989 in HLR and in which Obama worked along with Tribe to write.  The article is based on the principle that the law must first protect the intersts of the least advantaged and then on the idea that law is not rooted in an ""Achimedian point.""  It encoruaged lawyers to examine the ""'social meaning of what the state has done,' because 'the state enacts an image of order' that is coercive.  In other words, it inevitably curves the space around it."" (61)  Another book published by Tribe and Dorf i n1991, <em>On Reading the constitution</em>, further indicated the influence of philosophical pragmatism.  (62-63).  And K notes that Obama had already recived these ideas through Ralph Ellison's novel <em>Invisible Man </em>that he had read as a young man; through his encoutner with Alinsky's ideas (Alinsky had gotten it from Robert Park, see 65).</p>
<p>* Throughout this chapter, K refers to Obama's personal capacity and predilection for a kind of compromise and deliberation and problem solving that mirrors the philosphical pragmatism that he was being exposed to.  E.g. p.74-75; p.57 when he describes why Tribe selected Obama to help him with the article; p.48-49 when he describes how Obama's letter to HLR helped resolve a debate about affirmative action... and so on.</p>
<p>* After law school, Obama continues to pursue these concersn through the Saguaro Seminar that dealt with some of the issues surroudning how to incraese public engagement that Obama had identified in ""Why Organize"" in 1988.  (73-78)</p>
<p>* Ultimately K's point is: ""To understand Obama's attitude toward American politics and his long-term commitment to breaking the logjam of American party politics, it is not enough to trace his sensibility to his formative years in Indonesia and Hawaii; to Los Angeles, New York and Cambridge; to Illiinois and Keny.  It is equally crucial to locate him within the frameworks of civic republianism and communitarian discourse, within the tradition of philosophical pragmatism, and in relation to the cluster of complex ideas that emerged in the 1960s and 1970s."" (78)  By the latter, he his rferring to antifoundationalism, particularism, perspectivalism, and historicism... (78)  Obama encountered them first in his own life having to cope with ""the contrast between the attitudes of his mother and his stepfather while living in Indonesia."" (79)  Then as a lawyer and political activist.  <strong>""Whereas many Americans are upset--disoriented--by the idea that values vary over time and across cultures, Ovbama found that way of thinking congenial because it made bretter sense of his own experience, conformed to his emerging understanding of American democracy,a nd gave him valuable tools for daling with the philosohpical and political puzzles he was trying to solve.""

Uncertain Victory: Social Democracy and Progressivism,"<p>Notes Feb 2012 // For Pragmatism Course:</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>* Kloppenberg is trying to examine a ""transatlantic community of discourse in philosophy and political theory.""&nbsp; (3)</p>
<p>* He wants to clarify with this work the ""philosophical origins of social democratic and progressive theory"" which he thinks ""remain obscure"" compared to the well worked out ""chains linking Marxism to idealism and liberalism to empircism..."" (3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result he says these traditions of social demcoratic and progressive thought ""which diverged from the socialist and liberal traditions twoard the end of the nineteenth century, appear to be simply unstable accomodations to the new realities of organized capitalism in an urban-industrial environment."" (3)</p>
<p>* He tihnks that these were not just ""ideological expressions prssend into service to ratioanlize politically attractive positions"" but they were ""elaborated, extended, and applied ideas about knowledge and responsibility articulated by a generation of renegade philosophers."" (3)</p>
<p>* These ""renegade philosophers"" he also calls the philosophers of the <em>via media</em> who were searching for alternatives to the ""idealist and naturalist philosophies"" that dominated nineteenth century thought.&nbsp; They were Wilhelm Dilthey, Thomas Hill Green, Henry Widgwick, Alfred Fouillee, William James, and John Dewey.&nbsp; What held this thinkers together?&nbsp; He explains here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They denied both mind-body and subject-object dualisms inherited from Descartes, and they considered both passive sensations and active decision essential and inseparable aspects of experience.&nbsp; Knowledge, from their perspective, can neither be abstracted from nor entirely reduced to the historical circumstances of individual lives.&nbsp; Truth must be cut free from notions of eternity and necessity and grounded instead in human experience, never definite and subject always to revision.&nbsp; These mavericks insisted that ideas emerge from, and must be validated in, neither language nor logic but life.&nbsp; Theirs was a profoundly historical sensibility, imbued with the belief that meaning is woven into the fiber of experience, that becoming rather than being is the mode of human life, and that people make rather than find their values. (4)&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kloppenberg calls this ""cluster of ideas"" a ""radical theory of knowledge"" because it substituted an acceptance of contingency for certainty in epistemology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>* In the realm of ethics, he says, the revised both Kantian and utilitarian models ""by recognizing rules and results as complementary in moral reasoning.""&nbsp; (4) He thinks that Sidgwick in his <em>Methods of Ethics</em> elaborated these ideas most clearly and he will call this ethical theory an ""ethics of rational benevolence."" (4)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* The political writings of these thinkers he says lack the ""acuity"" of their other work. He suggest that they were ""left behind"" when Germany, France, England and the United States ""reconstitued themselves as urbanized and mechanical nation states."" (4)&nbsp; They had matured prior to the 2nd industrial revolution.&nbsp; He says they were consumed by an awareness of the incompatabiltiy of the older set of values for new new economic and sociopolitical cirucmstances, and yet they were consumed by certain anxieties about the new age.&nbsp; And ulimtastely they failed to outline an alternative.&nbsp; See description of alternatives on 5, top of page.&nbsp; Very good!</p>
<p>* It was a set of thinkers who emerged twenty years later that would do that: he menas the progressive and social democratic thinkers of the 1890-1920 period.&nbsp; These were English Fabians Beatrice and Sidney Webb, German revisionist Eduward Bernstein, French socialist Jean Jaures, and the prominant radical sof the American social gospel movement, Richard Ely and Walter Rauschenbusch.&nbsp; What tied these thinkers together he seems to think was a bit less coherent and differetn in each national context (think of Rodgers) but consisted of 1) a siimilar location of the foundation of knowledge in experience and a tendency to see history as a better source of judgement than ideology: 2) a desire to extend the principles of democratic equality to the social and economic spheres from the civic and political; 3) they championed gradual reform rather than revolution; 4) they ""although they embraced socialism as an ideal, they emphasized he connection between their goal and the means necessary for its realization, and for that reason they concentrated more on proximate reforms than on ultimate ends."" (6)</p>
<p>* His motivation for examining these political theorists is to ""disconnect their ideas from certain developments [in the welfare state] they could neither anticipate nor prevent.""&nbsp; (5)&nbsp; Ie he wnats to salvage the coherence of their vision from the critiques of those who point out the misshaped&nbsp; nature of various welfare states, which are the result of the missue or misunderstanding of these ideas.&nbsp; (5) So this is in part an act of ""reovery"" as he calls it on 6.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. Radical Theory of Knowledge</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I. Immediacy of Lived Experience</p>
<p>* The philosophers of the via media rejected traditional philosphy's ""search for apodicticity..."" (65)&nbsp; Rejected&nbsp; Cartesian mind-body dualism and ""acknoowledged the continuity of consciousness, the experience of freedom, and the provisional quality of the self."" (65)&nbsp; Knowledge as an undending experiment.&nbsp; etc etc.</p>
<p>"" Key here was a understanding that traditioanl epistemological questions were wrongly configured.&nbsp; They denied the ""ontological gap"" that was tradtionally understood to distinguish subject from object, mind from body.&nbsp; Those dualisms, they argued, were simply based in the differences between consciousness, lived experience (Dilthey), pure experience (James) etc, and what was beyond consciousness , ie ""everything that we do not experience from the inside.&nbsp; (65)&nbsp; Ie what existing philosphers had treated as a real difference, they argued was based in a miscontrual.&nbsp; In rejecting the mind-body dualism, they were esse ntially saying that reality wasa not broken into two parts, but instead that it ""merely yields different answers to questions posed from different perspectives.&nbsp; The world of our immediate experience appears to us different from everything else merely because we are inside it, not because it is metaphysically or ontologically distinct from the rest of existence."" (65)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* James' <em>Principles of Psychology </em>K describes as a first ""faltering step"" in the direction of ""ideas that integrated their isnights into the unity of subject and object in expeirence with their argument that valid knowledge could be derived from nature and from lived experience.""&nbsp; (67)&nbsp; He is work tried to balance a faithfulness to science and to ""lived experience"", but threatened to pull&nbsp; them apart.&nbsp; James kept in view here both a materialist sense of scientific causality, but allowed also for consiousness.&nbsp; He wrote: ""We may fairly write the Universe in either way, thus: ATOMS-producing-consciousness; or CONSCIOUSNESS-produced-by-atoms.&nbsp; Atoms alone, or conscoiusenss alone, are precisely equal mutilations of the truth."" (quoted on 67).&nbsp; Then also he was trying to balance a rejection of absolute idealism with view that could see the real expeirence of non-materialistic things.&nbsp; (67-68)</p>
<p>* Psychology was useful to James and also Fouillee, who both followed each other's work, because as Fouillee put it, ""Psychology is the only science of initial and immediate experience...whcih begins with what is given without postulates...""&nbsp; ie it begins with what is given.&nbsp; (69)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Between 1895-1896, James began to reject the notion of consciouesness (ie after finishing his <em>Psychology</em>) and experimented with other words, finding utlimatel the word ""field"" to be useful. He liked it because it avoiided the dualism and ""skirted the equally misleading notions of consciosuness as eithe rpure ego or material substance."" (69)&nbsp; This focus on consciousness as a field James admitted ""results in an almost maddening restlessness,"" but he believed K writes that it was a way back to ""concreteness.""&nbsp; The key principle was that in this context of the field of pure experience one could focus on what we mean by knowing and the principle of truth this tended to genereate was that ""nothing is postulated whose nature is not fully given in experience terms..."" (69)</p>
<p>II. Consciousness of Continuity and the Continuity of Consciousness</p>
<p>* So these philosophers of the via media denied the idea of atomism--ie that the mind experiences distinct bits of information and then combines them internally.&nbsp; Their idea waws instead that we ""experience relations"".&nbsp; But if so, are these ""elements of expeirence combined orginally and immediately in and by consciousenss, or are relations instead outside of us and an integral feature of the reality we experience? "" (73)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* K says that Dewey, Fouillee and Dilthey combine T.H. Green and James' ideas.&nbsp; Green's focus was on ""the role of consciousness in relating th various aspects of experience"" and James' was the notion of ""stream of consciousness"",which K describes as b eing about the ""relatedness of experience"" itself.&nbsp; (73)&nbsp;</p>

Jameson serious about the professional classes tranformation of historical scholarship.  Zealous about German methods.  Wrote a lot as a young man and then quit history at 40 (may have been due to feeling of inadequacy).  But also a result of his sense that the period did not suit the ""great individual"".

(22) He had been head of AHR and Historical Manuscripts Commission while at Brown.  But needed more insittutional support to achieve advances in documenation and bibliography.

Cosmopolitics: Thinking and Feeling Beyond the Nation,"<p># Bruce Robbins and Peng Chea (eds.), *Cosmopolitics: Thinking and Feeling Beyond the Nation*&nbsp; (Minneapolis: The University of Minnesota Press, 1998)</p>
<p>&gt; Note Session: I am reading this in order to get a sense of the recent take on cosmopolitanism. James Clifford said that it was the ""latest words."" Of course, he's quoted in the book.</p>
<p>## ""Introduction Part I: Actually Existing Cosmopolitanism"" by Bruce Robbins</p>
<p>"" I didn""t read this essay very closely as I found it kind of shallow and loosely worded. The best point I thought came in the first few pages where he tries to characterize a shift in th way we talk about cosmopolitanism. The key point was that the term is now associated with a ""new cast of characters."" (1) The&nbsp; ideas is that before it was linked with a list of people that quote Paul Rabinow from the <em>Writing Culture</em> book he describes as Jews, Christians, aristocrats, homosexuals etc, often as a way to denigrate such charachters. NOw it is associated more positively with ""North Atlantic merchant sailors, Caribbean au pairs in the United States, Egyptian gues workers in Iraq, Japanese <em>gaijin</em>lovers..."" (1) Here he quotes Clifford to say that the status of traveller should be given to the ""host of servants, helpers, companions, guides, beaers, etc."" (1) who made Victorian travel possible. (1)</p>
<p>* This ""change in personell"" (1) means a change in definition:</p>
<p>&gt;Understood as a fundamental devotion to the interests of humanity as a whole, cosmopolitanism has often seemed to claim universality&nbsp; by virtue of its independence, its detachment from bonds, commitments, and affiliations that contrain ordinary nation-bound lives. It has seemed to be a luxriously free-floating view from above."" (1)</p>
<p>It ist this view that is being rejected. He quotes several people here to get at what this means. The key people here: Rabinow, Arjudn Ap[padurai, Binata Parry, Arnold Krupat, DAvid Hollinger, and MItchell Cohen, Homi Bhaba, Anthony Appiah, and others. Basically, the point here is that the narrow definition of cosmopolitanism is not interesting. Their needs to be a focus on plural cosmopolitanisms that emerge in rooted contexts out of a reality of transnational mutual dependencies and connections produced by global capitalism, and which can in fact operate to support the state (see p.8). This implies what Robbins calls at one point ""the term's scaling down, its pluralizing and particularizing."" (3) He says it well again here: ""Another way to put the contrast is to say that instead of an ideal of detachment, actually existing cosmopolitanism is a reality of (re)attachment, multiple attachment, or attachment at a distance."" (3)</p>
<p>* Also key here to Robbins seems to be the way this cosmopolitanism is bound up with a critique of what he calls the ""romantic localism"" of parts of the left that ""feelts i t must counter capitalist globalization with a strongly rooted and exluvie sort of belonging."" (3)</p>
<p>## ""Introduction Part II: The Cosmopolitical--Today"" by Peng Cheah</p>
<p>* I found this essay a bit stronger out of the gate and throughout than Robbins, even as an introductory essay. He lays out the goal of the book much more clearly at the outset. Rigth off the bat he gives a descritpion of the recent cahnges that have made ""<em>globalization, transnationalism,, even postnationalism"" </em>keywords. These are summed up this way: ""the accelearated pace of globalization--the intesnsification of international trade, fiscal and technology transfers, and labor migration, and the consoliation of a genuiniely global mode of production trhough subcontracting--in 'advanced post-Fordsit' or 'late capltism,' the transnationalization of military commerical structures through NATO, and the rise of global hybrid cultures from modern mass migration, consumerism, and mass comunications in the past two decades have combined to create an interdependent world in which the nation-state faces imminent obsolence as a viable economic unit, a politcally sovereign territory, and abounded cultural sphere."" (20)</p>
<p>* BUT Cheah points out it is not clear what the laternvie are or whether they can be realized. And that is he thinks the point of the book: ""to explore the feasibility of coscmopolitanism as an alternative to nationalism in our contemporary area,..."" (21)</p>
<p>* He summarizies the perspectives taken in the book: 1) Allen Wood, Kwame Anthony Appiah, and Jonathan Ree he says make philosophical arguemnt ""for cosmpolitanism as an ideal project and a style of practical conscousness that overcomes nationalist particularism."" (21) 2) Louisa Schein, Bonnie Honig, Brucie Robbins, Scott Malcomson, and Aamanda Anderson focus on ""transcultural encounters, mass migration, and population transfers between East and West, First and Third Worlds, North and South."" (21) 3) Then there is Clifford, he says, who talks about ""discreptant cosmpolitanism"" and argues that cosmopolitanism is not longer ideal, but ""a vareity of actually existing practical stances."" (21) What unifies these accounts he says is a sense that ""contemporary transnationalism"" provides the ""material conditions for new radical cosmoplitanisms from below."" (21)</p>
<p>* In the next section, which I won't go into in detail he does a very useful analysis of Kant and Marx's take on cosmopolitanism. His points are historical. Kant he thinks was developiong a theory of cosmopolitanism at a time when nationalism as an ideology was not yet on the scene. His context was the ""interstate system of anarchy established by the Treaty of Westphalia after the breakup of the vast religious political communities of the medieval period."" (24) Interestingly, Cheah points out we might be able to see some links between that moment of interstate anarchy and the present 21st century state of the international system. (24) In any case, Kant's cosmopolitanism was then an attempt to set up a ""cosmopolitical right asserted in the name of a common humanity...to provide an ideal institutional framework for regulating the anarchic behavior of states."" (24)&nbsp; So his cosmopolitanism is not anti- or pro-nationalism. It is pre-nationalist, and an attempt to reform state absolutism. So it's not even an idel that suggests detachment from national entities. Rather it supports ""a form of right based on existing attachments that bind us into a collectivity larger that the state..."" This right can be asserted against the state because the states themselves, through commerce, an dieal that does not support war, involves a ""collectively"" in which states are already involved. (24)</p>
<p>* What Kant missed was nationalism, which Cheng explains also asserted certain ""rightful"" limits to state power. At this juncture, he notes wisely, the goals of European nationalism and cosmopolitanism are closely linked! He says ""indistinguishable"", which I think can't be right. But he has a good quote from Mazzini from 1861 that shows his point. (24-25)</p>
<p>* He also usefully points out that what he's talking about here is a point before the tightening of the hyphenated relationship of state and nation, where nationslim was more like cosmopolitanism. (25)</p>
<p>* Next he turns to Marx""s take on cosmopolitanism and nationalism. The historical point here is that Marx has seen the rise of nationalism, whereas Kant hadn't. So between 1795 when Kant wrote ""Perpetual Peace..."" and 1848 when Marx wrote the Communist Manifesto something had changed. He notes Marx""s ambivalenc eabout both cosmopolitnaism and nationalism. Cosmopolitanism was linked with the expanding global reach of bourgeois capital and exploitation, but it was also the condition for emancipation. Likewise, nationalism represented a kind of link to the land that was not just the subordination of land and labor to the rule of capital. So Chenge says he sees it something like religion as a false form of consciousness. (27) But in the end Marx dismisses nationalism and leans toward a cosmopolitanism of the worker, since the ""worker has no country."" (quoted on 28).</p>
<p>* Cheng thinks that Marx too easily equated natioanlism with the state, or rather that he linke dthe ideological content of nationalism too closely with the ""ecnonimc and cultural natinoalism of European states..."" (28) Cheng thinks he imagines the hyphenated relationship between nation and state to be immutable, whereas for Chenge it is not. He brings this up in the context of Marx's other failure--which he says was responsible for the falling apart of the Second International--and then he says that the most important reevaluations of Marx's theory here have come from the consideration of the anticolonial struggle. He finds Lenin poking a whole in Marx's assesment of nationalism, seeing in resurgent colonial nationalism asomething healthy (29), and he ends with a quote by Sun Yat-Sen to the extent that ex-colonies can't consider cosmopolitanism untilthey have deeloped their own strong nationalisms. Yet this is a claim it seems to me still soundly in the Marxist teleology tha tmoves through various forms to the cosmopolitanism o fthe worker.&nbsp; (30)</p>
<p>* In the next section which I won' t take notes on as closely, he goes into some of the attempts to consider the contempoary moment. Based on his previous section he points out that the way to consider the capacity of contempoary ""cosmopolitics"" must come through an interrogation that does not simply seek to expose nationalism as a ""derivative discourse"" of capitalism, or one that condemns cosmopolitnaism as ""uncommitted bourgeois detachmnent."" (31)</p>"
"Vigorous Male and Aspiring Female: Poetry, Personality, and Culture in Edward Sapir and Ruth Benedict","<p>""Hardness"" and Personality  Handler roots his anlaysis of ""hardness"" in relation to personality in the  cutlural criticism of T.J. Lears and Warren Sussman.  He starts from Susmann's notice of the rising importance of the notion of ""personality"", the shift from ""building character"" to the desire to ""develop personality.""  He uses Lears to say that this was the indivdiuals' desire to counter the ""weightlessness"" of modern times.  A desire for the ""real.""  Ezra Pound he uses as an example writing to Harriet Monroe in October 1912: ""I go about this London hunting for the real..."" (quoted on 98).  Handler says for Pound and the imagists hardness was about ""sincere self-expression"".  Pound's dictums were: ""I.Direct treatment of the 'thing' whether subjective or objective,' and '2. To use absolutely no word that does not contribute to the presentation'"" (quoted on 98).  The ""thing"" could either be a feeling or something in the ""objective"" world.  T.E. Hulme also expressed this ideal: ""The great aim is accurate, precise and definite description.  The first thing is to recognise how extraordinarily difficult this is.  It is no mere matter of carefulness; you have to use language, and language is by its very nature a communal thing; that is, it expresses never the exact thing but a compromise--that which is common to you, me and everybody.  But each man sees a little differently, and to get out clearly and exactly what he does see, he must have a terrific struggle with language."" (quoted on 98-99 from ""Spectulations"" (1924)  Croce also in 1902 ""Aesthetics as Science of Expression and General Linguistic saw this as the problem of achiveing what Handler terms ""direct intiution of reality"".  (99)  Handler sums up: ""Hardness, then, in the aesthetics of the new poetry, referred both to technique and to the artist's vision; it suggested that real art depended on the discovery of a personal reality, a reality penetrated, understood, embraced, and expressed by the self, standing alone.""  (99)    Is that so accurate, this then would be an entirely solopsistic selfhood.  That's not what Sapir was driving at e.g. I think.  Certainly not Benedict I don't think.</p>"
Lost Manhood Found: Male Sexual Impotence and Victorian Culture in the United States,"p. 54 - 55   Women Seen as Cause of Sexual Impotence in Men	

Dr. William Robinson wrote in 1912 a book on sexual impotence in which he saw women as heping to increase incidences of sexual impotence in men.  I.e. frigidity in women caused sexual impotence in men.  And they specualted also that frigidity in women was actually also latent homosexuality.  (54) 

Ultimately, women were also seen by 20s, e.g. New Woman and Flapper, as sexually active and expressive, but women were now sexualized and those who were not were stigmatized as ""frigid."" This Mumford observes helped ""to legitimate men's sexual claims on women."" (56)"
Beyond Separate Spheres: Intellectual Roots of Modern Feminism,"<p>p.156-162 Parsons work on Family  Her book The Family (1906) was result of course that Giddings allowed her to teach on Family Organization.  (156).  She arranged her ethnoloical sources in an ""evolutionary sequence"" lke most writers on the subject at the time.  (156) .  It led from primitive savagery through matriachry and patriarchy to the monogamous family., what she called the ""modenr simple family."" (156)   She noted many anthropologists belief that the matriachy predated the patriarchy in this sequence, but also cast doubt on the conflusions of male ethnologists (156) .  She accepted the view that the modern family was the most advanced. (157) : prolonged childhood, lengthy education, freedom from migration weakened kinship ties, more freedom for indivdiual development and selfrealization.  (157)  But she thought hte modern family still maintianed patriarchal vestiges.  She believed women were bound in a number of ways by patriachal strictures: poor education, inability to education their children.  (157-8).    Most of the text was dry and removed, but for last 8 pages which caused a scandal and caused her newly elected husband's opponents to criticis the book as ""barbarous"" and a ""debasement of marriage."" (158)  Parsons basically did not think that education of women was enough.  she attacked what Veblen had noted as the producer husband and the consumer wife.  She thought women needed to produce.  (158-160).    She also translated Gabriel Trade's The Laws of Imigation while working on the Family.  She applied his theory of a notion of tricke-down influence of progress from elites to lower classes, to women.  E.g. she had written in ""Higheer Education of Womena nd the Family""  that tenemant house-wives or farmer's wives were more ""primitive"" in that they are ""even more subject to marital mastery than their leisure-class sisters."" (quoted o 160)&gt;  SAnd then ""As, Gabriel  Tarde has pointed out to us, it is only people at the top of the scale who have enough social prestige to negotiate radical changes."":(quoted on 160)&gt;    She also attacked Victorian condemnation of sexuality.  Thinking that it also weakened women's development of personality.  (160).  Most radical ideas was that to ""trial marriage"" (161).     New York Times condemdned the book for its subversive tendencies also (162).</p>"
Of Feys and Culture Planners: Margaret Mead and Purposive Activity as Value,"<p>p. 104 - 6 Stability of ""temperament""  Sullivan describes Mead's approach to culture and personality, heavily influenced by an awareness of the biological ground of personality in temperament, an idea which she drew from William McDougall (who had drawn on Jung's Psychological Types).    Sullivan gives a description here, like the one he gave in his other article.  See Related link on this note.  But here heputs it more clearly and succinctly.  And he draws out the following important point which is helpful to me in terms of my project of describing these nathropologists attempts to re-construct selfhood: ""While Mead noted Euroepan attmepts to maintain such 'culturally achieved balances' under the rubrics of race and caste, the important conclusion of this reasoning was that a given temperamental type could become a general characteristic of a population and influence the ethos of its society."" (104-105)  He notes that different temperaments had different strengths, and he quotes her as characterizing male/female temperaments thisway: ""Because the balances achieved differed, the temperaments,with their respective strengths and weaknesses, differed as well.  'Fluidity of habit,' Mead wrote, 'is the refuge and strength of F[emale] types,' while 'fixed haibts and a persistent and obstinate activity' were 'the refuge and strength of M[ale] types.""(105)  Again he deals with this notion of stability of these types that Mead had elaborated on 106, especially the bottom paragraph.  The idea was that stability could be achieved through a ""'repeated preocess of hybridizaiton and isolation' wherein temperament and character attain an ongoing pragmatic cultural unity."" (106)  Behavior would vary depending on which type had been made dominant.  At the end this produced a ""variable structural set [of]...contrasting and dialectically related types..."" which Sullivan says satisfied Mead's search for ""systematic variation by comparing and contrasting the various implications for what she called 'the individual's relationship to culture.'"" (106)    Sullivan finally describes that he thinks this approach to the ""person"" was one in which the person is ""not so much a collective representation as he or she is the product of a pragmatic encounter that gives shape to both the person and the culture involved."" (106)  He goes on to describe how this entailed the body being ""shaped by ongoing cultural processes"" (106) such as the ""selection of preferred body type and temperament"" and its being acted on by culture, e.g. during child rearing.  Sullivan says then that the person ""experiences a locally specific process of embodiment."" (106)    Sullivan's description here as can be esen in f.n. 12 is building into this definition ideas from other people, he cites Mauss's essay on the persona and the self, Geertz's essay on the person in Bali from Interpretaiton of Cultures, and Csordas, ed. book on ""Embodiment and Experience"" .</p>"
The Clash of Civilizations?,"p.025-28   Reason for civilizational clash

1) Important argument: he belives the clash will happen b/c ""civilizations are not only real; they are basic."" (25) In other words, b/c 1) these ideas are built into daily life in terms of attitudes toward ""relatoins between God and man, the individual and the group, the citizen and the state, parents and children, husband and wife, as well as differing views of the relative importance of rights and responsiblities, liberty and authority, equality and hierarchy."" (25)  2) b/c such ideas are ingrained due to the fact that ""These differences are the product of centuries."" (25)  They are he says ""far more fundamental than differences among political ideologies and political regimes."" (25)

2) b/c of increased interaction between poeple in the world which intensifies ""civilization consciousness and awareness of differences between civilizations and commonalities within civilizations."" (25)

3) Economic modernization and social change is stripping people of local identieties he says.  Religion is filing a gap he says and religions is a braoder category. (26)

4) Peak of the power of West causing return to ""roots"" in the East, i.e. the ""Asianization' in Japan, the end of the Nehru legacy and the 'Hinduization' of India, the failure of Western ideas of socialism and nationalism and hence 're-Islamization' of the Middle East, and now a debate over Westernization verus Russianization in Boris Yeltsin's country."" (26)

5) Again culture: such difference he says are ""less easily compromised and resolve than economic ones..."" (27)

6) Ecnomic regionalism, intraregional trade is on the increase 51 to 59 % in Europe btw 1980 and 89; 33 to 37% in East Asia; 32 to 36% in N. America."
"The Unspeakable: Discourse, Dialog, and Rhetoric in the Postmodern World","Stephen Tyler on Culture

 Now here is another key moment (that raises Habermas' notion of communicative action).  Tyler writes: 
             ""The communicative context includes, makes possible, and is itself the result of agreements that allow
             disjunction for some purposes in some contexts, while prohibiting disjunciton of the whole field of 
             signifer/signified at once.""  Ironcially, Tyler says that this seems to affirm Saussure's statement 
             that the ""signified and the signifier are held together by the 'social fact of language' (1966:113)..."" (17)
             So ""arbitrariness"" he says also has its countepart in the ""given...conventions understood as if they were both
             natural and the product of intentions mediated by conversation and discourse."" (17-18)  Arbitrariness then
             he thinks is not the ""imposition of culture on nature, nor a reflection of nature within culture; it is 
             the naturalness of the cultural, which is neither a closed system of self-reflecting signs nor of signs
             reflecting a foundational nature."" (18)  He puts this in other words by saying that arbitrariness requires
             conventions, and is in fact ""made by the intersection of person, will, and representation..."" (18)  Person,
             will and representation, on the other hand, can be understood by othe rnames: ""culture, society, and individual,
             repsectively.  The category 'person' is the speaker/hearer, the symbol of culture.  The category 'will' is
             convention/intention, the index of society.  The category 'representation' is signfier/signified, the icon
             of the individual."" (18)  Here he references a 1978 book by himself, <i>The Said and the Unsaid</i>. (18)"
"With science as his shield: Teaching race and culture in American public schools, 1900--1954","00 Abstract 00 
This dissertation is a history of the social construction of race in American schools in the early 20 th century. As racializing national institutions, public schools taught specific definitions of the race concept and they also inscribed certain racial knowledge and behavior as symbolic markers of the educated American citizen. This analysis begins with a reform effort led by anthropologist Franz Boas in the late 1930s. Facing the threat of Nazi Germany, Boas launched an initiative to reform how American schools defined race. Boas argued schools used scientifically inaccurate, racialist, and dangerous conceptions of race in everyday pedagogical practice. Boas concluded schools fueled racial prejudice in America and made the nation vulnerable to the influence of Nazi propaganda. Drawing on dominant anthropological models of racial difference, activist social scientists taught that individuals of any background were potentially equal. Importantly, anthropologists insisted that the dynamic concept of culture was a far more useful concept for explaining human diversity than the biological concept of race. The Boasian concept of culture lost traction as it was translated by educators for use in American schools in the 1940s. Poorly trained in social science theory and struggling to mediate volatile race relations in their classrooms, teachers softened the Boasian critique of racism into ""palatable"" lessons. In most cases teachers simply grafted the language of racial egalitarianism and cultural relativism onto existing models of racial hierarchy. By the end of the war educators consolidated a previously disparate group of white racial minorities into a singular and cohesive ""white"" race, while interpreting Americans of African and Asian descent as not only biologically or racially different, but as culturally separate as well. Racial discourse in American schools shifted again in the postwar era, as teachers adapted tolerance education to conform to new psychological models of racial prejudice. The result was that teachers deliberately silenced the discussion of race in the classroom insisting that all students exhibit ""good manners"" when speaking to or about racial others. This universalizing psychological approach is shown to define the history of later 20 th century efforts to confront racism in American schools."
"From Experts to Social Scientists: The American Anthropologists, 1929-1963","p.046-   Ralph Linton, Abram Kardiner & New Culture & Personality theory

Between 1937 and 1939 a new group came together (at colubmia?) involing Ralph Linton and Abram Kardiner that put forward a new notion of culture and personality.  Kardiner was a psychologist that had been trained in Boasian anthropology.  He taught a course at the New York Psychoanalytic Institute throughout the 1930s on relatoins between culture and personality. 

 He had coordinated with Cora Du Bois in 1936 (she had worked  with Kroeber and Lowie at Berkeley) and they had presented  a critique of Freudian ideas about psychology.  But in 1917 Du Boid left and Linton, Sapir and Kluckhohn were on the scene.  In this context a new personality and culture theory emerged that gave a specail role to the idea of the Freudian ego as ""an adaptive structure mediating between culture and individual desire."" (46).  

This came out in Kardiner's 1939 <>The Individual and His Society</i> that put the indiviudal at the center. 

Madden finds that this focus ont he individual as a ""meeting ground"" for the ideas of different professions in Mead's Competition and Cooperation also.  (46-47)

Linton, who had once been more Boasian, also followed Kardiner.  Madden argues that Linton argued that ""cultures contained 'basic personality structures' that represented the 'constellation of personality characteristics which would appear to be congenial with the total range of institutions comprised within a given culture.'"" (47)  Madden compares this to Benedcit's notiion of patterns, but notes that Linton thought multiple ""personality structures co-existed within a single culture."" (47)  Madden also compares this idea to Sapir's notion that each individual represnted at least one subculture, which he had quoted earlier on p.27.  

Linton felt that this new personality and culture theory made the ""old"" one obsolte.  [Note: what was the ""old"" one?] (47-48).  

Kroeber Madden noted felt that this new theory ""fell outsidethe obdns of anthropology"" (Madden's words, 48).  For K quote see 48-49.  

  Madden roots Kroeber's objection in terms of a commitment to what Madden has called ""expertise"" which is to say a focus on knowledge in the four-fields, rather than theory.  I think he gets Kroeber a bit wrong here.  Kroeber was not opposed to theory , but wanted theoretical understanding of cultural history.., one yes that was empirical... but not opposed to theory as such as long as it was grounded in empirical analysis."

Stocking writes: ""Boas ultiamte success depended on his connections with certain important subcultural mileux in New York and Boston. ""  Boas uncle Abraham Jacobi, prominent in the New York German-Jewish community, had married a daughter of the publisher George Putnam.  While at Clark, Boas formed a freindship with ""one of hte New England Putnams, Professor Frederick Ward Putnam of Harvard's Peabody Museum, who was at this point perhaps the most influential American anthropologist outside Washington, and who, significantly, had always remained somewhat skeptical of the assumptions of cultural evolutionism.""  In the 1890s, Boas followed Putnam from the Chicago Fair to the American Musem of Natural History.  Though Stocking says Putnam maintaind his position at Harvard.  Big break came in 1896: ""The turning point, of course, was the appointment Boas received early in 1896 through the combined efforts of Jacobi and Putnam as lecturer in physical anthropology at Columbia University.  Together with the position he had just accepted at the American Museum as assistant to Putnam, the Columbia appointment provided Boas with a firm institutional base.""  (284)  most significantly, Stocking notes, the tie to the University gave Boas an advantage over the Washingotn crowd who lacked such ties.  (284-285)

Boas relationship with Putnam begins to be attenuated when California dept. is founded under Putnam's direction.  Phoebe Apperson Hearts helped establish the California dept.  (284)

1905 He resigns from AMNH after ocnflict w/ Herman Bumbus, the new director.  (285)  

After Resignation from museum he directs efforts to the ""southern portion sof the New World."" 

He is head of AAA at this point and though his attempt to ""limits its membershi pto professionals had been defeated by the Washington anthropologists,"" his influence had brown by 1907.  

1909 Distpue w/ Charles Walcott, secretar of the Smithsonian.   Boas not offered position as chief of BAE.  Stocking thinks he wouldn't hav taken in but he was mad..  Then Boas finds out that there was an accusation that money transfered to him under McGee's administratin were not clean somehow.    (285-286)

1910 This ""southern strategy"" ""achieved partial fulfillment with the formaiton, in cooperation with German scholars, of the Inernational School of American Archaeology and Ethnology in Mexico City, see Boas, ""The International School of American Archaeology and Ethnology in Mexico"" Sciences 21: 188-183.

1911-1912 He spends academic year as director of Mexico school.  

But the war cuts the life of school short; focus returns to North America."

<p>* The concept of interpretation, which is currently gruonded in a self-conscious attention to ""heremeutics"", is grounded in an ideology of aesthetics that he characterizes as an ""apparatus of power in the field of culture"" that ""determined the political meaning and function of 'culture'"" and which, although it appears to be about art, is really ""a whole program of social, psychical, and political reconstruction on the part of the early European bourgeoisie...""

Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers,"<p>Notes 11/2011</p>
<p>Summary Notes:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appiah's def'n of cosmpolitanism seems to be of the same ilk as that layed out by Seyla Benhabib at least in that it is rooted in a sense of the importance of the dialogical tension between univeral principles and local beliefs and the need to enter into conversations between those two levels.&nbsp; He is perhaps less sure about the emergence of a consensus about universal ""human principles"" as Benhabib, but he is no antifoundaitonalist.&nbsp; He also seems to have some taint of the kind of cosmpolitanism that Waldron espouses and which is rooted in a belief in the variability of human identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Liss has a good review of Apiah's book, which is sharply critical.&nbsp; She first of all links Appiah's ""partical cosmpolitanism"" -- a phrase of his on xvii -- to Boas, Bourne, and W.E.B. Du Bois, citing Bourne's essays on Transnational America and her essay on Boas and Du Bois, and then she also points out that Appiah belongs to a more recent generation of scholars in this lineage who have ""formulated varieties of cosmpolitanism, including 'rooted cosmpolitanism' and 'cosmopolitics.'' (Liss, Review in Rethinking History, v.13, no.3 2009, 420.)&nbsp; The overall point of her critique seems to be that she likes his emphasis on cosmpolitanism as rooted in the challenge that universal principle poses to local identities and vice versa, but that he conceives of the tension between these two poles as too easily bridgeable.&nbsp; She thinks he too easily dismisses anthropologists as non-cosmpolitan because they are suspicious of universal principle -- a stereotype she thinks -- and she suspects that Apiah is guilty of using anti-relativism as a kind of scare tactic in the way that Geertz identifies in his ""Anti-anti-relativism.""&nbsp; (Liss, 421)&nbsp; When Appiah dsicusses the kinds of obligations that we have to strangers, which is a major part of his argument, she thinks he does not focus explicitly enough on the major kinds of predicaments we face:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would have liked Appiah to address more<br />explicitly the kinds of predicaments we face. For instance, how do people address traumatic histories and the very contentious political and cultural legacies that develop from them?8 In more immediate problems, such as starving children, war, or genocide, the real difficulty, as he acknowledges, is<br />not the danger that we do too much but that we don’t do anything. Samantha Power addresses inaction in A problem from hell: America and the age of genocide (2002). More recently, she has written on the dangers that the war in Iraq poses for the moral authority of the USA and the possibility of future interventions in international crises. Strikingly, these troubles seem to pose more serious challenges than those Appiah addresses. (422)&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Introduction:</p>
<p>* He starts out talking about how the world is coming closer together, ie ""getting smaller"".&nbsp; This has to do with interlocking systems of production and also things like the interweb.&nbsp; So the he asks what ste of ideas can be used to deal with it.&nbsp; He dismisses globalization and multiculturailsm and then comes to cosmopolitanism. He, like Brian Milstein, tracaes it to the Cynic.&nbsp; He puts at its center, like so many people, the same tension between universal and particular.&nbsp; In his case it is put in terms of ethics:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So there are two strands that intertwine in the notion of cosmopolitanism.&nbsp; One is the idea that we have obligations to others, obligations that stretch beyond those to whom we are related by the ties of kith and kind, or even the more formal ties of a shared citizenship.&nbsp; The other is that we take seriously the value&nbsp; not just of human life but of particualr human lives, which means taking an interest in the pratices and beliefs that lend them significance. (xv)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like Hollinger in his <em>Cosmpolitanism &amp; Solidarity, </em>cosmpolitnaism is also not like universalism in that it sees that there is something to belearned from difference.&nbsp; (xv)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* He also notes that the cosmopolitanism has a negative side.&nbsp; The cosmpolitan can be someone who forsakes his kin for the abstraction of humanity.&nbsp; Ie here he is chanelling Burke's critique of Rousseau as ""A lover of his kind, but a hater of his kindred."" becuase R gave u p his kids to an orphanage.&nbsp; (xvi) He notes that the haters of cosmpolitans eg Hitler and Stalin he is glad to oppose (xvi-xvii)</p>
<p>* He likes a passsage in George Eliot's <em>Daniel Deronda</em> from 1876.&nbsp; Deronda was raised in England as a Christian but disovers his Jewish ancestry as an adult.&nbsp; He commits himselof to the ""furtherance of his 'hereditary people'"" but without rejecting his human identity.&nbsp; He sees the Jewishness as an ""added soul"".&nbsp; He wished he had been brought up Jewish but he also would have wanted a broad perspective.&nbsp; And he said elsewhere in the novel ""I want to be an Englishman, but I want to understand other points of view.&nbsp; And I want to get rid of a merely Engliish attitude in studies."" (xviii)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* I think this initial discussion is revealing of his point of veiw, but also ultimately at the end he makes some other revealing statements about his point of view.&nbsp; He thinks that the ""foreigness of foreigners, the strangers of strangers"" is a real enough phenomenon--he has just been talking about the post september 11th context--but that ""we've been encouraged, not least by well-meaning intellectuals, to exaggrate their significance by an order of magnitude."" (xxi)&nbsp; He think that it is IS an error to not talk about ""objective"" values, but that local values are also necessary.&nbsp; This seems similar to what Seyla Benhabib is saying, and he like Benhabib also uses the ""model"" of ""conversation"": ""The world is getting more crowded: in the next half a century the population of our once foraging species will approach nine billion.&nbsp; Depending on the circumstances, conversations across boundaries can be delightful, or just vexing: wha tthe mainly are, though, is inevitable."" (xxi)&nbsp; This resembles the point Hollinger said so many of the new writers on cosmpolitanism are saying, that if you don't go to meet the world, it will come to you anyway.</p>
<p>Ch. 1</p>
<p>*&nbsp; This chapter uses Richard Burton to get at the notion of the world and meaning in terms of&nbsp; shattered mirror, each piece being one part of the larger truth, but giving an oblique view of the whole.&nbsp; So that from Burton, who was a racist, you get the idea that you can find a bit of the truth everywhere and the whole truth nowhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>* He then notes that this doesn't really help with the bigger problem that there are irresolvable conflicts that emerge between differnet points of view.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ch. 2 Escape from Positivism</p>
<p>* He starts out by going through the notion of cultural relativism presented by cultural anthropologists, but then in the section ""Exile of Value"" he wants to argue that modern ""profesisonal relativism"" wasn't simply an outgrowth of classical skepticism but instead emerged out of Positivism.&nbsp; He gives an analysis here that is compelling but reductive. He doesn't mention many positivist thinkers, mainly Hume.&nbsp; No Comte I don't think.&nbsp; So I was a bit ocnfused by what exactly his positivism is...17-25.</p>
<p>* Then in the section ""Values Reclaimed"" he pushes back, saying that he thinks positivism had it wrong.&nbsp; Becuase they misunderstood values.&nbsp; In his account of positivism, values are simply a reflection of human desires...the values or beliefs are the way to satisfy the desires.&nbsp; (This sounded more like utitliariansim and associational pyschology to me, hence HUme ?) .&nbsp; He wants to reverse things.&nbsp; Desires are responses to values he thinks. ""Values guide our acts, our thoughts, and our feelings.&nbsp; These are our <em>responses</em> to values."" (25)&nbsp; Ultimately this takes him to the idea of stories, where he sees these values as being elaborated and, more i mportantly, discussed, where the language of values is negotiated and coordinated.&nbsp; (Does this hold for myth for him?) He brings up the film Osama from 2004 that deals withthe Taliban as an example of where he thinks ther eis a discussion going on about values.&nbsp;&nbsp; This gets him to the piont that I think is most robust here and fits with his notion of converation.&nbsp; The convesration happens within stories for him it seems and it is this conversation that can get us to the universal truth:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Folktales, drama, opera, novels, short stories; biographies, histories, ethnographies; fiction or nonfiction; painting, music, sculpture, and dance: every human civilization has ways to reval to us values we had not preivously recognized or undermine our commitment to values that we had settled into.&nbsp; Armed with these terms, fortified with a shared language of value, we can often guide one another, in the cosmpolitan spirit, to shared responses; and when we cannot agree, the understanding that our responses are shaped by some of the same vocabulary can make it easier to agree to disagree.&nbsp; (30)</p>

Franz Boas and the Humboldtian Tradition: From Volkgeist and Nationalcharakter to an Anthropological Concept of Culture,"<p>[Summary Note] Bunzl's article provides in its bulk a pretty thorough basic summary of the Germano-Romantic tradition of thought (as I call it) from the time of HErder, Kant, and the Humboldt brothers into the late 19th century anthropologists like Theodore Waitz and Adolf Bastian. It is useful. Bunzl essentially accepts the account of this tradition laid out by Isaiah Berlin as he refers to these ideas using the title of Berlin's famous essay: ""The Counter-Enlightenment."" (20) But Bunzl also at the same time emphasizes that this tradition was committed to a version of cosmpolitnaism. (20-21) And at one point he asserts that ""Waitz reasserted the unique combination of universalism aqnd particularism exemplified in the anthropology of Herder and Wilhelm von Humboldt; like them, he saw the separation of humanity into distinct peoples as an affirmation of commun humanity."" (46) The remainder of the essay is dedicated to demonstrating the connection between Boas' ideas and htis tradition. He does this quite effectively in the section ""Boasian anthropology: From Museum Debates to the Cosmographical Critique of the Comparative Method."" (52-63) His main assertion comes on 61 when after discussing Boas' ""Limiations of the Comparative Method of Anthropoloogy"" (paper given in 1896 at the AAAS critiquing the evolutionists) he quotes Boas at length and then says: ""Boas here tied together the theoretical currents of historicist Counter-Enlightenment thinking: first, the skepticism of finding natural laws governing human behavior; second, the rejection of psychic unity of humanity, operating according to rational principles regardless of space and time; third, the focus on the individuality and diversity of phenomena as opposed to their similarity and unvierality; finally, the emphasis on actua hsitorical development in place of ocnjectures and speculatoin, on induction as opposed to deduction."" (61) One particularly valuable thing I realized while reading this article (which Bunzl notes but does not draw out) is that the fact tat Boas did not in fact completely reject the evolutionists desire to ascertain laws is significant also in terms of the fact that in Boas' very early ""The Study of Geography"" (1887) in which Boas describes Naturwissenschaften and Geisteswissenschaften as two ""desires of the mind"" (affective and aeshetic) that this is significant in that it what Boas has effectively attempted to do here is bridge these two traditions by arguing that they are fundamental modes of inquiry to all human minds. I don't htink anybody has really noted that about this text, but it is significant in that it demonstrates Boas' desire to mediate between these two traditions... It is also interesting perhaps that he does this in a somewhat psychological manner, describing these modes of inquiries ase ""desires""... Bunzl's article is good...the only thing that I migth criticize it on is its desire to see Boas' turn toward culture as entirely linked to and emerging out of this ""Humbuoldtian tradition"" (as he calls it) of thought. One of the things my War Chatper will do for instance is point out that culture emerged not so much out of his commitment or engagement with this tradition but his need to come up with a rhetorical response to the war...and to what he perceived as the destruction of the intellectual project which is best captured not by a strong commitment to the Humbolditan tradtion but rather to the ability to bridge that tradition and the more positivistic Anglo-French that one can see in ""The Study of Geogrpahy.""</p>"
"From Experts to Social Scientists: The American Anthropologists, 1929-1963","p.015 Characterization of pre-1920 Professional Structure of Anth

""Though Boas and many of his early students conducted much of their research in universities, prior to 1920, only about half of the anthropologists in the United States worked in universities.  Many anthropologists worked in museums.  Often local private philanthropists funded museums, and much of the funding for anthropological research came from small, local organizations or individuals.  Early in the twentieth century, departments of anthropology at universities in America were closely connected with local museums, and anthropologists working in academic institutions received funding from individual philanthropists also.  Boas and the students in the departrment of anthropology at Columbia in which he worked received substantial financial support for research from one women[sic], Elsie Clews Parsons.  In 1906, Alfred Louis Kroeber, Boas' student, established an anthropology department at the University of California at Berkeley with funds from another woman philanthropolist, Phoebe Hearst.""

The Subject of Liberty: Toward a Feminist Theory of Freedom,"p.006-10  Positive Lib. Analysis

Positive liberty.  She says it ""expands"" on neg lib.  It focuses on the ""'positive' provisions of the conditions necessary to take advantage of negative liberties..."" (7)

Pays attention to context--in fact, though some neg. lib. theorists have worked this init. def.  into neg.  lib.e..g seeing poverty as an 'external barrier'...(7)

But what neg. lib cannot think of is idea of 'internal barriers' i.e. immediate desires whcih interfere w/ more noble, higher, or 'second order desires' (7) which represent the ""true self"" of the indivi. 

So Berlin an dother neg. lib. theorists play down, in other words, the idea that the self can be divided against itself that it can have conflicting desires. (8)

She give an example.  She wants to quit smoking but she gets in a fight with her department chair which provokes her to give into her desire to smoke, a desire which most would agree makes her less free...

So in the case that she gives into the lower order desire to smoke she is no longer free, she is not ""exercising"" her freedom.  Not pursuing her true self in its desire to quit smoking.  ""For this reason, Taylor calls positive liberty an 'exercise concept' of freedom: people must exercise their full capacities if they are to be considered free."" (8)

But this idea that one's own desires can be conflicted leads to the other idea that somebody else might at a certain moment whne you are giving into lower order deires, know what is better for you, and traditionally that ""someone"" is the state...i.e. positive lib can justify totalitarianism or male patriarchal attitudes toward women. (8)

Taylor proposes a solution to this, that avoids the ""totalitarian menace"" -- i.e. he think that each individual can be consicous of higher an dlower order desires in himself and know how to work toward those higher order deires. (9-10)  He gives example of not wanting to yell at woman with whom he has an important relationship...

But Hirschman (9-10) thinks that Taylor oversimplifies pos. liberty in manner of neg. liberty: avoiding the way context constructs higher and lower order desires.  Taylor she says treats these desires as emerging spontaneously from himself, from the ""highly individuated subject."" (9)"

Moralized intelligence for instance ""survived the definitive quantification of intelligence  albeit not for very long..."" (211-212) E.g. Catherin Cox's 1926 attempt to estimate IQs of Copernicus Voltaire, Goethe, and JS Mill ""which included a character rating of, <em>inter alia</em>, their 'degree of sense of humor,' 'trustworthiness' family affection,' 'pure-mindedness,' and 'neatness'."" (212).  Daston asays that Cox's ideas were last gasp of ""an ancient tradition of moralizing the intellect.  Whereas mid-twentieth-century psychologists  in principle divorced personality and character, in the nineteenth-century there was no attempt to make that distinction.    ""for examle Darwin identified genius with 'unflinching, undaunted perseverence'; Galton claimed that 'natural ability' was compounded of capacity, zeal and ' an adequate power of doing a great deal of laborious work'"" (212).    Important categories:   Sensitivity:  (sensibilite' / sinnlichkeit).  It referred to ""both perceptual and emotional sensitivity to impressions.  Thus sensibility was at once the precondition for empirical knowledge and for the reasonable emotoins of charity and compassion, which bound society together."" (212)   Reason: ""more closely identified with morality, for it was through the 'natural light' of reason that, according to jurists, humans came to recognize all forms of truth, including 'the eternal distinction between good and evil, the inviolable rule of justice [that] receives without difficulty the approbation of every man who refelects and who reasons.'"" (212)  Qutoe by D'alambert and Diderot.</p>
<p>But most importantly folink r the ideas about women: reason also required certain moral values (that is, as well as generating them).  IT required patience nad concentration and, DAston writes, ""[m]ore than one early modern author disqualified women from philosophical contemplation on the ground that they lacked the self-discipline and stamina to follow long demonstrations and intricate arguments: 'It is true that women ordinarily have less application, less patience for reasoning insequence, less courage and resolution than men.'""  (212)</p>
<p>The ""interdependence between moral and intellectual traits opened a channel through which social norms and cultural Values could flow..."" (212) [Note: the doctrine of inherited consequences did the same thing in the nineteenth century...]</p>

Belief in what she calls ""sexual democracy"" -- desire to escape from ""female-dominated home, male-dominated world."" (226) Belief that ""the ""generative powers of communication"" in modernity (what is that??) would put an end to the ""battle of the sexes"" and would lead to ""transcendent friendships unimaginable to earlier generations"", the 'true companionship and oneness' of men and women that Emma Goldman preached in her lectures on love.""

The Dainty and the Hungry Man: Literature and Anthropology in the Work of Edward Sapir,"<p>p.052-58   Early Development of Sapir's theory</p>
<p>Last Boasian work: ""Time Perspective in Aboriginal American Cutlure,"" published in 1916.  That year Handler thinks was a turning point.  That same year he publishes a paper on Australian composer Percy Grainger and on Americaan culture in response to John Dewey.  In 1917, more writings outside the realm of anthropology: ""two reviews of psychoanalytic works, reviews of a series of novels and of a musician's biography, and two essay on literary thoery, all published in the <em>Dial</em>."" (53)  Between 1918 and 1921, H notes, that Sapir's writing of such works more or less equaled his anthropological works.  He was publishing in the <em>Dial, Freeman, New Republic, </em>and <em>Nation</em>.  In 1922 his writing of this sort outnumbered his anthropological works.  After that his writing of suchworks dwindled and then his last literary review appearedin 1928.  His poetry publicationfollows a similar pattern.</p>
<p>What he was rethinking here was Boas' paradigm.  He had initially enacted a stricly Boas' model at Ottawa.  (53) HIs major theoretical contribution was the ""Time Perspectives"" piece in 1916, for descp see 54.  Handler sees it as ""uncharacteristic."" (54)</p>
<p>Expression of dissatisfaction with Boas' paradigm begins in 1916 letters to Lowie.  He cites 1980 by Richard Preston that Sapir was stimulated by friendship with Radin who in a long letter of 1915 had ""castigated Boas for his methodologicaltimidity and lack of historical imagination."" (54) Radin thought ""Boas was far too concerned iwth reconstruction chronological accounts of the development of primitive culture and with 'certain general factors, like dissemination, convergent evolution, independent origin, etc.'"" (Handler's words with Radin quote, 54)</p>
<p>Sapir seemed to echo Radin in his 1916 letters to Lowie.  (55)</p>
<p>Handler quotes at length Sapir explaining why he engages in music and his dissatisfaction wththe profession.  Hander's analysis on 56-57.  He captures the dualities, tradeoffs, and binaries that Sapir lays out and connects it to Boas' aesthetic v. affective division in humn sceince.  He brings up that around 1920 anthropology was being taught by Goldenweiser who was beocming interested in ""wholes"" and on the other hand Parsons who taugh it as an ""enourmous mass of little bits of material, carefully labeled by time, palce and tribe..."" (Mead's words I think from Mead, 1959 book Anthropologist at work, p8)...Handler ssums it up: ""there was the duty to study culture elements and a desire to discover culture wholes--an inuman science in place and a human sicence on the horizon."" (58)--by saying ""inhuman"" Handler is referring back to Sapir's description of the discipline as ""unhuman"".</p>
<p>[Note: I think Handler misses the bureaucratic component here.  This is about dissatisfaction with anthropology as a professional science.  How else could Sapir refer to Anthropology as ""unhuman""!--a science that studies human in the broadest sense?]</p>

The Subject of Liberty: Toward a Feminist Theory of Freedom,000 Introduction 000
The Problem of the Convergence of Industrial Societies: A Critical Look at the State of Theory,"[Summary Card]
Weinberg's article gives a very (very!) brief history of two centuries of convergence theory, and then attempts to examine contemporary (1969) modernization theory to discovery the ideas about convergence that persist therein.  Weinberg states on p.4 that he will make an attemp to ""salvage"" the concept as ""worthy of more attention.""  What he finds is that although contemporary modernization theory often denies convergence, its theories often resemble the assumptions of 18th and 19th century convergence theory.  Weinberg details this on pgs. 9-13.  In the end, he suggests that convergence theory might be salvaged if it were put on a more empirical basis.  The problem with modernization theory as with older convergence theory is that the deductive method produces abstractions which seem arbitary and assume that convergence ends with the state of modern industrial society in the west as it exists at the itme of the writer.  Weinberg writes: ""Too littl ethus explains too much."" (12)
This article is useful not only because of its critique of modernization theory a la Parsons, etc, but also because it provides some very very brief but useful summaries of the basic tenets of modernization theory, and also includes extensive citations of that theory.  Besides all that,  Weinberg's idea that the hypothesis that a process of convergence is occurring in history might survive an exposure to extensive empirical data is somewhat useful, especially if we free ourselves of the idea that our the contemporary state of society is the end-point of convergence, is a point well-taken.  This insight may also make"
Autonomy in Moral and Political Philosophy (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy),"<p>Section 3.2 - Identity and Conceptions of the Self</p>
<p>Autonomy as described in the article attaches to individuals, not groups.  So critics claim that autonomy is problematic becuase it ignores that ""we are all not only deeply enmeshed i nsocial relations and cultural patterns, we are also defined by such relations."" (See Sandel 1982, 15-65)  Language is a particulaar important example, since it is a social product.... ""In any nmber o way we are constitued by factors that lie beyond our reflective control but which nonetheless structure outr values, thoughts, and motivations."" (She cite Taylor's <em>The Ethics of Idenitty</em> and also Bell here).</p>
<p>This also brings up the quesiton of the ""relation of the self to its culture.""  This becomes important in discussions of cultural rights and naitonslism, because such a def'n of autonomy ""exludes those indivdiudals and gorups whose self-identity and value commitments are deeply constituted by cultural factors from the protection of liberal princpiles and policies."" And also it ""forestalls moves to rpove state protection for cultural forms themselves...""</p>

The Invention of Leisure in Early Modern Europe,"00 Summary Note 00

Burke is revisiting a focus of research that had begun in the 60s about leisure.  He starts out the essay reviewing the arguments and the main propositions that began with the initial set of studies, and then he proposes some points in support of the thesis that ""leisure activities of different kinds, whether for children or adults, males or females, came to be viewed as less and less marginal from the late Middle Ages onwards."" (144)

In tracing the general argment, Burke emphasizes the idea that the recent work has been based on the idea ""of a fundamental discontinuity or great divide between pre-industrial and industrial society....[that] in medieval and early modern Europe, as in other pre-industrial societies, the modern idea of leisure was lacking.  The modern distinction between theideas of work and leisure, like the regular alternation of work an dleisure, was a product of industrial capitliasm.  Pre-industrial societies had festivals (together with informal and irregular breaks from work), while industrial societies have leisure, weekends, and vacations.  The emergece of leisure is therefore part of the process of modernization."" (137, here he cites M.R. Marrus, The Emergence of Leisure, 1974).  

He admits then that it is hard to defend the idea of a continuous history of leisure without ""rupture,"" but as indicated in the ittle, he thinks that leisure began to be defined in this other way in the ealry modern period. 

Between 138-142, he does an etymologyical analysis in several languages, esp. french, latin, italian, and english.  He finds that the word leisure was not so much in use as was the word pastimes... 

Then though he notes a debate in which the likes of Ben Jonson, Milton and Marvell in the England defended ""traditional holidays and pastimes, which were under threat for a mixture of religious and economic reasons."" (143)  Some reformers though of pasttimes and wasted time or in terms of the sin
of ideleness.  (143) 

He notes then that a medical discourse on <i>ozio onesto</i> also emerged citing the need for ""refreshment"" through sleep, games, music and other recreations. (144) 

That is how he leads up to the rest of the paper wherein he lays out seven points in support of the idea that leisure had begun to be develpoed in the early modern period.  In laying out these points, however, he basically reinforces the basic point that had been develloped before, that is even as this concept of leisure is developing it 1) supports a new sharp division between work and labor, and 2) leisure activities are subject to useful or ""rational"" recreation.  

He does however suggest that the notion of free time may originally have been a locus of ""reaction"" agains the increasingly regulated nature of society in the early  modern period (i.e. the development of the notion of ""discipline"" as Foucoult described It), bu tthat as free time itself became more organized and regulated ""people became more conscious of it as a separate domain, rather than as a pause between boutsof work.  As work became less playful and working hours were more sharply defined, there was more need for the non-utilitarian activities we have come to call 'leisure.'"" (150)  

One feature of Burke's analysis is also to highlight the notion of leisure's initial emergence among elites.  For example, when the academies arose in italian cities in the 16th and 17th centuries, it seems that these instituions wer eseen as promoting a new form of lesiure. That he says is indicated by the ""names of some of these upper class discussion clubs, including the 'idlers' (Oziosi) and the 'unemployed' (Sfaccendati)."" (147)  At the end of his essay, after having pointed out that the regimentation of work, helped produce the increasingly importance of the notion of leisure among all classes, Burke thus writes; ""In that sense, we owe our concept of leisure to the poeple hwo, long before the Industrial Revolution, were obsessed with making others work.""

Imagining Totality: Rhetorics of and Versus Culture,"<p>00 Summary 00  Hegeman evaluates the wisdom of ""jettisoning"" the word culture in this article.   Her biggest argument, which she achieves through a thorough analysis of Walter Benn Michaels critique of the term, is that many of those who would like the term not to be uses, and i particular Michaels, implicitly equate culture with the ""totality"" of what we believe.  Thus by making it something we cannot discuss in their mind they prevent us from imagining the totality.  Thus her defense of the term culture is that it 1) helps us thinking about totality and 2) that in thinking about it we might realize that such  totlaities are provisional. Here' s they key quote:  ""In other words, I am not sure that we are entirely ""beyond"" thinking in terms of totality.  Nor do I consider totalizing knowledges illegitimate as ways of thinking.  Postmodern ""anti-totalizing"" positions usefully teach us not that we are confinied in our knowledges to the local and to the personal, but rather that the totalities we propose are <em>provisional</em>--that total knowledge only exists in the moment before we shift our perspective or take into account the next bit of evidence, the next voice.""    She also points out that Michaels' argues from a particular vantage in the US where nationalism has become a negative project; whereas she point out via an essay by Arif Dirlik, Culturalism as hegemonic Ideology"" and a book by Partha Chatterjee,"" The Naiton and its Fragments: colonail and Postcolonial Histories"" that ""particularly in postcolonial contexts, nationalism has strong anti-imperialist and (like cultural politics) should not be simplistically dismissed as political a political evil."" see f.n. #35.</p>"
The Cultural Return,"<p>On Aesthetics</p>
<p>* Most interestingly, she says that in the academy this return of master narratives has produced a ""renewal of interests in aesthetics, ethics, and even theology."" (4) There's a return she says to ""literary formalism"" and in general a rejection of interdisciplinary muddiness and a demand for disciplinarity clarity.&nbsp; These demands come along with polemics against ""culturalism"" and historicism and ""content analysis."" (3)&nbsp; She notes that ""cultural studies"" is usually labeled as the ""imperialist"" disciplinary villian.&nbsp; And ""[t]othis overreaching, relativistic, anarchic, and hypocritically market-oriented cultural studies is opposed a newly sober, properly disciplined study of the good, the true, and the beautiful."" (5) Hence aesthetics...</p>
<p>(Key here I tihnk is that I think for Hegeman aesthetics is understood as a particular ideology of justification of the liberal-bourgeois order... as in Eagleton's article on the subject...?&nbsp;</p>
<p>* She traces this return to aesthetics on 5-6 /&nbsp; Alexander Alberro sees it as a response to a contemporary moment defined by a series of ""catastrophes"" in the face of which it is somehow unsurprising that there has been a call by writers for a ""pathos-infused, humanist aesthetics."" (5) Alan Badiou sees it as a failure of the left after teh collapse of revolutionary marxism, where the left has adopted the ""principles of the established 'Western' order"" instead of seeking out ""terms of new politics of collective liberation..."" (5)</p>
<p>* The reaction to a sense of crisis that is propelling a return to aesthetics she think si also evident in ""calls for the return to the aesthetic, where beauty is aligned with a realm of pleasure neglected by the modernist (and political) emphasis on the sublime."" (5) She cites Wendy Steiner's <em>Venus in Exile</em>.&nbsp; But also ""more complexly"" she points to an arguemnt by Chris Castiglia and Ross Castronovo about how cultural studies ""debunked"" traditional essentialized identities but did so ""without supplying in their stead grounds for collective life that are affectively satisfying as well as theoretically plausible."" (quoted on 5)&nbsp; Castiglia and Castronovo see the tIntroductionurn to aesthetics as a respond to this ""putative failure"" in that it ""traffics in affective sensations that promise--wtihotu necessarily providing--post-identity or non-normative forms of collectivism."" (quoted on 5)&nbsp; Castiglia and Castronovo Hegeman points out are interested in ""resolving the individualism of aesthetic experience with collectivity: that is, in renegotiating the relationship between aesthetics and politics."" (5-6)&nbsp; She thinks this is pretty typical of the new calls for a consideration of aesthetics, much as she says those (e.g. Nussbaum) calling for a return to ethics are interested in ""bridging the gap between humanist universals and the particularities of identity and subjectivity.""

1929 Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial merges with Rockefeller Foundation; Ruml retires, later to take position at SSRC.  (16) 

Rockefeller foundation was less willing to support social scieinces: ""Before the fondation had merged with the Memorial, medical professionals controlled the activities of the Rockefeller Foundation, and the institution was willing to support social scientific research."" (17)

This fact plus the crash of the stock market meant that there were limited funds available to social science and after 1934 ""Foundation officials abandoned most of their direct support of social scientific institutions."" (17) 

Nonetheless, through the 1930s the SSRC depending ""almost exclusively on Rockefeller money.""

Of Feys and Culture Planners: Margaret Mead and Purposive Activity as Value,"p. 111 - 114  Mead & Progress

Sullivan then analyzes Mead's correspondence mainly with Gorder but also Dollard and concludes convincingly from these sources that Mead perceived ""Progress"" to be a positive notion.  But here Progress was built upon instability or a lack of self-fulfillment that is a product of the culture (i.e. the non-Balinese culture, the non-fey culture, the N[orth] or S[outh] culture) and which then required that a gap be filled...that is the gap could be filled with ""art""... and not just social institutions which created provisions for self-fulfillment... 

The ""culture planner"" also played a role here.  The culture planner helped push unbalanced people into a focused concentration on their work, but that focused concentration on their work was NOT the kind of concentration that the Balinese possessed which Sullivan shows Bateson made clear in a quote quoted on 114.  

This is excellent analysis here.

Laslty on 114, Sullivan notes that when Mead was still enthusiastic about ""Progress"" and that when she returned to the US in the midst of WWI she ""easily eit into wartime work; her concepts of culture, personality, and temperament offered a useful conceptual scheme that scholars might use to frame the research they produced to fulfill the demands of the U.S. government for knowledge of allied and enemy cultures."" (114) -- i.e. knowledge using these kinds of dichotomies between static, equilibrated, fey cultures and unstable, dynamic, and un-equilibrated cultures in which the culture planner played a necessary role."

Editorial in the NY Times on October4 10, 1917 when Beard resigns from Columbia critizes him for criticizing the writers of the consistution as having class-interest, and for being associated with a school they associate with ideas ""borrowed from Germany"" i.e.  ""economic determinsim.""  
""Columbia...is better for Professor Beard's resignation.  Some years ago Professor Beard published a book [Economic Interpretation of the Constitution] in which he sought to show that the founders of this Republic and the authors of its Constitution were a ring of land speculators who bestowed upon the country a body of organic law drawn up chiefly in the interest of their own pockets.  It was pointed out to him at the itme, with due kindness but frankly, that his book was bad, that it was a book no professor should have written, since it was grossly unscientific...It was the fruit of that school of thought and teaching...borrowed from Germany, which denies ot man in his larger actions and capacity of noble striving and self-sacrifice for ideals, that seeks always as the prompting motive either the animal desire to get more to eat or the hope of fillin ghis pockets.  If this sort of teaching were allowed to go unchecked by public sentiment and the strong hands of University Trustees, we should presently find edcuated American youth applying the doctrine of economic determinism to everything from the Lord's Prayer tothe binomial theorem.""

The Dainty and the Hungry Man: Literature and Anthropology in the Work of Edward Sapir,"<p>p.065-</p>
<p>Now Handler connects Sapir's discussion of art more concretely to Sapir's theory of culture.</p>
<p>He starts with Sapri's review of Lowie's <em>Primitive Society</em>.  Sapir appreciates it as the epitome of the Boasian school, which is defined by ""inducvie historical research,, which it opposes to evolutionary speculation and psychological reductionism: 'We learn to see a given primitive society...as a complex of historical processes that is only to be unraveled, and then in insigifant degree, thorugh a minute weighing of the concrete, interacting features of that society and through the patient following out of the numerous threats that inevitably bind it to its geographical neighbors."" (quoted on 65-66)</p>
<p>H also notes what he calls Sapir's sense that the ""historical process is huma rather than superorganic.""  He quotes as evidence: ""No one that has watched the gradual, tortuous emergence of a social instituiton from the warp and woof of circumstance can feel it in his heart to say that he is but beholding the determinate unfolding of....whatever psychological concept be accepted for guidance."" (quoted on 66, from 378 in Sapir's text).  [Note: I notice two things here, one that he invokes the heart/intuition as guidance for the interpreter, and then that he mentions a ""psychological concept"" guiding the emergence of social institutions...what does he mean?]</p>
<p>H next treats Sapir's review of Parsons edited text <em>American Indian Life</em>.  Sapir likes it because it shows the perspective from the those who live it.  Sapir had defined cutlure in the Lowie review as ""the fine art of living"" and praised Lowie fro retaining a ""Humanness of attitude"" (quoted 66).  So Sapir saw the volume as improvement because it did not stop at the surface but explored the ""individual consciousness"". H suggests tthat Sapir had linked his conception of the ethnologist with the ideal he had set out for ""realism in prose iction."" (66)</p>
<p>Then he moves to ""cutlure, Genuine and Spurious,"" which he says was ""almost certainly"" completed by 1918.  He say it ""contains the first rigorous definition of the Boasian conception of culture as the genius of a people, seein in terms of the patterning of values."" (67)  Drawing on Kroeber and Kluckhon's 1952 clasifcation, he notes that this was the first expression of ""what came commoly to be known as 'cutlural integration.'"" (67) He notes Sapir's dismissal of the term as anything but an abstraction and then goes into his cahracterizaiton of a genuine culture (67-69) Genuine culture is consistent and eschews what Boas had called ""secondary rationalizations"" (see pl67 in 1911 Mind of Primitive Man) which for Sapir are ""the dry rot of social habit, devitalized..."" (p.315 in H's version of Genuine Spurious).  And then he identifies the idea that the genuine culture works from ""the individual to ends."" (quoted on 69).  That creativity is ""the ending of form tone's will, not a manufacture of from <em>ex nihilo</em>."" (quoted o 69)</p>
<p>H observes accurately that ""the romantic formulation of the idea of the cutlural harmony or integration would gie way to the epistemological doubts [with which Sapir started the article] express in his argument agains the superorganic.  Sapir came to insist that culural wholes are analytic constructions, not real objects.   When anthropologists pseak of 'a culture,' they refer to a pattern or system that they themselves have constructed in the analysis of their data.  Cutlure in this sense is a modela bstracted from human interaction."" (69)  More on this reaction on 70, that the ""true locus of cultre is in the interactions of specific individuals and, on the subjective side, in the wrld of meaning which each one of htese individuals may unconsicously abstract from himself from his particiaption in thsese interactions."" (from Cutlra Anthropology and Psychiatry, 515) (70)</p>
<p>H's reasonable summary aobut the links between Sapir's art and anthropology is here: ""In both, Sapir's first goal is to understand subjective realities and experiential tuth as individuals know them.  In both, he concludes that an excessive concern with out realism--ont he part of the omniscient narrator or the anthropologist who reifies culture--produces a distorted view of reality, however much it prenteds to objectivity.  In boht, he favors instead a focus on the interaction of subjectivities, on multiple inner points of view.  Finally, in both his art and his anthropology, Sapir treats formal givens--artistic conventions or cutlural values--as means to self-expression rather than constraints upon individual freedom.""

Aesthetic Judgement,"<p>General Notes 4/11/12</p>
<p>* Beauty and ugliness a big part of human life and so philosohpers have tried to understand those ""judgements"" and ""experiences"" and understand whether they were ""legitimate.""&nbsp; Since 18th century, much thinking on the subject had put forward a notion of ""the aesthetic"" and then in the 20th century this concept came under sharp critique.&nbsp; Zangwill thinks that this hostility to the aesthetic may have roots in ""broader cultural Puritanism, which fears the connection between aesthetic and pleasure."" (1) -- although this seems to be his particular take as perhaps someone interested in what Hegeman in her <em>Cultural Return</em> critiques as a return to the aesthetic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've sort of skipped through this article because for my present purposes it seems too ideological in the way Hegeman would suggest -- ie demanding a return to a humanist aesthetics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>His reading of Kant downplays the autonomy that Kant gave to the aesthetic realm rather strongly, choosing to elevate Kant's idea that there was a kind of universality in the objectified judgements of ""taste"".&nbsp; See p.2-5, and his section on Disinterrestedness.&nbsp; Also comments about the problematic claims of ""relativists"" on 7-8.</p>
<p>See Hegeman's <em>Cultural Return</em>, e.g. 5-6 for an account and critique of the return to ""aesthetics.""Also in a more general sesne the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy on ""Kant's Aesthetics and Teleology"" has at the start of section 2.8 on ""Aesthetics and Morality"" a brief description of the fact that the dominant interpretation has been to see Kant as granting relative autonomy to aesthetic thought, but that there are also those who ""take the demand for universal validity made<br />by a judgment of beauty to amount to a moral demand, so that Kant's argument for the universal validity of such judgments depends on an appeal to morality.""

The Metaphysical Club: A Story of American Ideas,"<p>Notes taken December 2012</p>
<p>Summary Note:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Menand roots Pragmatism deeply in the Civil War.&nbsp; For instance, for Oliver Wendel Holmes, the Civil War rids him of his strong faith in beliefs and teaches him to see strong belief as a sure path to violence.&nbsp; Menand's ethical evaluation of Pragmatism is ambivalent: he clearly admires its subtlety and sensitivity and shares its recognition of the limits of ideas, but he also is unsure of its usefulness for us today.&nbsp; It is on the one hand, as he notes in the Preface, a philosophy that supports that sense of ""perpetual upheaval"" upon which capitalism thrives; but it is also a philosophy born of a very different time: out of the indivdiualistic spiritual energies of the Second Great Awakening, out of the debate over Slavery, and out of the Civil War.&nbsp; This idea that it is a philosophy somehow foreign to us or born out of cirumstances foreign to us seems to dominate the book in a way.&nbsp; Perhaps it is only because Menand is such a good writer and is capable of evoking a feeling of this time that one gets the sense that Menand does in fact think this philosophy is born of another and very different time.</p>
<p><strong>Preface</strong></p>
<p>* M sets up significance of his pragmatic thinkers: Oliver Wendell Holmes, William James, Charles S. Pierce, and John Dewey in relationship to the Civil War.&nbsp; This war he says allowed the Republican congress to dictate policy during and after the war.&nbsp; The result was that ""[f]or more than thirty years, a strong central government protected and promoted the ascendance of industrial capitalism and the way of life associated with it -- the way of life we call 'modern.'"" (x) At the same time, however, the violence of the war seemed to suggest a failure of democracy and also a ""failure of culture, a failure of ideas."" (x)&nbsp; M compares the Civil War's impact on ""culture"" to that of WWI: it seemed to invalidate the assumptions of that culture that existed before the war.&nbsp; So he thinks that the Civil War swept away the South's slave culture, but also the North's ""intellectual culture.""&nbsp; The struggle to come up with a new set of ideas is the story he is telling about pragmatism.&nbsp; (x)&nbsp; And these were ""modern"" ideas -- ie. ideas linked to industrial capitalism and the way of life that it entailed.&nbsp; (x)</p>
<p>* He gives a brief general description of what he sees as holding these thinkers together: namely, an ""idea about ideas."" (xi):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They all believed that ideas are not ""out there"" waiting to be discovered, but are tools--like forks and knives and microchips--that people devise to cope with the world in which they find themselves.&nbsp; They believed that ideas are produced not by individuals, but by groups of individuals--that ideas are social.&nbsp; They believed that ideas do not develop according to some inner logic of their own, but are entirely dependent, like germs, on their human carriers and the environment.&nbsp; And they believed that since ideas are provisional responses to particular and unreproducible circumstances, their survival depends not on their immutability but on their adaptability."" (xi-xii)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>* He makes a sharp but limited critique of this approach to ideas.&nbsp; He notes that it was an approach to ideas that was non-ideological in that it prevented them from either ""justifying the status quo, or dictating some transcendent imperative for renouncing it"" (xii).&nbsp; He sees it as a kind of ""skepticisim"" which he says helped people ""cope"" with life in a ""heterogenous, industrialized, mass-market society, a society in which older human bonds of custom and community seemed to have become attenuated, and to ahve been replaced by impersonal networks of obligation and authority."" (xii) It was a philosphy that said something abut the limits of ideas as well as their use.&nbsp; <strong>His critique is then that such skepticism also supports the ""continual state of upheaval that capitalism thrives on."" </strong>(xii)</p>
<p><strong>Epilogue</strong></p>
<p>[Note: Dewey's <em>Experience and Nature, </em>M says, used the word experience exactly as Holmes had in his opening paragraph of <em>The Common Law</em>: ie to mean ""Culture."" And apparently Dewey said later that he wished he'd called the book <em>Culture and Nature</em>!!. (437)]</p>
<p>* The epilogue is structured around the idea that these thinkers' ideas fell out of fashion during the Cold War. M uses the death of Dewey in June 1952 and the explosion of the nuclear bomb five months later as the events which mark that transition.&nbsp; Then he asks why did this happen?&nbsp;</p>
<p>* One answer which he says is ""simple""--but which doesn't seem that way to me--is that their ideas ""became identified with the work of disciples whose stature was a lot less intimidating and whose claims struck many people as a lot more controversial."" (438).&nbsp; This is for me a very oblique sentence.&nbsp; What does he mean by ""intimidating""?&nbsp; He gives the example that Holmes' critique of formalism was taken up in the 20s and 30s by a school of jurisprudence known as Legal Realism ""whose representatives made assertions about the poltical bias in legal principles (while dropping entirely Holmes' opposition to judicial activism) that went beyond anything in Holmes."" (438)&nbsp; He notes also how Dewey's ideas were taken up to focus on ""child-ceneredness"" in progressive education that during the Cold War was seen as lacking in ""discipline and rigor."" (438)&nbsp; So this seems like the ideas were used crudely and in a narrow and simple way?&nbsp; But then he gives other examples that seem to point to somethign else.&nbsp; For example, he says that the ""therapeutic side"" of James thought that ""philophy can be motivational"" that was a product of his struggles ""with indecision and depression"" ""did not surive a transplant from a culture in which emotional restraint was counted a virtue to one in which emotional released was considered a panacea."" (439)&nbsp; This seems like a different problerm: ie that the ideas had lost their footing in the shifting ideas of the different periods?--something that certainly would itself be a subject of discussion for the pragmatist? So this is a confusing argument...</p>
<p>* Then he notes that in the pragmatists' own conception as ""modernsits"" it was reasonable that their ideas would be superceded, but he doesn't think that this what happened.&nbsp; Their ideas did not go out of fashion because they were ""unique"" he says but because they were seen as ""naive"" and ""dangerous"" in the context of the Cold War. (439)&nbsp;&nbsp; So he puts a lot of weight on the Cold War as the event causing the pragmatists' ideas to lose resonance.&nbsp; He says then that he thinks that their philosophy elevated above all others the notion of tolerance.&nbsp; He says not tolerance as in religious tolerance but ""the tolerance, say, of a piece of steel."" (440)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The pragmatists wanted a social organism that permitted a greater (though by no means unrestricted) margin for difference, but not just for the sake of difference, and not even because they thought principles of love and fairness required it.&nbsp; They wanted to create more social room for error because they thought this would give good outcomes a better change to emerge.&nbsp; They didn't just want to keep the conversation going; they wanted to get to a better place. (440)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>M stress that this was view that made compromise important.&nbsp; The compromise involved an exercise of tolerance that ultimately provided the moral justification for the dominant ideas/view that would emerge:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Though we may believe unreservedly in a certain set of truths, there is always the possibility that some other set of truth might be the case.&nbsp; In the end, we have to act on what we believe; we cannot wait for confirmation from the rest of the universe.&nbsp; But the moral justification for our actions comes frmo the tolerance we&nbsp; have shown to others ways of being in the world, other ways of considering the case.&nbsp; The alternative is force.&nbsp; Pragmastism was deseigned to make it harder for peole to be driven to vioelnce by their beliefs."" (440)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The desire to avoid violence had come from their experience in the Civil War.&nbsp; It was a way of makingB441) demcoracy non-violent again; it was a triumph of ""unionism"" he says (, by which I think he means the more conservative side of the anti-slavery movement that led up to&nbsp; the Civil War: ie not the Abolitionists.&nbsp; But all of this doesn't exactly fit with the Cold War mentality which he says was a ""war over principles."" ""The notion that the values of the free society for which the Cold War was waged were contingent, relative, fallible constructions, good for some purposes and not so good for others, was not a notion compatible with the moral imperatives of the age."" (441)</p>
<p>* M notes that the movement for civil liberties of the 50s and 60s was a movement that was based on the ""belief that every individual has an inalienable right to those freedom by virtue of being human--precisely the individualism that Holmes and Dewey felt they needed to discredit."" (441)&nbsp; He notes that MLK was no Pragmatist and that ""it is a question whether the movement he led could have accomplished what it did if its inspirations had come from Ddewey and Holmes rather than Reinhold Niebuhr and Mahatma Gandhi."" (441)</p>
<p>* Now pointing to the more recent present he notes that as soon as the Cold War ended ""the ideas of Holmes, James, Peirce, and Dewey reemerged as suddenly as they had been eclipsed."" (441) They suited the post-Cold War world in which there were a multiplicity of point of view and competing belief systems.&nbsp; Although I wonder whether he has in saying this undrestood the impact of the september 11th attacks, which seemed to have returned many in the U.S. at least to a Cold War hard-core principled metnality.&nbsp; But perhaps he is write when he says that there is a sense that no value system can finally be the right one and that pragmatism is suited to this condition.&nbsp; There has he thinks been also an elevation of an idea in political theory ""that democracy is the value that validates all other values.&nbsp; Democratic participation isn't the means to an end, in tihs way of thinking; it is the end."" (442)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* But in his last words he questions whether these ideas will be important for us.&nbsp; He says it is not yet clear, but that in fact we are a long long way from the world of these thinkers.&nbsp; (442)</p>
<p><strong>Pt. 1</strong></p>
<p>* Menand situates Oliver Wendell Holmes in the context of his father's moral conventionalism, the politics of slavery, and hsi reverence for Emerson.&nbsp; This is a complexly told story.</p>
<p>* A key point in the analysis comes when Holmes has volunteered for the Union Army, which he had done partly out of a comitement to anti-slavery politics.&nbsp; Then he is involved in an early battle that was catastrophic and in which he nearly died.&nbsp; Two thigns happened there.&nbsp; Menand says he ""road tested"" his beliefs.&nbsp; The results are contained in a quote on 37.&nbsp; Menand thinks he had found that ""he did not require a religious faith.&nbsp; Uncertainty--'I am to take a leap in the dark'--turned out to be all the certainty he needed."" (37)&nbsp; Holmes also marvelled at thew ay his mind adapted itself to the what seemed to be the fact of his imminent death and then readapted to the fact that he woud llive.&nbsp; Menand writes, partly quoting Holmes: ""'How rapidly the mind adjusts itself': the test of a belief is not immutability, but adaptability.&nbsp; Our reasons for needing reasons are always changing."" (38)</p>
<p>*&nbsp; From this point, Menand explains that Holmes had developed a new perspective, and he suggets at various stages that Holmes carefully redacted every piece of evidence in his letters and diaries that suggested at his earlier self: the one that was rigidly dedicated to heroic/transcendental ideals.&nbsp; ""The letters to his family that survive never refer explicitly to the beliefs that led Holmes to go to war in the first place; and although Holmes expressed pride in his sense of o dutay and in his own actions when they demosntrated courage, the cause fo whcih he is fighting is virtually unmentioned.&nbsp; HOlmes carefully erased every connection between his experiences as a soldier and his views as an abolitionist.&nbsp; This is not because he cahnged those views.&nbsp; It is because he changed his view of the nature of views.&nbsp; Itwas the great lesson the war had taught him, and he took pains, in later life, to make sure the record reflected it."" (38)</p>
<p>* A key figure in Holmes' experience of the war as Menand tells it is a man named Henry Abbott who was somebody who doubted his capacity to fucntion heroically ion the war, but once the war began fucntioned with outstanding bravery.&nbsp; His political views were such that he was anti-salvery and served more out of a sense of miltiaristic duty.&nbsp; (40)&nbsp; Holmes' didn't share Abbott's political views, but as he witnessed Abbott's heroism, and as he moved away from a sense that the conviction of moral right could justify war, as he began to view war as a ""hideous human waste"" (43)&nbsp; as Menand puts it, then he also started to value Abbott's ""professionalism and discipline"" as a solider, ""to admire success more than purity of faith."" (44)&nbsp; Menand includes a letter to Holmes' father who was still sanctimonious about the rigteousness of the North's cause and he dismisses it.&nbsp; In a quote on 44-45, he sees war as ""slavery's parent"".&nbsp; Menand thinks in other words that the horror of the war had begun to seem to be the consequence of convictions too strongly held.&nbsp;</p>
<p>* But Menand makes some interesting point about the relationship between Holmes' rejection of the strong moralism and humanism that he had held as a young man and which was as Menand sees it typical of the pre-war Boston world (reminder, he sees the Civil War as creating a rift with the pre-war cutlure of Boston).&nbsp; For Menand this shift ""mirrored a generatinoal shift"":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Holmes's rejection of the intellectual style of prewaqr Boston mirrored a generational shift.&nbsp; To many of the men who had been through the war, the values of professionalism and expertise were attractive; they implied impersonality, respect for institutions as efficient organizers of enterprise, and a modern and scientific attitude--the opposites of the individualism, humanitarianism, and moralism that characterized Northern intellectual life before the war.&nbsp; (59)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Menand qualifies this statement in relation to Holmes, however, stating that Holmes had not abandoned moral certitude for duty; rather he ""narrowed himself in order better to expand."" (59)&nbsp; He had not given up hope of a ""glimpse of the infinite."" (59)&nbsp; This is key. It means, in other words, that Holmes hoped that professionalism would oopen a path to the universal as he wrote Emerson, Menand notes, in 1876.&nbsp; See quote on p.59.&nbsp; Menand says that in a sense Holmes had become the ""Emerson of professionalism--or as he [Holmes] sometimes called it, 'jobbism.'"" (59)&nbsp; Menand quotes Holmes in a speech in 1886 on ""The Profession of the Law"":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If this universe is one universe, if it is so far thinkable that you can pass in reason from one part of it to another, it does not matter very much what the fact is .&nbsp; For every fact leads to every other by the path of the air. (60)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Menand quotes Holmes twice about his notion of intellectual heroism which has to do with finding a path in the wilderness, which has no clearly marked apths.&nbsp; (60-61)&nbsp; Menand writes: ""In their dedication to the task at hand, human beings make, by their deeds, tracks in the wilderness.&nbsp; The wilderness itself is trackless."" (61)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* The problem for Holmes, however, was that his idea about ideas, as the war had taught it, was that ""certitude leads to violence."" (61)&nbsp; For Holmes, it was the abolitinooists' attitudes that served as the main example of that danger, even though hne admitted that there were people who were more subtle in their thinking among the abolitionists.&nbsp; (62)&nbsp; But Holmes believed that everyone was like the abolitionists essentially.&nbsp; But the force taht could mitigate these ""competing conceptions of thew ay life shoudl be from overheating and leading to violence is democracy."" (64)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Re the politics of socialism v. liberalism, Menand says that Holmes' ""personal symathies were entirely with capitalists."" (65) His first major dsent in the U.S. Supreme Court was in <em>Northern Securities v. United States </em>(1904) where he defended J.P. Morgan and james T. Hill against antitrust legislation. (65)&nbsp; Menand says that the key to understanding Holmes' civil liberties and his poltiics was that ""he thought only in terms of aggregate social forces; he had no concern for the individual."" (65) He wrote ""Every societies rests on the deatrh o f men."" (quoted on 66).&nbsp; Menand thinks that he simply had no faith in ""individual human agency"" and viewed men like Rockefeller as those who simply had a better grasp of ""social tendencies"" (66)</p>
<p>* So then Menand's interpretation runs counter a bit to&nbsp; the legend of Holmes as a hero for progressive era reformers like Lippman and Brandeis.&nbsp; Holmes did emerge as a defender of reform and labor, but it was in the service of his interest in disintersted professionalism, on the one hand, and the idea that one should not be dogmatic, ont he other.&nbsp; ""It has given me great pleasure to sustain the Constitutionality of laws that I believe to be as bad as possible, because I thereby helped to mark the difference between what I would forbig and what the Constitution permits..."" (quoted on 67, a letter to John T. Morse.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Menand wirites that ""he believed taht every social itnerests should ahve its chance."" (67)</p>
<p><strong>Pt.2</strong></p>
<p><br /><strong>* </strong>William James -- very indecisive.&nbsp; Some biographrers blamed his father's ""mixed signals"" (75) for James character.&nbsp; But Menand thinks: ""James believed that risk-assuming decisiveness--betting on an alternative even before all the evidence is in--was the supreme mark of character.&nbsp; He thought that the universe would meet such a person halfway.&nbsp; But he also thought that certainty was moral death, and he hated to foreclose anything."" (75) Net result was that he developed a ""self-conscious impulsivity"", regularly changing his mind. (75): ""In 1903 he began the process of trying to decide to retire whether to retire.&nbsp; His diary for the fall of 1905 reads: October 26, 'Resign!'; October 28, 'Resign!!!'; November 4, 'Resign?'; November 7, 'Resign!'; Nobember 8, 'Don't resign'; November 9, 'Resign!', November 16, '<em>Don't</em> Resign!', November 23, 'Resign'; December 7, 'Don't Resign'; December 9, 'Teach here next year.' He retired in 1907."" (75-76). Santayana, who had James as a teacher and then colleague at Harvard and was ambivalent about him, wrote: ""He was so extermely natural that there was no knowing what his nature was, or waht to expect next; so that one was driven to behave and talk conventionally, as in the most aritificial society."" (77)&nbsp; James put it htis way: ""...every gush of feeling should be followed by adequate action."" (77)</p>
<p>* James' family were not part of Bost Brahimn society--being descended from Irish immigrants on both sides--but they enjoyed great socails uccess. (77)</p>
<p>* James' grandfather, also William, was a ""classic product of the Second Great Awakening. (79)&nbsp; Henry James, Sr. was a bit of a black sheep in the family and his father who was rich left him a yearly allotment of 1250, much smaller than his siblings.&nbsp; He sued and eventually got control the full sum he was due.&nbsp; He then had leisure for life and also made possible the ""unusual"" education of his sons Henry Jr. and William.&nbsp; (79)&nbsp; During the period that thew ill was in question, Henry was roaving around upsate NY drinking and gambling and then at somepoint while living in Bufallo was reborn at about the same time when he got access to the sum of his inheritance.&nbsp; Henry's religious thought taken from the Burned-over District was twofold :""an infactuation with the religious impulse and a deep aversion to religious institutions."" (81) His second conversion was to Swedenborgianism following a nervous breakdown he suffered in 1844 in which he saw, in his words, ""some damned shape squatting invisible to me within the precincts of the room, and raying out from his fetid perosnality influences fatal to life."" (quoted on 82)&nbsp; Swedenborg had an explanation for this event which had undone Henry Sr.'s sense of self-posession, Menand says.&nbsp; But what he saw in it Meandn saws was ""what he saw in every religious teaching eh was influenced by: an injunction to esshew the forms."" (82) Given his interest in the eschewing of forms, Henry Sr. was also drawn to Transcendentalism and knew Emerson, having met in NY in 1842.&nbsp; (Emerson apparently blessed William while visiting the James' house.)&nbsp; (82-83) Henry Sr. also wrote copiously, although usually funding his own publications.&nbsp; Menand says: ""James [Henry sr.] was an idiosyncratic thinker at atime--the decades before the Civil War--when the landscape swarmed with idiosyncratic religious movements.&nbsp; He belonged to a way of life and a way of thinking about life that he war and modern science rendered obsolete..."" (84)</p>
<p>* Because Henry James Sr. belonged, M thinks, to a way of thinking that the War ""rendered obsolete"" the questino of his influence on the post-War generation, post-Darwinian thinkers, including William, complex... James himself wrote ""All my intellectual life I derive from you."" from London as his father lay dying in Cambridge in 1882.&nbsp; He rpeated this sentiment many times Menand says. (84)&nbsp; Menand describes Henry James Sr. as a Platonist: ""He believed (following Swedenborg) that there are two realms, a visible and an invisible, and that the invisible realm is the real one.&nbsp; From this premise, theusual conclusions follow : humankind is now separated from the true and the real; its destiny is to arrive at the consummation intended for it by God; philosophers here ot help the rest of us understand what the consumation is."" (85)&nbsp; M says that Henry Sr. reading of this set of ideas was influenced by Swedenborg and by Charles Fourier, a thinker whom Swedenborg was often paired with in the 19th century. (85)&nbsp; In particular, Henry saw ""indepenent selfhood"", a belief in it, as an impediment to achieivng a redeemed state.&nbsp; (85)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* For William James' the monistic platonism of his father was totally alien-- that ""monistic belief in the unchanging reality of an unseen world, indifference to temporal moral distinctions, and anti-individualism..."" (88)&nbsp; James intended pragmatism as a method to subert that ""block universe"" as he put it, (quoted on 88).&nbsp; He hated the idea of ""undifferentiated oneness"" M says; and spoke of a ""pluriverse."" (88)&nbsp; And he was very invested in the power of ""individual agency"" -- so much so M says that Dewey criticized him for it.&nbsp; But James was, M says, also a ""kind of super-Protestant"".&nbsp; He ""intended pragmastism as an argument, in philosophy, for discarding obsolte virtual ritual and rejection the authority of prior use.""--ie the kind of thrusts that Protestants made. (88)&nbsp; In this sense, there was continuity between W. James and his father's thinking -- if James' pragmatism struggled against the ""block universe"" of his father and was thus part of a ""disestablishmentarian impulse in American culture--an impulse that drew strength from the writings of Emerson, who attacked institutions and conformity, and from the ascendancy, after the Civil War, of evolutionary theories, which drew attention to the continegency of all social forms,"" (89) it was also a prodct of the ""s[plintering of American Protestantism into multiple religious and quasi-religious sects over the course of the century--the protestantization, so to speak, of Protestanism."" (89)&nbsp; Here there is more continuity with Henry Sr.'s thinking.&nbsp; And M points out that in many ways James was captivated by the spiritualism that emerged out fo this splintering of protestnaism. E.g. he was fascinated by the ""mental states that suggested the existence of an extrasensory realm."" (90)&nbsp; He used hypnotism as a psychologist; experimented with drugs; submitted himself to ""mind-cure"" methods, and publicly defended their methods.&nbsp; etc etc.&nbsp; He believed he wrote near the end of his life: ""There is a continuity of cosmic consciousness against which our indivduality builds but accidental fences, andi nto which our several minds plumge as into a mother-sea of reservoir.&nbsp; Our 'normal' consciousness is circumscrbied for adaption to our external earthly environment, but the fence is weak ins pots, and fitful influences from beyond leak in, showing the otehrwise unverifiable common connection."" (quoted on 91) James' turn to an interesting in spiritualism intensified as he was finishing his first book <em>The Principles of Pscyhology </em>(1890).&nbsp; He talked about an awareness of ""split-up selves"" in a letter to his sister who was dieing from brteat cancer in London in 1891.&nbsp; (91) James himself understood this turn as a reversion to his father's interest in the spiritual.&nbsp; He however also saw his father as from a different generation, writing to his wife after his father's death: ""he was full of the fumes of the ursprünglich [primordial] human&nbsp; nature; tings turbid, more than he could formulate,&nbsp; wrought within hiim,..."" (quoted on 93) So there is continuity there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[A very interesting note here--&gt;that Henry Sr.'s reponse to the Fox Sisters was that they were of coruse communicating with spirits but that peopel should stay away.&nbsp; Spirits were like gossips and troublemakers.&nbsp; He wrote: ""They first arrest our attention by talk of those we have loved....they gradually inflme our ascetic ambitions, our ambition after spiritual distinction: and finally having got a secure hold, who knows though what pools of voluntary filth and degradation they may drag us?"" (quotede on 92)&nbsp; M notes that this conception was ""actuallky&nbsp; much closer to the Fredian idea of the subconscious and to eh premises of pscyoanalysis--which is one of the places where the therapeutic ccurrent int he spiritualist movement was ultimately directed--than his son the psychologsit was."" (92) ]</p>
<p>* Chapter ""Brazil"" deals with Aggasiz, his naturalism and his racial polygenism (he was a follower of Samuel MOrton) and how he resisted Darwinism.&nbsp; M's analysis of Darwin's thought points to Darwin as an advocate of the role of chance in determining human forms: ""chance determines their [variations] adaptive utility."" (122)&nbsp; ""The 'selection' of favorable characteristics is therefore neither designed nor progressive."" (122) Thus M says natural selection explains why changes occur, and how they occur, but ""does not dictate <em>what</em> those changes shall be.&nbsp; It is a process without mind."" (123)&nbsp; The world in Darwin's concetpion, then, was ""characterized by chance, cahnge, and difference..."" (123) It was a view of the world that not only departed from the view which related all individual differences to a ""general type"" that was fixed, dterminate, and uniforjm, but it departed from the languges oftypes and essences entirely by focusing on ""interacting individuals."" It adopted the langauge of statistics and probability. (124)&nbsp; This was a challenge to Aggfazi's view of ntural history but also his scientific method.&nbsp; Agassize resited it at every turn: p.124-128.&nbsp; In particular, he could not, M says, separate ""the phenomenal from the transcendatal: his entire system was tied to the belief that all observable order i nature is prima facie evidence of a supernatural intention.""&nbsp; (128)&nbsp; Where Darwin did not believe that the word species spefied actually types, but rather a term of convenience used to refer to a set of indivduals that resembled each other (see 123), Aggasiz&nbsp; believed that species were ""categories of thought embodied in individual living forms,' and that natural history was ulimately 'the analysis of the thoughts of the Creator of the Universe, as manifested in the animal and vegetable kingdoms.'""( 128)&nbsp; After 1860 this viewpoint left Aggasize alienated in Cambridge. (128)</p>
<p>* Section 4 of the Brazil chapters shows James' reaction to Aggasiz and to Darwinism.&nbsp; TJames had gone an expedition with Aggasiz to Brazil. The point generally was that James was a Darwinian, but not a Darwinist.&nbsp; Ie he did not view Darwin's theory as a law, and he critiqued Huxley and Herbert Spencer's use of it, while seeing more value in it than Aggasiz's view of natural history.&nbsp; (141)&nbsp; The point here more genearlly is that James read Darwin in a way that emphasized the openness of the theory.&nbsp; He thought people had misread the book in two ways:</p>
<p>1) They had read it as sayign that science was indepdnent of the society's interest or value.&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;</em>The usual critique of anti-Darwinists is that they confuse science and belief, but for James the problem was that their was a disjunction, as with Aggasiz who's ""science wasn't theoretical and his theory wasn't scientific."" (141)&nbsp; Ie they collected data without a hypothesis to guide them.&nbsp; The advantage of Darwin's theory in James' view was that it was a theory/hypothesis that was seeminly prepared to deal with what observation revealed about nature: namely, that it was full of contingency and chance, or what James referred to as caprice.&nbsp; In a review of Darwin's book on <em>The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domesication</em>, James wrote: ""the only 'law' under which the greater mass of the facts the author has brought together can be grouped seems to be that of Caprice,--caprcie in inheriting, caprice in transmitting, caprice everwhere, in turn.&nbsp; To look for laws at all in the chaos seems absurdly presumptious."" (142)&nbsp;&nbsp; The advantage of the theory, that James viewed as descriptive and historical and not psychological, was that it anticipated the idiosyncracies in nature and its theory was reinforced by the mounting evidence of such idiosyncracies. (142)</p>
<p>2) The ssecond error was that many and esp. Spencer believed that evolutionary science could ""lay a foundation for norms--that natural selection serves as a kind of 'bottom-line' aribeter of merit."" (142-3)&nbsp; It tries to make the ""logic of evolution the logic of human values."" (Menand quotes, 142-143).&nbsp; For James, evolutionary thinking was just one hypothesis, ""good in some situations, not so good in others, and not...a basis for human values.""&nbsp; (145)&nbsp; M quotes James on 144-145 in a review of Darwin's <em>The Variation of Animals...</em> seeing a tendency in James to be comfortable with a hierarchical coneption of race and also doubting that people's views on race were at all scientific. (144-145).&nbsp; Indeed, in James' view the point of Darwin's theory [and this is like Kroeber!!] is that at some point evolutionary theory had given humans minds thereby realeasing them from, as M puts it, the ""prison of biology."" (146)&nbsp; [Kroeber said we had then become ""inscribable.""] We made choices and created value systems!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Ultimately this view of science and Darwinian thought shaped James' view of the Civil War.&nbsp; Unlike Henry Adams--M points out had used evolutionary theory ""for fun"" even though he regarded it as unproved--who saw the war as part of a struggle for survival, James saw it as having another layer.&nbsp; M writes that if it was just a struggle for surival than it had no more importance than what beak was selected for among finches.&nbsp; But because it was a human war, it was moral!&nbsp; (14 6) His brother Wilky had been terribly wounded in the war.&nbsp; When&nbsp; James was asked to give a speech for a memorial erected in Boston to Robert Gould Shaw,t the man who led teh fifty-fourth and died at Fourt Wagner, James was thinking of Wilky M thinks, and what he said was that what as heroic was not the fight, fo rhtat was just an animal isntinct, but rather the civic courage that Shaw and his brother showed.&nbsp; (147-148).</p>
<p>Pt. 3 (Charles Peirce)</p>
<p>* William James new Charles Peirce at the Lawrence Scientific School and found him provocative.&nbsp; Peirce was a college graduate (unlike James) and a prodigy in science, mathematics, and philosophy.&nbsp; Charles Peirce did not distance himeself from the views of his father, Benjamin Peirce.&nbsp; Menand describes this put Charles Peirce in a particular position: that of ""adapting the worldview of science before Darwin to post-Darwinian thought--adapting, that is, a view predicated on the presumption that there is certainty in the universe to views predicated on the presumption that there is not."" (152)&nbsp; Menand writes that the ""task was impossible"" but that in the process of failing at that--a failure reinforced by proefssional difficulties and ""temperamental idiosyncracies""--he left many brilliant insights.</p>
<p>* His father's views: B. Peirce viewed mathematics as the most important science.&nbsp; He was also one of the first internationally recognized American mathematicians.&nbsp; For Peirce the world was knowable because our minds were designed to know it and with reference to this belief Peirce called himself an ""idealist"" (156) E.g.:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In every form of material manifestation...thre is a corresponding form of human thought, so that the human mind is as wide in its range of thought as the physical universe which it thinks.&nbsp; The two are wondrfully matched. (156)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Within this belief, he viewed mathematics as the fundamental language of all forms of inquiry, scientific or otherwise.&nbsp; (156)&nbsp; E.g.:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mathematics is the science which draws necessary conclusions...It deduces from all its consequences, and develops them into the suitable form for comparison with observations, and thereby measures the strength of the argument from observations in favor of a proposed law or of a propose form of application of a law. (155-5)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Menand explains this well on 155.&nbsp; Basically, the points is that Peirce believed that our lack of understanding of a single law had not to do with the lack of a law, but with the imperfection of our observations.&nbsp; In relation to this problem, math was the ""language in which hypotheses can [could] be formulated most accurately, and their limits thereby ascertained.&nbsp; Mathematics tells us, based on what we do know, what we are entitled to infer about what we don't know."" (155)</p>
<p>* These beliefs about the fixity of the world and humans' capacity to understand it were similary to Aggasiz's and the two were friends.&nbsp; Indeed, by the 1840s, Aggasiz and Peirce along with others Alexandar Dalles Bache and Charles Henry Davis had become a force shaping the development of science.&nbsp; They took over the Association of American Geologists and Naturalists in 1848, makign membership more selective, and changing the name to the American Association fo rthe Advancement of Science. (156-158).</p>
<p>* C. Peirce was Benjamin's second of five children.&nbsp; Suffered from facial neuralgia and used opium as a painkiller.&nbsp; Later in life he used morphine and cocaine.&nbsp; He had a personality that he characterized as reckless selfish indulgent etc and much of his lfie was a cycle of indulgence and self-rebuke.&nbsp; (159)&nbsp; He was, like his father, opposed to abolitionism and hated the radical republican senator Charles Sumner.&nbsp; (161)</p>
<p>* Menand tells a long story about the so-called Howland Case or <em>Robinson v. Mandell </em>in which Benjamin was called as an expert witness to try to discover whether Hetty Robinson had falsified as will document in order to acquire more of an inheritance.&nbsp; They used a statistical method and the ""law of errors"" to try to discern the answer.&nbsp; The answer that the Peirce's gave was irrelevant, but the case remained controversial because of their use of this new seemingly disinterested mathematical ""law of errors"" that many people found ""distressing"" Menand says.&nbsp; (163-176)</p>
<p>* The ""law of errors"" M says was ""one of the most far reachign inventions of the nineteenth century"" and central to Charles Peirce's thought. (176)&nbsp; This law was rooted in the convergence of probabiliyt theory andstatistics.&nbsp; The law of errors held that statistics were probabalistic.&nbsp; This is explained on 177-182.&nbsp; If you make a series of measurements there are discrepancies.&nbsp; But if you don't know the cause of the discrepancies then you don't know which measurements are accurate and which are not.&nbsp; But Abraham de Moivre discvoered in 1738 that when you throw a pair of die you will get a triangular curve with 7 has the highest point and declining on either side (because the sum 7 is reached by the greatest number of combinations of outomces on the die (1+6; 2+5; 3+4).&nbsp; ""The basis of the law of errors in astronomy was the discovery that multiple observations of a star tended to conform to a bell-shaped curve (not triangular because an infinite number o fresults is possible)--as does any group of measrements of a fixed object."" (179) Therefore a series of attempts to measrue the location of a star will form a mean and that mean is the most likely location of the star.&nbsp; <br />This theory was developed by Carl Friedrich Gauss, Adrien Marie Legendre, and Pierre-Simon Laplace in the 18th century and early 19th century.&nbsp; Laplace got most of the credit.&nbsp; The upshot of the theory, as M puts it, was that it ""did not ignore errors; it quantified them."" (182)&nbsp; This was how the Peirce's used it in the HOwland case.&nbsp; They asked what are the chances that we are wrong in assuming that Howland traced the signature?&nbsp; What in other words was the chance that she produced a very similar signature by chance?&nbsp; The answer he thought was 5 to the 30th.&nbsp; (see 171-172).&nbsp; The power of this as Menand put it was that ""[b]y uncoupling the idea of precision from the idea of a single absolute value"" statistics made greater precision possible.&nbsp; Statistics ""conquered uncertainty by embracing it."" (182) An even greater significance of this law was that there was an order underlying seemingly random events, and Laplace for example believed that such probabilistic statistical thinking could be applied to human life as well as the physical natural world.&nbsp; (183-184).</p>
<p>* It was a frenchman Adolphe Quetlet that took up the project of using statitics to think about human life starting in the 1820s.&nbsp; He applied statistics to murder rates, finding taht the nubmers of murders were relatively constant.&nbsp; Higher and lower totals each year were ""errors"".&nbsp; He wrote a book <em>Sur l'homme et le developpement de ses facultes</em> in which he showed patterns--this was ""social physics"" he said.&nbsp; ( 187-188).&nbsp; The two points he drew out were 1) that because of such patterns the moral responsiblity for crime lay not with the individual but with the society (188); 2) the idea of the l'homme moyen, the average (or ""mean"") man.&nbsp; (188-189), who he noted was to the nation the way the ""center of gravity was to a planet."" (188).&nbsp; Quetlet also used this theory to determine the average chest size of Scottish men...deducing that there was such a chest size.&nbsp; The cause of the mean he found were the envirionmental conditions of the scottish nation, he assumed.&nbsp; Thsi explanation challeneged the polygenist racialism of Samuel Morton and Aggasize because it treated the existence of ""types"" acs the prodcut of social and environmental conditions and not as providential types. Indeed, Quetlet applied his theory to racial types and found that ""major features of the human species"" were ""pretty much the same."" (190)</p>
<p>* Quetlet's findings were often ignored, but Thomas Buckle picked them up, applying them to British social forms in the History of British Civilization ( 1857)...this was in his view history written from a statistical piont of view . ( 191) Statistics afforded Buckle the license to view history as totally deterministic.&nbsp; He saw marriage rates and corn prices as determined by patterns. (194) But he also used it nationalistically to justify British civilaition--and European--as the best.&nbsp; (194-5)</p>
<p>*&nbsp; There were a couple of consequences of this way of thinking: 1) It removed all political social responsiblity of Euroepans for non-Europeans...&nbsp; Ie African Americans' positions could be scene as the product of statistical patttern somehow inherit to their ""national type."" 2) It made the world seem ordered.&nbsp; Darwin's popularity was in line with this tendency: his theory seemed to suggest order underlying chance.&nbsp; Thus this way of thinking was used to justify the status quo,and most of the hard-core statistical thinkers were economic laissez-faire liberals.&nbsp; Buckle praised Adam Smith's <em>The Wealth of Nations</em> copiuosly, and Spencer titled his jsutification of laissez-faire <em>Social Statistics</em> (1851).&nbsp; IE what statitics seemed to prove, M says, is that the ""market was not , as people like Matthew Arnold complained, an invitation to anarchy.""

Metahistory: the Historical Imagination in Nineteenth-Century Europe,"<p>Notes taken for Meta Crisis Paper 4/12:</p>
<p>From his Preface:</p>
<p>* 19th century historical thought he says was ""working out of the possibilities of tropological prefguration of the historical feild contained in poetic language in general."" (xii)&nbsp; Tropological has to do with moral tropes and figurative language.&nbsp; Trope is figurative non-literal use of words, ie ""it was a cakewalk.""&nbsp;</p>
<p>* White thinks it was the working out of these possibilities that produced an ""Ironic condition of mind.""&nbsp; ie a ""crisis of historicism"".&nbsp; (xii) And that ironic condition of mind has prodcued in turn a kind of ""theoretical torpor"" in professional historigoraphical writing and a ""numerous rebellions against historical consciousness"" in the literature, science and philsophy of the 20th century.&nbsp; (xii)</p>
<p>(Skipping here to Ch. 7, ie first chapter in pt.3, ""The Repudiation of 'Realism' in Late Nineteenth Century Philosophy of History"")</p>
<p>Ch. 7: Historical Conscioisuness and the Rebirth of Philosphy of History</p>
<p>* Chapter is about rejection of ""realiism"" and rebirth of ""philosophy of history"".&nbsp; First three pages about how philsophy of history was regarded as too fanciful and philosophic, full of distortions in much nineteenth century historical thought.&nbsp; Hegel reversed this, or tried to, but Hegel's distinction not taken up.&nbsp; Inistead more central a line tht distinguished between 1) ""true"" history, 2) ""philosophy of history"" (what had to have happened), and 3) doctrinaire history (what ought to have happened). (267-268)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Then White traces a ""main line"" (269) of historical reflection that ordered historires according to ratioanl traditions o rideological positions.&nbsp; He's talkking about sureys of history by Feuter, Gooch, and Croce.&nbsp; (268-269)&nbsp; What these surveys all avoided were the Critiques of Marx and Nietzsche.&nbsp; They acknowledged the failure of philosophy of history to provide general laws or even rules for historical method. (270)&nbsp; Fueter for example ""looked forward hopefully"" to a historical work that would do ""what Darwin's work had done for biology and ethnology, while Gooch stressed the work yet to be donein drawing the different traditions of historiographical work together, so that general scientific principles of historical analysis might be constructed."" (270)&nbsp; But only Croce, White said, was able to recognize that if philosophy of history was ""unable to serve as the general science or theory of historiography"" then the princples would hav eto come from the historiographical tradaitions istelf, that had been generated White notes by ""the nineteenth century's hostility to modern science, philosophy, and art..."" (270)--ie from historicism??&nbsp;</p>
<p>*&nbsp; He sees an early attempt to do just that by the Prussian historian J.G. Droysen in 1868 in his <em>Historik: Vorlesungen über Enzklopädie und Methodologie der Geschichte</em>.&nbsp; The goal of the book White says was to do ""what Aristotle had done in his <em>Topic </em>for dialectic, in his <em>Logic</em> for demonstration, in his <em>Rhetoric</em> for oratory, and in his <em>Poetric </em>for literary art.""&nbsp; (270)&nbsp; White thinks that he ""anticipated the 'crisis of historicism' into which historical thinking would be plunged by the very success of nineteenth-century historiography and the kinds of second thoughts about history's claims to the status of science advanced by thinkers like Feuchte, Croce, and Gooch in the decade preceeding World War I.""&nbsp; (270)&nbsp; Droysen like W. Humboldt and Ranke in the first half of the nineteenth century, Droysen saw historiography as being its own autonomous field of study distinct from positivistic science, idealistic philosophy, and romantic art.&nbsp; But he was writing in an atmospher ein which positivism had been given new life by Darwin and could not be simply viewed as the product of an ""outmoded enthusiasm for rationalism and mechanistic modes of explanation..."" (271)&nbsp; At the same time , Romantic art through realism in the novel had softened itself and so was less of a threat.&nbsp; The principle threat thus seem to come from calls for the ""scientization of history"" from Marxists, positivists, and social darwinists. (271)&nbsp; So it made sense that his response was to admit of the similarity of history to art as a way to ""assert at once the <em>objectivity</em> of historiography and its difference from the <em>science</em> of <em>his own time</em>."" (271)&nbsp; In doinig so, he was able, White says, to account for the ""different interpretations of the same set of events which a half-century of 'objective' historiography had produced, while at the same time asserting their status as real contributions to knowledge."" (271)&nbsp; He thus insisted that ""historians necessarilz give partial and fragmentary accounts of the past, depending on the way they cut into the historical field..."" but he said the ways they cut in were limited to four types ""each of which illuminated a different area of historical existence..."" (271)&nbsp; White describes Droysen's scheme on 271-273. Basically, he divided the process of writing history in to three parts: selecting materials (methodik, ormethod of investigation), systematic analysis of materials (systemik), and the techniques of representation (topik).&nbsp; The last was where the payoff came and he laid out four modes of represetnation: Interrogative, didactic, discussive, and recitative... . (272)&nbsp; He preferred the recitative which was he said ""to set forth the results of investigation as a course of events in imitation [Mimesis] of its actual development.&nbsp; It takes the results [of investigation] and shapes them into an image of the genesis of the historical facts upon which the investigation has been at work..."" (quoted on 272, bracketed insertions by White).&nbsp; But he did not mean that this was an allowing of the events to speak for themselves because they were dumb without the interpreter and he thought that it was not the historian's&nbsp; goal to be objective, but rather the process of ""seeking to understand."" (272)&nbsp; Understanding itself manifested itself in four forms: biographical, monographic, catastrophic, and pragmatic.&nbsp; (272)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* This whole presentation of Droysen, though, is just a way to set up that this ""fourfold"" schema that keeps cropping up is not surprising.&nbsp; It can be explained White thinks by the fact that the whole of nineteenth century intellectual cutlure can be broken down into Romanticism, Idealism, Naturalism, and Symbolism, and each of the categories within this rconceptions of history represent the ""different world views represnted by these movements projected onto the problem of historical knowledge and extended to the historical field so as to produce four conflicting coneptions of history which the analysts of the age attempted to characterize in their own various schemata of classification."" (274)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* But then what White wants to do is get beyond these to ""another mode of characterization that will identify their <em>shared</em> preconceptions, so as to show them to be members of a single family of values and atittudes toward history, and at the same time to illuminate the differences of stress and subordination among them that make them different phases of, or variations on, the single tradition.&nbsp; of thought they represent."" (274) IN order to do that he wants to return to his ""original formulation"" of historical thought as a probem of how to ""construct a verbal model of the historical process..."" (274)&nbsp; So that means there are four new levels: lixicon, grammar, syntax, and semantic.&nbsp; (274)&nbsp; So histories are attempts to use language to ""constitute different universes of discourse in which statements about the meaning of history in general or on different segments of the whole historical process can be made."" (274)&nbsp; Given that, White notes that he thinks the importance a given historian gives to ""one or another of the different operations necessary for the constituting of a comprehensive 'language of historical discourse'"" (274) will also generate ""different conceptions of the historian's task...."" (274)&nbsp; This is his way of begijnning to get behind or under the assesment of the values and models used by nineteenth century historians.&nbsp; So he says if a historain concentrates on the ""lexical level"" that might be considered as one extreme that would tend to produce chronicles.&nbsp; (274-5).&nbsp; If a historian, on the other hand, pushes ""too rapidly through to the detection of the ultiating meaning (semantics) of the whole historical field"" this will tend to produce philosophies of history.&nbsp; "" (275)&nbsp; From this he says that if he sees lexical operations on one pole an semantics on the other than the ninteenth century emphasis on ""true"" history ""would have to be located somewhere between these two extremes, on the <em>grammatical level</em>, where general classifiatory o perations predominate and representation of the synchronic structure of the historical field is aimed at, or on the <em>syntactical level</em>, where the dynamics of the field considered as a process would be the principal object of analysis and representation of the diachronic dimensions of historical being would be apprehended."" ( 275)&nbsp; He restates this a bit more on 275.</p>
<p>* The point of setting this model up is to say that what the nineteenth century historians who favored ""true"" history meant was a kind of history that was ""a kind of discourse which falls between the emptiness of chronicle"" and philosophy of history. Ie: ""any account of the past in which the events that occupied the historical field were properly named, grouped into species and classes of a distinctively 'historical' sort, and futher realted by general conceptions of causation by which changes in their relationships could be accounted for.""&nbsp; (275) This modle presupposed an ""idea or notion of the nature of the historical field and its processes"" ie it <em>implied</em> a philosophy of history.&nbsp; But this philosophy of history would be present only in a ""'displaced' , sublimated, or sublated"" form.&nbsp; There were then critique sof specific accounts that would accuse those accounts of being ""ideological"" ie of having a philosophy of history.&nbsp; But because there was no way to arbitrate between the different modes of explanation or emplottment (ie the ones that he provides), then there was only a sense of the ""richness"" of the field in relation to the variety of accounts.&nbsp; And historiography derived integrity only from ""its resistence to any impulse either to move to the level of outright conceptulization of the historical field, as the philsopher of history was inclined to do, or to fall into apprehensions of chaos as the chronicler did."" (276)&nbsp;</p>
<p>*&nbsp; In relation to that characterization of history, philosphy of history was preceived as a threat because it ""impelled to make explicit the explanatory and narrative strategies that remain implicit in the work of the professional historiographer."" (276)&nbsp; This point was brought home by both Marx and Nietzsche!&nbsp; who critiqued professional historiography savagely, noticing that its disciplinarization meant a banning of certain ""kinds of explanatory concepts on the one hand and the use of certain modes of emplotment on the other."" (276)&nbsp; This made Marx and Nietzsche particularly radical because unlilke say Comte or Buckle, who ""sought to import ideas and techniques of representation from the fields of art and science into history,"" (277) Marx and Nietzsche were challenging the ""conceptions of art and science from which the entire high culture of the nineteenth century received its form and on the basis of which it preconceived the problem of relating sceince to art."" (277)&nbsp; They were suggesting that it had become ""rule-governed"" (277) and based on orthodoxy.&nbsp; (277)&nbsp;&nbsp; What they were doing, White insists, was taking up Hegel's ""injunction to transform the insights of the different kinds of Reflective history into a basis for a genuinely Philosophical history , a history which now only <em>knows</em> something about the historical process but knows <em>how</em> it knows it, and is able to <em>defend</em> its way of knowing in philosophically justifiable terms."" (277)&nbsp; Analysis re Hegel continues onto 278.</p>
<p>*&nbsp; But what they achieved he thinks was ""little more than a theoretical justification for the alternative modes of historical reflection worked out by Michelet, Ranke, Tocqueville, and Burckhardt considered as members of a single tradition of lingusitic practice."" (278)&nbsp; What he seems to mean is that they just worked out a justification of a different historical tradition that was ensnared in the same modes of representation and eplotment.&nbsp; He says that Marx's real goal was to ""show how the divisions and conflicts of&nbsp; history can be sublated in such a way that the next stage of human development can be realistically conceived as a field of Synecdochic unities.&nbsp; In short, Marx's purpose was to translate Irony into Tragedy and, ultimately, Tragedy into Comedy."" (278)&nbsp; Nietzsche by contrast viewed Comedy and Tragedy ironically he says.&nbsp; He unmasked their myhtic nature and the mythic nature of science wso as to unmask the will, where there was nothing but an ironic condition of chaos and uncertainty, and he wanted to emplot history, White says, as ""a drama of human self-transcendent and invidiual redemption, though the redemption was not from an iron-bound 'nature' or <em>to </em>a terrifying transcendental deity, but <em>from man himself</em>, man as he has been in history, to man <em>as he might be</em> in his self-reconciled condition."" (279)&nbsp; Both Marx and Nietzsche were imagining a ""liberation from history that was simultnaoeusly a liberation from society."" (279)&nbsp; But in Nietzsche's case that was not a ""revived human community; it was, rather, a purely individual, possible for the Superman but denied to the herd..."" (279) He notes that they were both ""supreme optimists"" wheras Ranke and Tocqueville or Bourckhardt had no room for optiism.&nbsp; Finally, Marx focused on the mode of explanation that ought to be used; whereas Nietzsche focused on the mode of emplotment...(279) But for neither of theme was there any kind of f value´-free grond for explanation or emplotment...</p>

Beyond Separate Spheres: Intellectual Roots of Modern Feminism,"p.057-62 Dewey and   Origins of the ""New Psychology""

Hume's ideas that the mind was merely passive receiver of ""impressions.""  Troubling to many.  But philosophers in 1880s and 1890s were willing to deal with this idea.  Of mind as a ""passive machine.""   They went to Germany, influenced by Wundt, to focus on an empirical study of what the mind did (and not just on a debate about what or was not innate in the mind).  Measured sensation, preception, reaction times, attention, feeling... (58-59).  G. Stanley Hall one of the first.  Dewey encountred G. Stanley Hall and these ideas that Hall broughtfrom Germany impacted him.  at a time when he still held his religious views.  But Dewey was still troubled by idea of mind as mere passive thing.  He was ealry on influenced by Hegel,b ut he ""gradually ...came to believe that his view of the mind as at one with its environment did not need the vocabulary or metaphysics of hegel to ifnd expression..."" (60) He drew on Darwinism and the analysis of humans a part of nature.  This combination of Evolutoinoism, Hegeliansim, and empirical New Pscyhology freed him from his religious belief.  He had abandoned Congregational Church by the time he left Michicagn.  Dewey's peers Geroge Herbert Mead, James Tufts, and James Angell also pushed him towar empiricism and then ultimatley to see the world in organic terms., to sutdy the mind in its social context.  (61)  So he and his colleagues did not conceive of the mind in universal terms (62)   One relevant outcome for this book: ""The withering skepticism of the German experimentalists and adaption of the Darwinists provided ammunition, in the hands of those incluineed to use it, for criticizing the social context in which minds deeloped, as well as for supporting the belief that minds are capable of rising above their social context.""

<p>Leta Hollingworth was one of the few women to struggle for a Columbia doctoral degree in psychology.  She began in 1911. Women were not welcome at Columbia in particular (compared to western colleges where Hollingworth and her husband had attended.)  In 1891, Columbia turstees had modifed their ban on women in the shcool ""delegating indivual graduate faculties the power to eroll women as auditors."" (86)  The faculty of political science voted to not allow women, but the philosophy faculty which offered psychology courses had allowed female ""visitors"" to audit.  Margaret Floy Washburn in this way ""visisted James McKeen Cattell's laboratory in 1891-2,"" although she had left to Cornell after she relaied that she would not be albe ot earn a degree.  In 1893, Barnard opened as an undergraduate college in 1889 and offered some graduate work ""with the help of a few moonlighting professors,"" (86) but it was not until 1898 when Teachers Colelge became part of Columbia that the university offered graduate work in educational psyhology, and then in 1900 when Colubmia took over all graduate work from Barnard that women became ""regular students in Columbia's graduate degree programs."" (86)  By 1906 women made up half of the student body in the faculties of philsophy and one third in all other faculties, includiing poli sci and pure science in which women were barred from certain classes.  In some instances, school chose to teach certain classes twice for menand women feeling that certain subjects cold not be discussed fully with women presenct (87).  IN 1906, 160/year were enrolling in adanced philosophy, spychology, and anthropology courses.  (87)  Only two had earned a PhD however.  Of the twelve fellowships avaialble, none were open to women.  Of the thirty two fellowships for tuition alone ($150), women could apply for only four.</p>
<p>In addition, Columbia faculty and adminstration had no faith in woen's intellectual abilities.  Dean Perry, the dean of philosophy, for example worte the following:</p>
<p>""In most cases the women make good students, and some of them the best we have had i the School of Philosophy...but on the whole, I think, a smaller proportion of them than of the men are capable, either by natural endowment or opportunity, of undertaking really advanced or original work, and the porportion of them who reach the doctorate is almost pathetically small."" (quoted on 880.</p>
<p>James McKeen Cattell was also opposed to women's educaiton and wrote about his opposition in the magazine <em>Popular Science Monthly</em> in 1909.  Referring to the rising number of women employed as teachers (he said 400,000 in the US)  he wrote: ""The vast horde of female teachers in the United States tends to subvert both the school and the family."" (89)</p>
<p>Some of the younger faculty, such as Edward Thorndike, were more ""temperate in their views about the evils of educaitng women..."" (90)  Rosenberg points out the difference in that thornike wanted to promote Naomi Norsworthy, the first woman graduate studnet in Psychology.  In 1902 he had appoited her to assist him at Teachers College.  Thorndike perceived her role as taking off the burden of teaching from him (as he said in a letter to William James) (90).  Six years later he wanted to promote her to assistant professor and Cattell objected.  Thorndiek in tur argued that Teachers College ""had special needs that coudl be best met by women..""  The school was both graduate school and proessional school he described in quote on 90 and Norsworthy and women in general were best stuied to each ""in certain lines (e.g. elementary  methods, kindergarten, domestic art)...""

Class Expression versus Social Control? A Critique of Recent Trends in the Social History of 'Leisure',"<p>00 Summary 00  Jones is making a critique of the trends in Social History's analysis of the Leisure.  Primarily, he is irritated in the way it has been used to emphasize the rationalization and organization of leisure (in contrast to what are often described as ""traditional"" means of entertainment) as an unintentional product of the activities of bourgeois elites, in ways that neutralized the political development of a revolutionary culture among the working classes.     Here is Jones description: ""The greed and private vices of capitalists, unbeknownst to them, create increasingly effective mechansims of dousing, channelling or diverting the class consciousness of workers, since the most effective agency of social  control is the capitalisation of  the leisure market.  What ever the status of this argument, it is certainly not marxist, for, like Adam Smith, it restricts  capitalism to the market place; and it assumes that ideologies prevalent within the working class will not, in any fundamental sense, be articulations of their productive relationships within capitalism, but the restult of their position as a consumer of leisure.""  (165)  Jones identifies the problem in terms the sloppy use by social historians of the sociological term of ""social control,"" and he analyses the construction of this term first by E.A. Ross and then Talcott Parsons.    He then connects the whole notion of social control as it is used to the idea of bourgeois hegemony (Gramsci e.g.).  ""...social control invites us to think o f a process of 'incorporation,' accomodation', 'bourgeoisification'; or if one wishes to stress some revolutionary credential, one might call it ' bourgeois hegemony'..."" (168)  And the problem with such temrs he says is ""that although they may register some moral distance from the apologetic complacency of functionalist theory, they in now way break form its theoretical linkages."" (168)   The problem he identifies is partly enabled among historians he thinks by studying leisure in isolation from work.  That is he think that the battles over lesiure were often ""epilogues"" of battles over work in the 19th century.  (169) IN other words, leisure shifted as work patterns shifted.  And he points out that here it was complicated b/c just as worker movements were not necessarily opposed to rationalization of production, they were also not consistently opposed to rationalization and organization of lesiure activities.  The second critique is the overpoliticization of leisure. He thinks that leisure was in fact about enjoying oneself, so not necessarily seen by workers as an important site of political resistance.

"The Soul's Economy: Market Society and Selfhood in American Thought, 1820 - 1920","<p>p.01-12  Book's Argument as presented in Intro</p>
<p>Sklansky's book is an analysis of a ""shift in American social thought that played a defining part in the development of industrial capitalism."" (1)  Begins with antebellum critics of ""conventional views of selfhood and society"" (1), moves through postbellum large-scale industrialization and cultural crisis it provokes which is ""seen in popular demands to reform th emonetary system, elite attempts to reorganize the system of poor relief, and espeically efforts across the political spectrum to reconceive the system of potlicia economy born of the Revolutionary Era."" (1)  Finally, moves to  creation of professions and a new ""social economics"" and new view of common law.  (1)</p>
<p>What shift is sklansky talking about?  He's talking about the shift away from a theory of selfhood and society, a ""science of society"" as he calls it, that defined selfhood and citizenship in relation to property ownership.  He describes this ""science"" succinctly on p.5.  What emerges is increasingly a tendency to seek to ""transcend"" this science and to redefine selfhood as a distinctly ""social"" thing, not linked to property ownership and individual sovereignty.  As Sklansky puts it in relatoin to the calls by followers of Henry Care during the Civil War who called for ""access to cash and credit instead of equal rights to factories and fields, ""[s]uch claims entailed rethinking the basic principle of classical political economy that the distribution of income depended upon the destribution of the means of production, not the means of exchange."" (7)  He explains this transition in detail on 5-8.</p>
<p>Sklansky criticizes this transition.  He's trying to point out the pitfalls of this kind of progressive thinking.  A big part of his critique is rooted in the eclipse of discussion of economic inequality in the late twentieth century that he describes on 1-2, a time in which many suggested that the categories of wealth and income, of class, and social equality had become meaningless in the context of globalizaiton and talk of the ""new economy."" He compares these claims to the period that is the subject of his book, noting that such claims might have seemed familiar to those of the Gilded Age.  ""..then, as now, the political and economic reconstruction underway was so profound as to appear to undermine the very concepts of property and power that had so long informed egalitarian calls for redistribution."" (2) And it is this sense of the idea that conditions had led to the transcendence of categories that were the basis for calls of equality based on property that he is wary of.  He's making a plea for the preservation of such ideas.  He's maybe sympathetic with Marxist theory (as seen for instance in his concern that economics departed fromthe notion of ""natrual"" or use value, p. 9).</p>
<p>There is a tenous balance in this book.  He (in a way that I also assocaite with Habermas' analysis of the Public Sphere) also notes the negative-postivie valence of these shifts.  He notes that historians have vindicated the suspicion of an ""avante-garde of abolitionists, feminists, trade unionists, and osical scientists"" who felt that ""attacks upon the commodification of labor as well as consumer goods seemed inextricably bound up with a doomed defense of patriachal privilege against the socializing force of the free market."" (4)  That is these defenses of the conventional view of selfhood and society as rooted in property ownership and individual soveriegnty were seen increasingly as reactionary.  This verdict he says has been upheld by contemporary historians: ""By eroding the asis of individual autonomy in men's mastery of their households, the argumetn goes, capitalist develpoment led poeple to define themselves in less individualistic, paternalistic, and parochial terms, fostering more inclusinve notions of personal identity and social solidarity."" (12, see also his f.n. 11, he cites Sacvan Bercovitch too).  It's this idea of the liberating effects of commercialism and the new notions of selfhood associated with it that he dislikes because he thinks this analysis elides and makes impossible any ""systemic challenge to capitalist imperatives."" (4)  It celebrates the ""subversive power of corporate and consumer consciousness"" but without noticing the ways ""in which the irreverent, protean, footloose spirit celebrated...has sustained market relations in the very act of subverting them..."" (4)  So the blaance of his arguemnt is evdient int his sentence: ""A central premise of htis book, however, is that nineteenth-century concerns about property and sovereignty amounted to something more than fear of progress, while twentieth-century notions of interdependence and social selfhood represented something less than an unambiguous advance upon outdated ideals.""

Blind Date,"<p>Some Brief Notes 7/28/2011:</p>
<p>Read Louis Menand review of the new version of <em>Multiculturalism: Examing the Politics of Recognition</em> that is built around Taylor’s essay on the Politics of Recognition.&nbsp; A very good article.&nbsp; The main point of the article is that the point of the book is to bend liberalism to multiculturalism, whereas Menand thinks that the lesson it provides is that this is not doable.&nbsp; The dry, procedural, value-less character of liberalism is incommensurable with multiculturalism’s rich and emotional investments with “culture.” “Culture is appealing to liberals because it sounds like a rich, vibrant, human thing, all loaded up with values, but without any of the supernatural connotations of the terms like belief or faith or the inner life—terrifyingly unglamorous things liberalism would, of course, be caught dead before going out with.”&nbsp; (81) So Menand thinks the courtship that this volume is trying to encourage between liberalism and multiculturalism is going to fail, and he finds that view seconded most soundly by Appiah’s entry in the volume—although all the authors reject Taylor’s proposals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Appiah’s and Menand’s problems ultimately lie with culture.&nbsp; The first point that Appiah puts well in a quote that Menand uses is that: “Between the politics of recognition and the politics of compulsion, there is no bright line.”&nbsp; (quoted on 79).&nbsp; In other words, people are usually defining themselves against and not with their culture, and this is a point that is, Menand observes, consistent with the dialogical conception of identity that Taylor espouses.&nbsp; (79-80).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second problem is with the ambiguity of the concept of culture itself.&nbsp; Here Menand’s writing is really good.&nbsp; His point is twofold: Yes, humans produce culture, but it has not particular “valence.”&nbsp; Despite this, when culture is taken up philosophically it acquires a “discreteness found nowhere in experience.” (80)&nbsp; There was a rush to de-reify the individual (Taylor’s monolog notion of identity) and yet in the process, he observes, “political thinkers have ended up reifying culture instead…and have inserted culture into the spot individual once occupied.&nbsp; Individual become culture-bearers, and thus rights (possessed by individuals) become obligations (extended to groups.)” It’s not clear to Menand why this is better, as he notes “[g]roup allegiance is not a sentiment with a terribly attractive history.” (80)&nbsp; Second, and more to the point, culture is unstable in modern societies.&nbsp; I love Menand’s quote here:</p>
<p>“Modern culture is not like a mosaic; it’s more like a Rubik’s Cube.&nbsp; The only thing prescriptive to be said about it is that the greater the number of people who have access to it, the greater the number of interesting and unpredicted combinations it will be possible to produce.&nbsp; But we are never likely to get anything like a generalizable pattern; for putting several items together in one place always involves rearranging the items everywhere else.” (80)</p>
<p>A very good image! for a point already made everywhere about the complexity and instability of culture.&nbsp;</p>

The Radicalism of the American Revolution,"<p>B Part I -- Monarchy</p>
<p>1. Hierarchy</p>
<p>Idea here is that to understand ""the extent of the change that took place in the Revolution"" Wood will have to describe ""the old colonial society that was subsequently transformed."" (11)</p>
<p>* Colonial society, W says, despite all the 17th century transformation was still ""traditional in its basic social relationships and in its cultural consciousness."" (11)  This meant that the household, society, and the state--private and public spheres--scarcely seemed separable."" (11)  So as a result ""authority and liberty flowed not as today from the political organization of society but from the structure of its personal relationships."" (11)</p>
<p>* Colonists still embraced notions of ""order and stability"" attached to ""monarchical society"".  (11)</p>
<p>* What did that mean?  Meant being a subject of the king.  And the ""allegiance the English subject owed his monarch was a personal and individual matter.  Diverse persons related to each other only through their common tie to the king, much as children became brotehrs and sisters only through their common parentage.""  As William Blackstone put it, the king was the ""<em>pater familias </em>of the nation.""  (11)  Wo,od says as this came to be understood theoretically by the colonists this implied ""a society of dependent beings, weak and inferior, without autonomy or indepedence, easily cowed by the pageantry and trappings of a patriarchal king.  The whole community, said Benjamin Franklin in 1763, is regulated by the example of the king."" (12)</p>
<p>* Yet the colonists as well as the English in general were in some ways not good monarchical subjects because of the way in the period following the Glorious Revolution of 1688, the English had ""becoming increasingly aware of the marvelous peculiarity of their limited monarchy...Representation in the House of Commons even allowed for the participation of His Majesty's subjects inthe affairs of government.  It was a constitution specially dedicated to liberty."" (13)  Wood downplays the difference between the colonies and the English back ""home"" in this respect--both thought of themselves and in some real ways were ""freer"" than the members of other European monarchies.  He describres on 14-15: working people in England might more freely emulate their betters in aw ay that in France was impossible.  Laboring men and women Wood says ""wore knee breeches and perukes, bonnets, and panniered dresses."" (15)  This couldn't happen in France e.g.  (15)</p>
<p>* Yet ""however superficial and hollow"" (15) Wood says, the colonists still lived in a ""monarchical society."" (15)  And he says that by the mid-18th century ""royal authority in the colonies was more deep-rooted and more effective by mid-century than ever before."" (17)  Trade operated within the ""British navigation laws"" despite smuggling.  There were also more succesful royal governors by mid-century: eg William Gooch and francis Fauquier in Virginia and Willim Shirely and Thomas Pownhall in Mass. (17)</p>
<p>* Religion, and especxially Anglican Church, tended to bolster allegiance to the king. (17-18)</p>
<p>* But royal authority was powerful at mid-century msotly because ""the theoretical underpinnings of [the colonists] social thought still remained largely monarchical."" (19)  Know Wood goes into a long an excellent description of the way in which the vision of ""social hierarchy"" in a monarchical soceity looked: 19-20.  Monarchy is a hierarchy that is acceptable because inequality is ""offset by the great emotional satisfactions of living in a society in which everyone, even the lowliest servant, counted for something."" (19)  This hierarchy constitutes a holistic order in which everyone had some purpose.  And Wood says in the 18th as much as in the 17th century it was still hard for the colonists ""to imagine a civilized society being anything but a hiearchy of some kind..."" (19)</p>
<p>* Much more good detail about how hierarchy was reinforced in the colonies as an experience, including eg Yale students needing to remove their hats at varying distances from superiors of various types.  (21)  See 20-23.</p>
<p>* Then also on 23, a long quote by Henry Fielding's cominc novel <em>Joseph Andrews</em> (1742) in which the social hiearchy is perceived as a ""kind of ladder."" (23)</p>
<p>II. Patricians and Plebians</p>
<p>* There was Wood says one great ""horizontal division"" in this hierarchy: ""that between extraordinary and ordinary people, gentlemetn and commoners."" (24)  This division maintained even in the 18th century despite things becoming more muddled.  ""There were the few who were sometimes called 'the reverend' or 'right reverend,' the honourable,' or ""excellent,' or 'noble,' or 'puissant,' or 'royal,' and ther ewere the many who were often called 'the Mob,' 'the Vulgar,' or culture, even the one betwe'the Herd.'"" (25)  Wood says this social division ""overwhelmed all others in the culture, even the one between free and enslaved..."" (25)</p>
<p>* In the English-speaking world, Wood says, 5% of popuation was part of aristocracy.  In colonies, slightly higher: 10%. (25)</p>
<p>* ""Aristocracy""--which earlier had referred to a particular form of gov't--in 18th meant popularly the ""entire patrician order"" (25): ""At its top was the king.  Below him were the peers of the realm, rarely numbering more than two hundred at any one moment in the eighteenth century.  These dukes, mrquesses, earlys, viscounts, and barons had huge estates and hereditary titles, and in the case of the English peersat least, autonomatically sat int he House of Lords...Baronetcies, too, were inheritable but gave the older no right to a seat in the House of Lords.  Below these were several titled ranks of knights and esquires.  The entire aristocracy was bottomed on the large body of gentry, the lowest social rank entitled to bear a coat of arms."" (25)</p>
<p>* A key identity was that of ""gentlemen.""  The term even applied to the king.  He describes the term on 28-30.  Their views on the ""common people"" on 27.</p>
<p>* What made the English aristocracy more open was that the legal access to the category of gentlementw as less controlled in eighteenth century.  (26)</p>
<p>* The common people, however, largely accepted their position, were even proud. And Wood notes that to understand the ""distinctiveness of the premodern world"" it is necessary to realize this acceptance of their position.  Then the radical chagnes in the ""consciousness of humility"" that the Am. Revolution caused can be appreciated. (30)</p>
<p>* In the colonies, the only aristocracy that the colonists would have known was the ""gentry.""  Tehy rarely saw anyone with a title.  (30)  But Wood thinks this didnt' make ""their aristocracy any less distinctive in their minds."" (30)</p>
<p>III. Patriarchal Dependence</p>
<p>* Most relationships in this hierarchical society were ""paternalistic.""  (43) The model was the family; it was the ""'measure of that Obediance which we owe to those whom Providence hath placed over us.'""  (43)  Thus: ""The language of paternalism and filial obligation still provided the common metaphors eighteenth-century Englishmen on both sides of the Atlantic used to describe their hierarchical experiences."" (43)</p>
<p>* Colonial society in particular was organized around the family.  The original Puritan settlers had referred to the family as a ""little Commonwealth.""  (44)  And the family was not just those living under one roof, but all those depenence on the patriarch who was the only person to deal with the ""larger world."" (44)  A Clergyman in 1754 that W quotes could then imagine that the Civil State was ""'furnish'd with Members from private Families...."" (44)</p>
<p>* 44-48, Wood gives details about the way certain families were organized in the various colonies, the names of those families, and also the way land, which was the basis of their power was passed through the same principles used in the home country: primogeniture and entail...</p>
<p>* Family also the basis of all politics and business.  Wood notes that the colonists often used ""family names--the De Lanceys in New York, the Ogdens in New Jersey, the Wentworths in New Hampshire--to designate political groups."" (48) This because positions of power handed down through these tightly-knit families of the landed gentry.  Great continuity: e.g. in teh half century before the Revolution in NJ, 70% of the reps elected to NJ assembly were realted to previously elected legislators.  (48)</p>
<p>* From here, Wood goes into a discussion of legal unfreedom.  The implication of paternalism is that those under the patriarch--both women and children--were not free--a principle rooted in Filmer's ideas (48-50).  This meant also that many young men who had yet to acquire land--esp as land became scarcer--were unfree (50).  Then there was the practice of black slavery (51).  And then Wood points out that in fact many whites, usually young men and women, were not free either due to the practice of indentured servitude.  (51)  Estimates were that 1/2 to 2/3 of all  immigrants to the oclonies came as indentured servants (51).</p>

The Quest for Jewish Assimilation in Modern Social Science,"<p>Notes 5/2013:</p>
<p>&gt; Based on the material on Boas in Ch. 5, his interpretation of Boas is unsurprising in its tendency to see Boas as basically operating within a kind of Herderidan-Humboldtian tradition of hermeticaly sealed cultural groups. E.g. he says on 104: ""Boas's cultural anthropology relates to anthropological groups; Simmel's relates to social forms as consisting of individuals."" (104) I really like what he sees in Simmel in Ch.5 (which is all I have read as of yet). But what he sees in Simmel there is much like what I'm trying to find in Boas... a vision of culture built on fragments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>### Ch.5 The Aesthetics of Jewish Assimilation</p>
<p>* This chapter is basically from a certain point of view examinign the particular contents of Simmel's individuallism. M-R notes on 86 that indvidiualism often has its own history and is understanding in specific ways.</p>
<p>* Key for Simmel's individualism is the notion of form. What is form for Simmel? Form was already in Germany a key word. ""it was at the same time both a generic philosophcial term and one deeply charged with political-ideological meanings, danding for everyt that is essential: state, church, people, culutre, society, law, or life itself."" (86) For Hegel, the state was this higher form. Goethe talked about ""INNER FORM."" Weber and Simmel take a ""formal"" approach to form, one that he notes is closedly tied iup with a notion of disenchantment. (87) For Simmel, there is always a ""fundamental discord between content and ofrm."" That discord is in turn the ""driving force of individuation."" Simmels' sociology, M-R, says is about showing how ""a contingent interest (content) becomes petrified in a (social) form."" (87) That is social form alaqyas exists ""autonomously from the interest that brought it into being."" (87) Here Simmel's notion of form is like Marx's second nature, but unlike Marx who thought this state of alienation vv such forms could be overhwlemed, Simmel treats it as a permanent human condition, such that ""individuation"" is a fundamental part of life and funamentally nonharmonioous. (87)</p>
<p>* Simmel is unlike Durkheim in that Durkheim deals with collectivies and not forms. He thinks that the collective is built up out of individuals and yet individuals also find their salvation in collectivities. For Simmel that is not the case. Taht is, Durkheim has a kind of ""ontological individualism"" in which only inidividuals exists (and are teh basis of collectivities). Simmel's is a methodological individualism -- where all must be ""explained in terms of individuals"" -- plus ontological indivdualism. (87-89) For Simmel individuals get ""entangled in existing forms..."" (89)</p>
<p>* A bunch of good stuff about Simmel's relationship to Marx and hsi use of the idea of divisino of labor. Simmel kind of universalizes the notion of division of labor? Because it is for him not just about labor but as Durkheim himself noted about the ""process of individuation in general."" (91) Divison of labor is just a subcase of that general pulse. (91)</p>
<p>* Here is where M-R's argument gets really good. in a section ""Simmel As Anti-German"". In the first part, ""From Whole to Fragments"": From Louis Dumont's German Ideology, M-R takes German Ideolgoy to be ""community holism + self-cultivating indivualism."" (92)&nbsp; His idea is that Simmel ""systematically destabilizes"" Bildung and Kultur. (92)</p>
<p>* He sets Simmel as operating within and against a Romantic tradition for whom Karl Philip Moritz was central, an aesthetics of totality. (93) The idea is that somehow in the contemplation of a work of art one is taken to something bigger than oneself. That is what the beautiful indicates. So that the concept of beauty isl linked to subordination. (93) But a certain kind of subordiation that unlike the subordation to an external god, is internal in nature. (93)</p>
<p>* But Simmel he said denies that society was an ""absolute entity."" (93) He iddi this by ""insisting uon the supremacy of the itnerconnecting parts."" [Think already of the supplanting of focus on form rather than colectivities... ] Society is not the a whole of hwoles.; yet in his ""Sociological Aeshetics"" it is definitely an aesthetic object. What Simmel's focuson the interconnecting parts does is also treat this aesthetic object in terms of assymetry and this M-R thinks is part of a ""conscious confrontation with traditional definition of beauty as forder, symmetry, and definiteness."" (94) M-R Notes that the likes of Ratzel and Voltaire saw Jews as aesthetically defiicient in terms of the calssic aesthetic qualiteis; i.e. ""taste, delicacy, p[roportion."" (94) As such, what Simmel does might even be called ""jewish aeshthetics."" He describes a progression from an acceptance of meaningless, to a will to symmetry, to a return to the irregular and assymetrical. (94) M-R writes of Simmel:</p>
<p>&gt; ""Simmel's imagery and concepts thus tie together aesthetics, society, and moderniusm through his unqiue notion of the individual. From whole to part, from totality to fragment, from hierarchy to web, from harmonious to disharmonious, from the part's subservience to the whole an aesehtic salvation in it, to no subservicence -- and no salvation."" (94)</p>
<p>* And: ""Simmel insists on society in terms of fragments that can only aggregate together but do not constite a whole."" (94)&nbsp;</p>
<p>* All this empahsis on fragemnts goes against what Dumont has called the German Ideology with its emphasis on the whole. It goes against Goethe's motto: ""Always aspire ot the whole: if you yourself cannot become a whole, fasten yourself to one, as a limb to its service."" (quoted o 94).&nbsp;</p>
<p>* So Simmel is subverting this deeply felt Romantic urge. He's undermining the German emphasis on thewhole, the Lutheran desire for salvation. (94)&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt; Note: Of course, M-R uses this formulation of German Ideology, but shoudl he???</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Pushing further now in a section ""Simmel against Bildung."" Tehre's a strong link between Jews and Bildung, see f.n,. #70. What Simmel has to say about Bildung is thus refering to Jews' attmepts to use it as a basis for asssimilation M-R thinks. Basically, what M-R thinks Simmel is doing is to try to use Bildung and Kultur in a way that returns them to ""their origin in Kant, as an unreliazable potential rather than as an accomlished realty."" (95) This the goes against in particular Hegel's use of Bildung as a ""complete realizable process."" (95)</p>
<p>* Dumon apparently has said that for Kant Bidlung was a ""ssort of horizon of thought, a regulative ideal that three of Kant's most distinguished successors turned into a realizable goal."" (95)</p>
<p>* Simmel by contrast affirms that ""individuailty is not a restriction of the infinite but its expression and mirror."" (This is either Dumont or Simell, quoted on 95.) M-R addsd ""Self-cultivation is by necessity an incomplete process."" (95) In f.n. 75 he refers to Dumon p.81, Simmel's ""The Individual Law"" and his treatment of it in an essay ""From Autonomous Subject to Free Individual in Semmel and Lacan,"" Journal of the History of European Ideas, 31 2005 (1) , 103-127.</p>
<p>* Going further he explains Simmel as a modification of Kant's notion of freedom, minus the empahsis on universality. So.</p>
<p>a. Kant</p>
<p>Kant made freedom core to his ethics, and his concept of freedom secured individuality: ""He defined freedom negatively as the [individual's] independence from the sensible owrld and positively as the obedience of the will ot the moral laws of practical reason."" (95) Thus reason is a universal principle that ""bridges individuality and universality,"" allowing man to ""project himself into a universal order."" That is why obedience to moral law = freedom. (96)</p>
<p>b. Simmel</p>
<p>In ""The Individual Law,"" Simmel rejects the universality in all of this, in an attempt to save the ""Kantian-Fichtian (modern) subject."" (96) He sees Kant and Fichte as dealing with&nbsp; a ""purely moral commuinity"" or <em></em>*Eins* . , i.e. a ""universally sycnretized subject"" -- in M-R's phrasing. But then he opposites this by 1) saying that the human being is a ""differntiating creature"" (*Unterschiedeswesen*)"" (96) and 2) by saying that Kant and Fichte see a sick society as one fragmented, and a healthy one as universal. He wants to reverse this, health is the fully individual condition. (96)</p>
<p>* Vv Bildung as salvation, which M-R thinks is linkned into the ""Christian symbolism"" underlying Bildung -- but is that all really there? -- that what Simmel is doing is denying that Biludng can bring salvation; to be more precise, he is saying that Bildung brings individuation, but not redemption/salvation, no deep peace of mind.

'Everyone, especially those who lead the drab life of the modern toiler, needs and craves an occasional 'good time,' he acknowledged.

The Victorian Connection,"p. 88-   Victorian Connection, Liberalism, and Problems of Democracy and Authority

Mill's idea was that human minds could ""distingusih truth from falsehood."" ""Hence the imperative of free inquiry, of speculation and argument without restraint, for free inquiry would ensure that reform eventually occured, that man would gain emancipation form all false and restrictive systems, whether moral or social.""  (88)  Hence the frustration with orthodox religion and the hierarchy of the Church of England.  (88)  

To this fear of hiearchy and orthodox belief, was added the fear of democracy and the masses which Mill got from reading Toqueville when he waas ""startled by the revelaiton of the possiblity of a tyranny more efficeint than that of any despot."" (Mill's words, quoted on 88-89).  Hall argues that the antidote that Mill conceived to this was ""a political system in which power rested with the 'few' who were trained to use their minds  and had the courage to stand apart form the masses.  A democrat in principle, Mill spke incrasingly after 1840 in favor of elitist rule."" (89)  

These same concerns were held, Hall says, by other Victorians in Britain and the U.S.  ""These lines of cultural criicsim converged upon th Victorians who came of age in the 1850's -- Arnold and Ruskin in England, Olmsted nad Norton in America."" (89)  See quotes by Olmsted and Norton on 89-90.  Note it might e worth reading Thomas Wentworth Higginson's essay ""A Plea for Culture"" (90)

On this basis, their suggest for reform were as follows; ""Mill urged proporational representation as the cure for the loss of independence and individuality.  Such a scheme, he believed, would permit uuniversal suffrage but in a way that ensured expression of every point of view.  Other suggestions included imposition of an educational qualification for the franchise, limits on the amount of money a candidate for coffice could spend on an election, and replacement of political patronage with a system of competitive examinations fr filling state offices.  On both sides of the Atlantic, civil service reform became a major demand of the liberals, merrging with their general interest in placing public administration upoon a scientific basis."" (90) 

Hall makes the point however that although Victorian liberals emphasized publi service and saw themselves as the educators of the public, they also did not rely on working throuhg public instituitons. ""to say that the Victorian connection believed in public services does not mean, however, that its members proposed to work through the state or its institutions.  According to Mill and Arnold, moral and social force sprang from truth, and truth could never fully coincide with or e embodied in any institution.  Only by teaching truth directly would the reformer succeed....Hence these intellectuals kept their distance from all political parties and the state.  Not unlike the Puritan ministry, they assumed that the act of sincere speech or writing would secure them the authority needed to accomplish their agenda of reform."" (91)   I.e. their intellectual authority would spring from truth and not from their instituitonal status...from their ability to discern truth from falsehood that is... thus intellectual authority for them was tied to this idea of subjectivity that the self oculd in fact distinguish truth from falsehood, as well as their special ability to do this as opposed to the masses."
Multiculturalism without Culture,"p. 8 - 9 Her critique of culture

""In developing this argument, I query what I see as one of the biggest problems with culture: the tendency to represent individuals from minority or non-Western groups as driven by their culture and compelled by cultural dictates to behave in particular ways. Culture is now widely employed in a discourse that denies human agency, defining individuals through their culture, and treating culture as the explanation for virtually everything they say or do. This sometimes features as part of the case formulticultural policies or concessions, but it more commonly appears in punitive policies designed to stamp out what have been deemed inappropriate or unacceptable practices. When, for example, European governments decide that the best way to protect young Moroccan, Turkish, or Bangladeshi women from being forced into unwanted marriages with strangers from their parents’ country of origin is to ban marriages with overseas partners for anyone under the age of eighteen, twenty-one, or twenty-four, they represent young women from these groups as incapable of agency. They operate on the (highly stereotypical) assumption that all parents from these cultural groups are coercive and all young women are submissive, and hence, that any marriage arranged with an overseas partner should be regarded as forced. I argue that a more careful understanding of culture provides a better basis for multicultural policy than the overly homogenised version that currently figures in the arguments of supporters and critics alike. A defensible multiculturalism will put human agency much more at its centre; it will dispense with strong notions of culture."""

Sincerity and Authenticity,"<p>Some Notes:</p>
<p>COMMENT: On Trilling's Use of Culture  It is sometimes more  ethnological, as in cultural difference: p. 1-2, where it is set against  the sense that there is something universal about humans.  Sometimes it  is Arnold's high culture, as in when it is a thing which advocates  those ideas which ""authenticity"" tended to de-legitimize (12).  It is  also normative social structures associated perhaps with the 19th  century, as in when authenticity involves moving down through a  ""cultural superstructures"" toward the heart... (13)</p>
<p>p.003-6 Basic Def'n Sincerity  Sincerity he suggests may represent a new  dimension of the conception of the self in Europe, which has however  been important for 400 years.    He writes: ""...I propose the idea that  at a certain point in its history the moral life of Europe added to  itself a new element, the state or quality of the self which we call  sincerity."" (4)  What is Sincerity?  Briefly: ""...a congruence between  avowal and actual feeling."" (4)  He defines it futher first with  Shakespeare's Hamlet (4-5) and then Matthew Arnold's discussion of the  difficulty of finding the true self:  Below the surface-stream, shallow  and light Of what we <em>say</em> we feel--below the stream Aslight, of what we <em>think</em> we feel--there flows With noiseless current strong, obscure and deep,  The central stream of what we feel indeed (quoted on 6, from?)  Then  brings up Freud who he said some 30 years later ""took the first steps  twoard devising a laborious discipline of research to discover where it  might be found."" (7)  So then the more robust def'n of sincerity is:  ""..the avoidance of being false to any man through being true to one's  own self..."" (7) And this is something that takes work to achieve...</p>
<p>p.006-12 Decline of Sincerity; Rise of Authenticity  He talks now about how sincerity lost its positive importance.  Modern  artists conceived of themselves not as ""selves"" but as ""personas"" --  they deined personality -- and this created awarness of ""roles""  --  which he connects to an emphasis that one has no choise to play roles,  see f.ln. 1 on p.11 -- and then below all those ""roles"", ""authentic""  self: ""In shoft, we paly the role of bieng ourselves, we sincerely act  the part of the sincere person, with the result that a judgement may be  passed upon our sincerity that is not authentic."" (12)  So authenticity comes to mind.  He says  And he describes it this way:  ""...I think that for the present I can rely on its [authenticity]  suggesting a more strenuous moral experience than 'sincerity' does, a  more exigent conception of the self and of what being true to it  consists in, a wider reference to the universe and man's place in it,  and a less acceptant and genial view of the social circumstances of  life.  At the behest of the criterion of authenticity, much that was  once thought o make up the very fabric of culture has come to seem of  little account, mere fantasy or ritual, or downright falsification.   Conversely, much that culture traditionally condemned and sought to  exclude is sought accorded a considerable moral authority by reason of  the authenticity claimed for it, for example, disorder, violence,  unreason."" (13)  And after quoting Yeats regards the need to get to the  ""foul rag-and-bone shope of the heart,"" (13) : authencity ""implies the  downard movement through all the cultural superstructures to some place  were all movement ends..."" (13)  All this implied a very different idea of how to be, than had sincerity.</p>
<p>p.013 - 25  Sincerity as a Way of Being and the Individual  Here is a history which I have just skimmed regarding the notion of  sincerity, and its connection to the demarcation of the notion of the  ""individual.""  And a def'n of what this individual is.</p>

Conventional Iconoclasm: The Cultural Work of the Nietzsche Image in Twentieth-Century America,"<p>00 Summary Note 00</p>
<p>Ratner-Rosenhagen's goal here is to analyze popular concetions of Nietzsche and his thought in the United States in the twentieth-century.  In a brief thoeretical discussion at the start of the article, she tries to add to ""reception history"" (which she likes because of the way it shifted attention away from texts to what people ""do"" with them 733) by suggesting that one needs also to look at the way people viewed the authors of those texts.  So in the article she spends much more time looking at the way people in the United States evaluated Nietzsche in relation to fairly conventional and shorthand assesments of his ideas.  Americans' interst in Nietzsche she argues was related to ""what historians have identified as the modern quest for authenticity"" (736)  She draws on Lears' ironic thesis about anti-modernism--that the antimodern impulse drove Americans to accept a therapeutic ethos of individualism--to argue that ""Nietzsche' authentic experience over the course of the century helped ease accomodation to the very liberal, secular, materialistic culture that they took as their enemy."" (736) Lears, she notes in f.n. #13, drew his language of ""weightlessness"" tc from Nietzsche in part.  Other American readers, she noted, simply ""transformed his nuanced vision of expressive individuality into a conventional celebration of atomistic individalism in the Americna liberal tradition."" (736)--that despite the fact that Nietzsche had challenged the idea of an undivided self.  (737)  It's the second sectin of the paper where she really goes into the different analyses of Nietzsche's ""image""--someting she notes fascinated Americans more than his writings.  Those concerned with cultural philistinism loved Nietzsche's Ubermensch--e.g. Mencken &amp; Brooks 739-740. The appeal of the Ubermensch had fallen away by 1941, though.  HIstorian Crane Brinton in a 1941 study pilloried Nietzsche and tried to link him to Nazism, and perceived Nietzsche's ""disdain for conventional life"" as ""pathological, not heroic."" (742).  The causes: he had been ""doted on by the 'women folk'"" (742); he had not played sports.  She describes a whole series of examinations of his character/biography both by admirers and critics (743-5)  A great section in an analysis by Will Durant esp. labels the source of Nietzsche's problems in his ""feminine fragility"" (748-9).  Others liked the way Nietzsche had emerged his life experience and philosphy (749-750).  Still others found in his work a redemptive sourge and energy (750-51).</p>
<p>I like her analysis, but I am inclined to ask, so what?  The article simply confirms basic stereotypes about Americans' anti-intellectualism. It reveals a series of variations on the way in whiche Nietzsche's ideas were received and his image constructed, but what is revealed is all somehow what you might expect--though it is good to have it documented.  But in the end her conclusion seems rather pedestrian.  She ends the essay pointing out the obvious: ""By exploring the idea of Nietzsche without sufficiently examining his ideas, many Americans simultaneously created and reconciled themelves to the very hostility to independent thought that they worried characterized American modernity."" (754)  So she begins trying to break out of the elitist mode of intellectual history by examining reception and perception of Nietzsche himself by the general public, but then she criticizes that non-intellectual public for being non-intellectual.  That doesn't seem fair; if she's going to take them seriously she should take them seriously.  The article seems unfocused.</p>"

AHR Roundtable: Historians &  Biography: Introdution,"<p>p.577 Methodological appeal of Biography</p>
<p>Nasaw sugests that biographay may become ""a favored one for twenty-first-century historians because it offers a way of transcending the theoretical divide between empiricist social history and linguistic-turn cultural history without sacrificing methodological or epistemological gains of either.""  (577)</p>
<p>He then brings up a comment by Spiegel in a commentary on Geoff Eley's <em>A Crooked Line</em> where she suggests an attempt to move  beyond the cultural (liguistic) turn has found many ""historians deploying a (largely implicit) concept of 'social phenomenology' in which, as the German sociologist Andreas Reckwitz explains, 'The aim of social analysis is to take over the ""subjective perspective.""'"" (quoted on 577)</p>
<p>This is ""neo-phenomenology"" that stives for what Spiegel calls an ""actore-centered perspective"" which in consistent with the idea in Kessler-Harris' contribution ""Why Biography?"" in this roundtable, i.e. a focus on the agent's own understanding of the situation where in that perception ""is mediated and perhaps constrained but <em>not</em> wholly controlled by the cultural scaffoldig of conceptual schemes within which it takes place."" (quoted on 577, see kessler-Harris, p.412 in this issue).</p>
<p>But Nasaw points out most of those focusing on this actor-centered perspective also stop short of grantin gactors autonomy.  Historains also look  beyond the perspective of their actors to thigs that their actors may not have known or seen.  Interstingly, Nasaw find confirmation of this in statements by the Marxist E.P. Thompson, and then Marx himself, see 577-578.</p>"
"The German Idea Of Militarism : Radical and Socialist Critics, 1866-1914.","<p>p.006-7 Categories &amp; Description of Def'ns of Militarism</p>
<p>Four types of militarism: pacifist, liberal, Marxist, and realist.  First three predicted a world without wra.  Realists did not. Definitions on p. 6 (see old hand-written notes).</p>
<p>In liberal version, Spencer equated industrial society with the forces of peace and progress and set up dichotomy between ""military"" and ""industrial"" societies.</p>
<p>That sociological approach merged with Marxist thought afte rdeath of Marx and Engels.  But the Marxists postponed the coming of age of peace to the period after the decline of industiral capitalism.</p>
<p>All of these programs have failed and that would seem to provide much support for the realist position.  ""But by reducing war to a matter of political expediency realists also leave out of the equation precisely the questions of subordination and violence which transform human beings into blind instruments and which ever since Kant spoke aobut the 'Kingdom of ends', of treating all human beings as ends in themselves, have been so central to the debate."" (7)</p>
<p>pp. 7-10, Stargardt goes into detail showing the connections and overlaps between the four understandings of militarism.  My interest now is in the liberal.  What sets it apart he says is its focus on the domestic space, on the problem of protecting civil society from the state and the military.  That line of thought goes back to civic republicanism in Italy and winds it way into English, Dutch, French and German englightenments and then to socialist writers.  See p.10, top.</p>
<p>But Star. notes that a less radical form of liberal antimilitarism emered after the state-building efforts of the late 19th century and the disillusionment of WWI.  ""In this verison it mattered relatively little whether the army was a permanent professional or a part-time citizen force so long as it oculd e held responsible to a civilian government and respected the independence of civil society."" (10)  This he says was the position of the ""Young"" liberals during the constitutional conflict between Bismarck and the Prussian Chamber.  And under this point of view as well ""the balance between military and civil authority becomes an issue of jurisdiction, legal norms and sanctions.""

American Moderns: Bohemian New York and the Creation of a New Century,"p.249 - 251 Description of Creative Partnerships

Important part of sexual modernism were what Stansell refers to as the ideal of ""...playful, inventive partnerships.""  (249)  On 226 this: ""...transcendent friendships unimaginable to earlier generations"", the 'true companionship and oneness' of men and women that Emma Goldman preached in her lectures on love."" (226)


This she describes as the invention of ""heterosexuality"" in the 20th century.  New emphasis on the importance of heterosexuality.  Homosexuality only ""eliptically allowed."" (251)  

Also! Professionalism is a key part of creative partnerships.  These are creative partnerships between professionals.  Stansell refers to these as ""the proliferation of professional relationships."" (250).   Also see her desc. of Reed & Bryan's relationship 252-258: professional tensions between men and women, the varying opportunities for women, the authrotiy of men, and professional jealousy are all part of this.  

Such partnerships reveal partnerships also to be of ambivalent nature; they are also the way for women to get access to the professions.  Cf. Stansell's comments on the base of Reed and Bryant's relationship (252-253); Bryant's failure to get to Paris during WWI b/c women barred from rront lines by French, and only Inez Haynes who was Bryant's nemesis get's there by going with her hsuband Will Irwin.

"The Decline of the German Mandarins:  The German Academic Community, 1890-1933","<p>p.090-097 Description of Tradition of German Idealism</p>
<p>Ringer describes 1 of the 2 theories that he thinks were the most imporrant ""formal elements in the mandarins' scholarly heritage"": Idealism and the German historical tradition.</p>
<p>Idealism, rooted in Kantian criticsm, struck at ""common sense"" view of experience.  Common sense point of view describdedin one paragraph on p.91, sees the ""things"" in the world as real objects imprinted upon our sensory system.  The things we senses are thus part of a ""natural order of objects and movements."" (91)</p>
<p>Kantian criticsim goes against this.  Based o na problem: how do we know that the objects we sense are related to actual external objects?  Thsi is a logical problem, not necessarily a question of fact or metaphysics.    We have no direct experence of the object, just different ""sensations"" at different times that we gropu around ""constructed references: objects."" (91) So a series of quesitons arise: ""How can we do that?  What accounts fo the apparent cohernece and objectivity of our experience?  Where do we get our sense of time and space, without which we could not organize our perceptions?""  (91)  The answer to this logical problem is that it is ""logically impossible to treat our perceptions as ordinary effects of external reality.""  (92)  Ther eis an ""unbridgeable gap between experience and the thing itself."" (92)  Ernst Cassirer calls this the ""probelm of terminism.""  This does not mean that you should not coduct empirical investigaiton but you must, if you will be a Kantian, acknowldege th efollowing: ""First, we must admit that certain a prior elements, certain categories of a logical character, must necessarily be presnet in our experience, giving it its organized objective quality.  Secondly, we must resist the temptation to equate our ideas with things, and relationships between ideas with relationships betwen objects.  In short, we must not fall back into the common-sense views..."" (92)</p>
<p>So this means that the German mandarins were well-armed against ""the implicit metaphysics of certain nineteenth-century scientisms."" (92)  There was he says a ""generalized suspicion of the common-sensefallacy"" that led many German mandarins to distrust empirical research. (92)  The Kantian critique tended to turn the process of verification toward a technique that focused on an ""internal"" operation rather than an examinaiton of the ""external"" world.</p>
<p>But there is also another ""tendency"" in idealism that Ringer describes: the tendency for the tradition to posit ""an absolute Ego or universal spirit."" (93) This came about as the mandarins ""continued to work with some analogue of thd iscarded comparison between thought and thing,"" without every going os far as to describe reality as an ""illusion or a well-made dream."" (93)  In an attempt to preserve a correspondence between our thoght and reality, some postualted an ""abstract mind or spirit."" (93)  ""the Kantian categories and all the norms of right thinking which insure the order and certainty of our expeirence cannot be regarded as empirical, psychological properties of this or tht individual mind.  They are necessary axioms of all knowledge, and it is therefore tempting to atribute them to something like a transcendental consciousness.""  (93)  This transcendental coscoiusness Ringers says was a ""purely logical construct"", but could aquire a ""quasi-religious"" meaning."" (93)  And he notes that German Pietism and philosphical Protestantism could underwrite that sort of interpretation.  That dimension could be further enhanced by the fact tat the mandarins intended for their Idealism to be absorbable by nonpprofessionals.  Some described it as a worldview with its roots in Plato and which had a practical-ethical component, an emphasis on the ocnsciousness and its ""freedom and action"" (see Windelband quote on 94)  (93-94)  This sense of a transcendental onsicousness also evident in the German word <em>Geist</em> which stood for the ""collective thought of mankind and sometimes for a transcendental consciousness.</p>
<p>Idealism was particular powerful in humanisitc and historical studies...in the <em>Geistwissenschaften</em>...the german classificaiton of such disicplines that seemed to imply a Idealist pointr of view.  That prhase had atenecedents, that went all the way back to Mill or even Descartes, but whicn in Germany Weber had traed to Hermann von Hlemholtz, the German psycho-physicist of the mid-19th century.  Hegel also promoted its usage and Welhelm Dilthey gave it a clear definitionin the 1880s, describing what he called ""objective gesit"" as ""the whole rangeof man's past cultural achievements that are accessible to use in theform of literature, conventions of language, works of art, codes of law, and other documents or remnants of whatever kind."" (Ringer's words, 97)</p>"

(115) The good man is ""master of himself"" or kreitto autou.  Plato also sets up a higher and lower soul ""to logisikon"" v. ""to epithumetikon"".  ""The good sols enjoy order (kosmos), concord (xumphonia), and harmony (harmonia), where the baad are torn every which way by their desires and are in perpetual conflict.""

The Case for Contamination,"<p>General Notes 1/2012</p>
<p>This article is somehow an excerpt of Appiah's book on Cosmopolitanism.&nbsp; It seems to go about material located in the chapter on Contamination specifically,&nbsp; and it is somehow much sharper and easier to see what Appiah's arguments are.&nbsp; Appiah's point here is to attack the ideal of cultural preservation in particular as he saw it expressed in a convention on the ""protection and promotion"" of cultural diversity that was approved at the UNESCO General Conference in Oct 2005.&nbsp; He wants instead to suggest the importance of cultural contamination:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When people speak for an ideal of cultural purity, sustaining the authentic culture of the Asante or the American family farm, I find myself drawn to contamination as the&nbsp; name for a counterideal.&nbsp; Terence [an African slave named Publius Terentius Afer born in Carthatge taken to recome 2nd centruy B.c., he ha smentioned in paragrah before] had a notable firm grasp on the range of human variety: 'So many men, so many opinions' was one line of his.&nbsp; And it's in his comedy ""The Self-Tormentor that you'll find what may be the golden rule of cosmpolitanism - <em>Homo sum: humani nil a me alienum puto, </em>""I am human: nothing human is alien to me.""&nbsp; The context is illuminating.&nbsp; A busybody farmer named Chremes is told by his neighbor to mind his own affairs; the homo sum credo is Chreme's breezy rejoinder.&nbsp; It isn't meant to be an ordinance from on high; it's just the case for gossip.&nbsp; Then again, gossip - the fascination people have for the small doings of other people - has been a powerful forc for conversation among cultures. (section 6)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The impetus for the protection of cultures is in part driven by a concern for homogenization and ""cultural imperialism"", but in Appiah's case cosmopolitanism does not imply homogenization.&nbsp; Here he has contrasted cosmopolitans with jihadists who he sees as ""counter-cosmopolitan"" universalists and absolutists.&nbsp; What contrasts them from cosmopolitanisms is not that they believe in universal truth, for cosmopolitans believe in that too, but their appraoch to truth and tolerance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To say what, in principle, distinguishes the cosmpolitan from competing univeralisms, we plainly need to go beyond talk of truth and tolerance.&nbsp; One distinctively cosmpolitan commitment is to pluralism.&nbsp; Cosmpolitans think that there are many values worth living by and that you cannot live by all of them.&nbsp; So we hope and expect that different people and different societies will embody different values.&nbsp; Another aspect of cosmopolitanism is what philosophers call fallibilism -- the sense that our knowledge is imperfect, provisional, subject to revision in the face of new evidence. (section 4)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He heads off the criticism that ""liberal pluralists"" (same as cosmpolitan??) self-refute when they are ""intelerant of radical intolerance"" but for him that is a ""mistake"".&nbsp; On the one hand, he thinks that one can care about indivdual freedom while understanding that it will not always have the same ""contours"" everywhere.&nbsp; But the also wants simply to assert that individual freedom is not for everyone, ie the counter-cosmopolitans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He is willing to admit further that ""liberty and diversity may well be at odds"".&nbsp; He comes to this point after explaining how Muslims react hostily to Western mores governing men and women in public.&nbsp; But he think that here too cultural preservation is ""not&nbsp; helpful.""&nbsp; Here his point vis-a-vis cosmpotlianism deepends and also becomces more like what I want to say about Boas' cosmpmolitanism.&nbsp; What he calls ""living cultures"" do not ""evolve from purity into contamination""; the change was more ""gradual"" he says, or in fact he suggets they were always contaminated.&nbsp; It is a movement from ""one mixture to a new mixture,"" and this process take place away ""rules and rulers"" in ""the conversations that occur across cutural boundaries."" (section 5)&nbsp; His key point about these ""conversations""--indeed the word is a bit misleading--is that they are not mediated by appeals to reason.&nbsp; He gives an example of the way movements against the binding of women's feet took hold in Chian in the 1910s and 1920s.&nbsp; His poitn is that this other set of ideas ""took hold"".&nbsp; He writes: ""The appeal to reason can explain neither the custom nor its abolition.""&nbsp; In another example, he speaks of middle-class women going to work in the West.&nbsp; Here too reason had a smaller role than one would assume.&nbsp; Here he makes his poitn wrly: ""The arguments that kept the old pattern in place were not--to put it mildly--terribly good.&nbsp; If the reasons for the old sexist way of doing things had been the problem, the women's movement could have been done in a couple of weeks.""</p>
<p>It is this process of things taking hold that I suspect Boas gave some more meat too!!</p>

The World After the Russia-Georgia War,"(( Summarial Note ))

This article presents fairly clear the logic whereby one views the emergence of an emerging conflict not between the west and the rest, but between a series of world powers who refused to be ""assimilated"" into the existing  geo-political order: 

""Moreover, as Richard Sakwa observes, ""the international system today does not have a mechanism for integration of rising great powers"" - whose terms of integration have to be negotiated, not dictated from Washington or Brussels.""

This also implies a failure of the US to force get Russa to ""assimlate."": 

""Washington and its closest allies, having failed to integrate Russia by assimilating it - i.e. transforming it into a liberal-democratic market state that would follow the Washington consensus and join the America-led liberal world order - are now trying to contain Russia by expanding Nato to Georgia and Ukraine; planning to erect ballisitic-missile defences close to Russia's borders; and vying with Russia over the route of energy pipelines.""

Contrast this then in a textual way with Huntington's article on Clash of Civilizations.  The authors also mentions another article which argues against Huntington's clash of civilizations argument: a Rand report by Zalmay Khalizad & Iran Lesser, ""Sources of Conflict in 21st Century: REgional Futures and U.S. STrategy."""

Muncy makes intersting points here regards to interaction between gender and professionalization within the female dominion.  She notes that the Child Bureau could not reproduce settlement house's informal culture.  The lines of power and strucfcture were ""formally delineated.""  The women occupying certain positions were ambiitous.  Job market  and governemntal structure Muncy says modified female professional culture.  Also bureaucrati cprocedures that led Lathrop to enforce a code of conduct in May 1918 that woud limit personal conversation.  (54)  But Muncy notes ""that bureaucratic structure did not utterly control the working lives of women in the Children's Bureau; it acted as a tube through whh female professional culture was forced and thereby modified."" (55)  Professionalization she notes in fact made some settlement house traditions more efficient and notes the new use of advanced publicity tecniques (pamphlet's, press releases, radio spots, etc) to get out and popularize information about childbirth and childrearing.  Massive sales of pamphlet's written by Mary Mills West on prental care, infant care, etc... (see 55-56).

The Eskimo then decide at the behest of a shaman apparently that Boas not be allowed into their igloo. (36) Boas reaction was that this ""hostility"" ought not be ""allowed to prevail"". (36) this reaction is interesting. Clearly, it does involve a kind of arrogant reaction to what Boas could see still as superstitious belief, even though it probably was not. But there is also a more complex background here. One has to think of the fondness Boas had developed for the igloo, for the experience of entering them after being very cold. &nbsp;He says this in the letter from Jan. 22, on 36-37, where the point is in fact that his point of view has shifted in the way that Cole notes oin his editor note on p.21, ie this is the kind of shift in the appreciation of what is beautiful that I am getting at in my Mamifold article.&nbsp;</div>

Does he mean that he would be restricted to physics and teaching? for which he now says he has ""little inclination."" (37) But then he says that in the United States he can further the ""ideas for which I live."" but which ideas? Scientific ideas? Maybe but maybe not beau as a bit further along he says: ""What I want to live and die for, is equal rights for all, equal possibilities to learn and work for poor and rich alike! Don't you believe that to have done even the smallest bit for this, is more than all science together? I do not think I would be allowed to do this in Germany."" (37) So there is no reference here to his being blocked as a Jew. The clearest reference is to a restriction to his science, whatever that means. But perhaps it need not be said to Marie because she knows already, or on the other hand why would he not be free to reference the role of his Jewishness in is calculation with Marie? I need to look in Cole's biography because I think he has a reference from Boas to the Jewishness problem in this calculation....</div>

He refers romantically tomMarie and how she will help him and give him strength to do all this, an dthen he writes: ""But I must return to harsh reality! The activities of the Eskimo, the howling of e dogs, the screaming of the children, all in this small iglu , call me back."" obviously this is just a transition out of the letter, but the juxtapositions are interesting between a discussion of ideas, even ideals, and love for Marie, and then a reference to.

He has referred to the situation in the iglu, then he says he wonders what she is doing, and again the theme from before and discussion of new years activity on 34-35, the theme of her being among her people: ""At least you have the advantage of being able to speak with them [whatever company she is keeping].

History: Professional Scholarship in America,"p.015 Failure to bind patricians and academicians...

Higham describes it in terms of ""authority"": ""In the absence of a political system capable of binding the patrician intellectual and the academic teacher to a common center of authority, the two groups eventually drifted apart."" (15)  

Effects:
After 1890s # of amateur historians declines.  And he says: ""A similar disengagement evidently occured in other fields of cultural endeavor.  One thinks of Edith Wharton's literary isolation in upper-class New York, hder descriptions of delicate American dilettantes in Europe, and her own nostalgia."" (15)  Higham thinks that the ""aristocratic revival"" of a post-civil war period had dissipated by the end of the century and that in the ""increasingly demcoratic atmoosphere of theProgressive Era the aristocracy of culture very largely went to pieces; and many o fits patrician elements became--like Henry Adams himself in his late ryears--peevish, precious, and aloof.""

Getting Spliced: Modernism and Sexual Difference,"p.107-111 Mina Loy (and Stein) v Pound

Burke argues that whereas Pound's model of intellectual activity involved the ""poet-sculptor's forceful mental imprint upon matter, both Loy and Stein were more concerned with the physical properties of language as the 'belle matiere' itself."" (107)

But whereas Stein's vision of ""psychosexual and syntactic connections"" had been positive, Loy's was negative.  She had been experiencing difficult times.  So in contrast to Stein's G.M.P and Tender Buttons, Loy's 1915 Love songs ""embodies a disillusioned vision of psychosexual relations that reflects theri period of consumption, during the first year of the Great War."" (107)

Futurists had taught her that ""the poetic image was what the mind determined it to be: it had no fixed objective reality. It might or might not be mimetic or representational, and more likely than not, it resembled those unstable mental pictures being discussed by the new theory of psychoanalysis."" (108)  

The reality Loy conjured, unlike Pounds where the male mind imprinted on female matter, ""suggets, rather, a model more like a painterly verison of the Freudian unconscious, in which images and meanings lie dormant yet accessible to the artist through a creative process that is a kind of self-analysis."" (108)

In Aphorisms she called this ""mental spatiality."" (108)

She then analyzes some of Loy's ""Love Songs"" showing the way Loy's formal technique subjects the ""familiar images and language of romantic love"" to inspection and ultimately mocking and distancing herself from the prospect of male-female marriage or union.  (108-111)"
"Verging on Etra-Vagance: Anthropology, Hisotry, Religion, Literature, Arts...Showbiz","(5) p. 25-28 (Ch.1, Section ""Über Benedict"") 

Boon argues here that Benedict's book, to the reader, is built most strongly around the Appolonian/Dionysian dichotomy that she takes from Nietzsche.  For instance, he argues ""Neither Benedict's schemes of multiple variations nor her unfortunate diagnostic labels for Dobu and Kwakiutl dispel readers' fantasies that her shifting text--actually covering many sides of social organization and ritual practice--simply fleshes out a singular dualism, filched from a mad philosopher."" (29) 

The point he makes on the pages between 25-29 is that the reader's ""recollection"" of reading gives the impression of an integrity in her account of these ""cultures"" that is not actually there, and that the apparent integrity is actually only held together by the reader's awareness of Nietzsche's dichotomy.  

But his point is actually not then to proceed to a ""true"" account of things, but to inquire into the ""manifest strategies behind <i>Patterns of Culture</i> and to fragmentary ritual practices featured in Benedict's semi-thick descriptions."" (30)"
The Subject of Liberty: Toward a Feminist Theory of Freedom,"p.003-6 Negative Liberty Analysis

Negative and positive liberty are still the most important conceptual divisions of liberty...

She examines the notion of negative liberty through major theorists Berlin, Taylor (a critic).

Neg. lib.  defines liberty as absence of external barriers to ones desires. 

In that it supposes that desires must be conscious it ""draws clear-cut lines between inner and outer, subject and object, self and other."" (4)

So Taylor calls it ""tough-minded"" b/c of emphasis on indiv. responsiblity and ""choice"" and accepting consequences of choices. (4-5)

But one must not actually choose to pursue desires, rather one must have the opportunity to do so in order to be free.  (5)"
Autonomy in Moral and Political Philosophy (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy),"<p>Section 1.2 - Conceptual Variations</p>
<p>A theory of authonmoy is ""simply a construction of a concept aimed at captruing the gneeral sense of 'self-rule' or 'self-government'...""</p>
<p>Two componentss to self-rule: ""the independence of one' sdeliberation and choice from manipulaiton by others, and the capacity to rule onself.""  The second implies a discussion of the first and so is more primary.</p>
<p>Two further ""families of conditions"" in conceptions of autonomy often iscussed: competency conditions and authenticity conditions.  The former the ""capacity for rational thought, slef-control, and freedom form debilitating pathologies, systemiatic self-deception..""  The latter the ability to ""reflect upon and endorse (or identify with) one's desires, values and so on.""</p>
<p>The above conception is the basic definition and is influential, and then there are variations which she goes through...not going to talk abou thtem all.  But will mention some in my notes.</p>
<p>Impotant and most prominant objection is that the idea of ""identification"" with one' s own desires is problematic.  One can identity with oneself someting bad with out judging, i.e. simply acknowledging.  One could acknowledge something about oneself without approving of it.  Is that a state of autonomy?  This question creates a distinction between ""procedural independence"" and ""substantive independence,"" the latter would suggest that one cannot be considered autonomous in certain ""constrained life situations"" merely based on having made free and autonomous (procedurally independent) decisions to arrive at that state. Substnative independence ""threatens to rob the attribution of autonomy of any claim to value neturality...""</p>
<p>Another objection strikes at the idea that ""second-order"" reflection can be trusted as a model of verification even in cases in which it ""approves"" of first-order aspects of the self.  Such ""high level judgements"" may have no ""greater claim to <strong>authenticity </strong>than their first order cousins.""</p>
<p>A related critique is that the stress on higher level reflection/judgement implies a kind of hyper-intellectualism. ""Connections to values, deisres, and perosnal traits ore often gorunded in emotial and affective repsonses, ones connected with care, commitment and relations to other.""</p>

Antiromantic Romanticism: Sapir's Critique of American Individualism,"<p>p.091-95  Critique of efficiency/business Cult is in Anth thought</p>
<p>H now turns to look at how Sapir's critique of mass democracy, efficiency, and business culture influenced his anthropology thought.  He says the corollary was his ""personality-in-culture"" studies.  He raises once again Murray's quesoitn about Sapir: did he reify the individual.  Again H suggest that the answer is no: ""it is also possible to see Sapir as placing emphasis on the soul's making, as it were, its ongoing efforts to shape self-expression in its struggles with artistic media and techniques."" (91)</p>
<p>H refers back to previous material here noting that in his Dickinson review Sapir spoke of ""'the intuitive hunger of the soul for the beautiful moulding of experience actually felt,' of 'unhampered intuitive living'"" ( quotedon 91) And he brings up the ""Twilight of Rhyme"" piece the idea that the ""perfection of form is always essential"" and that every artist/cutlure ""must solve the prolem  [of form] ever anew"" (quoted on 91). H's point is that here Sapir is spekaing of an artist as an individuality but also is stessing ""the artist's experience transmuted into art thorugh an active and ongoing engagement of the individual creativity and traditoinal aesthetic forms."" (91)</p>
<p>Now he tries to connect this to Boas' and to romanticism.  Here he goes all wrong I think.  He cites Boas' reference to romantic ideal of ""indivdiuality"" and to Goethe in ""The Study of Geography"" (92); then he notes that the romantics were critical of the reductionism of what they saw as Enlightenment thought.  All this is true.  Then he intepretes Boas' attackson race as a critique of scientific abstraction cum reductionism. (92)  That's tenous... then he suggests that Sapir ""felt compelled"" to critique Kroeber's superorganic as a reducitonist abstraction.  (93) This is too simplistic I think; the connection is not such a straight line.  It is not that this point is wrong, but that it's not just romanticism.  The problem may come earlier i the essay, in the frame of antiromantic-romanticism and the way he explains it by rooting it in romanticism even thought he identifies it with Wyndham Lewis--a modernist!  The same problem is evident in his attempt to conflate Arnold with Bourne with Sapir...he's not sensitive to the differences even though yes they are moving in the same line... from romatnicism to modernism etc...</p>
<p>Where he takes this in terms of the individual as monad thogh is certainly right: that Sapir's view ofthe individual is probalby not that of the ""self-contained moad"" as Murray charges, but of ""individuals multiply defined,a s it were, in terms of their participation in a range of varying social relatoins."" (95)</p>
<p>I would just ask whether this is a description of the individual that actually satisfies Sapir.  It's this complicated description of the individual that is precisely what is so modern about SApir, because he builds it up on a complex psychological view of personality as a relational structure... but does this satisfy Sapir???</p>"

<p>Lears introduces it like this: ""As more and more people became enmeshed in the market's web of interdependence, liberal ideals of autonomous selfhood became ever more difficult to sustain."" (7) He continues: ""For entrepreneurs as well as wageworkers, financial rise or ruin came to depend on policies formulated far away, on situtations beyond the individual's control. And by the 1890s, as Alfred D. Chandler and host of economics historians have made clear, the large bureaucratically organized corporation was becoming the dominant model for businessmen who sought to organize the national market.  Jobs were becoming more specialized, more interdependent; personal autonomy was becoming more problematic.  Itwas not surprising that believers in self-made mahood grew uneasy. Even the privileged ones fretted over ""Our Lost Individuality"" as they pondered the coming of a mass society. 'We are aa mass,' an <em>Atlantic</em> writer complained in 1909.  'As a whole, we have lost the capicity for separate selfhood.'"" (8)  He then invokes Susman's theme of a turn toward personality as a shift from building ""character"" and mastering one's physical environment to poise, confidence, and charm.  Then he invokes Riseman and a turn toward ""masks"" and role playing:   ""As success became more dependent on evanescent 'impression managment' selfhood lost coherence.  The older ethic had required adherence to an internalized morality of self-control; repressive as this 'inner-directoin' had been, it helped to sustain a solid core of selfhood.  The newer ethic of ''other-direction' undermined the solidity by prsenitng the self as an empty vessel to be filled and refilled according to the expectations of others and the needs of the moment.  Afte rthe turn of the century, success manual sincreasingly prescribed wthat the sociologists David Riesman has called 'modes of manipulating the self in order to manipulate others.' The successfull man or woman had 'no clear core of self' (in Riesman's words0, only a set of social masks."" (8)   He then notes that this idea had been around but ther ehad before been the assumption of the ""existence of a 'simple, genuine self.'"" (8)  But now there was a turn toward imagining other kinds of selves that had no such character. He notes but does not detail the work of George Herbert Mead and William James as examples.   He quotes Howells; ""...the huma personality seemed like an onion which was 'nothing but hells, that you keep peeling off, one after another, till you think you have got down to the heart at last, and then you have got down to nothing.'""

Women in Early American Anthropology,"00 Summarial Note 00 

This article examines the experience of what the author defines as an ""
early"" generation of female anthropologists in the US.  By ""early"" she means women born prior to 1885.  Her case studies are: Erminnie Smith, Alice Fletcher, Matilda Stevenson, Zelia Nuttall, Frances Densmore, and Elsie Clews Parsons.

The overall tone of the article is positive, tracing an ever greater recognition of women's work in anthropology and an ever-increasing quality of their work.  She draws some general conclusions (the evidence for which did not seem to me to be fully in the body of the paper) on 78-81.  Main points are:

--That women did not confine themselves to data seemed appropriate to women, like children or something.  (78)  

-- She sees the disbanding of the Women's Anthropological Society in 1889 as a recognition of the universal significance of women's work.  [But would women have been stronger in the profession had they retained an organization?] (78)

-- But women in early years were present in the field b/c it was though that they could access data not available men.    Here she explains women conformed to traditional Victorian sex standards.  (78-9)

-- She notes also the persistence of gendered criticism by men of women in anthropology.  Women who did not conform to ninteenth-century norms were ""either 'bad women' or so intellectually gifted that, proverbial exceptoins to the rule, they were accorded respect and egalitarian treatment by men.  Women who succeeded were by definitino notable for their intelligence and unconventional aspirations, but in most cases these traits were not enough..."" (79)  Not enough for what???

-- All the women, she notes, ""had advantages of family welath, social status, and an interest in education that allowed them greater latitude of behavior than if their families had been ppoor and ignorant."" (79)"

American Moderns: Bohemian New York and the Creation of a New Century,"p. 270-272 Sexual Modernism & Troubled Masculinity

A sharp and concise discussion of men's lack of confidence and trouble with masculinity within what Stansell has called Sexual Modernism.  

-- Given that feminism and the New Woman -- whom the Bohemian men supported -- were seen within sexual modernism as the bearers of modernity, the men were unsure of their own significance.  Stansell notes that though the men supported the New Woman, they had grown up at a time ""in which the depleting effect of feminization the nation's cultural and intellectual life was taken as fact.""  (270) She notes then that they ""faced the question of how to be culturally potent at a moment when women seemed to be the bearers of change.""  (270)  She explains that in the 1890s bohemians had deployed the man-about-town image, with colonial traveler and western explorer swagger, but then in 1910s it became difficult: ""...its men were not always cast in a leading role in the theater of the new.  The stage belonged, above all, to the self-proclaimed heroines in the story of emancipation, the rebel girls, the Emma Goldman fans, the writers of racy vers libre, 'all of the girls [who] felt that they were young women o f genius condescending to enjoy life among this gypsy rabble.'"" (270-271)

-- One ""recourse was to idealize the manood of the proletariat."" (271) Wobblies seemed to possess a stable masculinity.  Max Eastmen, e.g., had disguised himself as a hobo after college and rode the rails.  Also the ""tramp"" --- She refers to this in Chaplin's The Tramp (1914). (271)

-- Another was ""homoerotic humanism"" a phrase coming from literary historian Paul Fussell on Wilfred Owen...this ""infused the generation of young men in Europe who went off to war."" (271)

-- Excellent quote from Floyd Dell in terms of the reversal men were experiencing her...she suggests that they became a ""docile interolocutor"" as women took the stage of ""the new"" as she calls it.  Floyd Dell recalled modelling for  aJackson Park sculptor: ""...'I shall never forget the sensation of sitting on a model and being stared at by a handsome sculptress.  A man is used to having a prolonged meeting of his eyes with a girls' mean something; and it is hard to get used to meeting a girl's wide-eyed, impersonal stare.' The habit of a masculine lifetime bridled at looking at a woman with sexual interest and receiving nothing in return.  'I became uneasy and almost afraid -- I wanted to look away , but that seemed cowardly and evasive.'"" (272)

But stansell hints that they will strike back."
The Professions and Social Structure,"00 Summary 00

This article presents an approach to understanding the significance of the professions in the structural-functionalist vein.  Prasons' ideas on the subject
were influential (though I don't have a good sense of how and why).  

Parsons analyzes the internal structural system of meaning and decision making within the professions, especially as it pertains to the question of whether or not professionals operate ""altruistically"" as opposed to businessmen who act ""acquisitively.""  Parsons conclusion is that this distinction is a false dichotomy both for businessmen and for professionals.  The argument in other words is that the more complex rendering of the relationship between individuals and institutions in terms of individual decision making that Parsons presents is also relevant for business, and thus that the study of the professions is also useful for understanding the ""occupational structure"" of modern society more generally.  (See pgs 465-467).


So then how  does Parsons understand this relationship between the individual an the institution in the professions?  This is really crux of his argument in general because even though he's saying that business institutions and professional institutions are not what we assume them 
to be (i.e. respectively selfish and altruistic), the model he evolves in 
describing the professional occupational structure is the model he would
also seek to apply to the business world.  

His model of professionals is as follows.  While they are not altruistic, he says, their motives are primarily unique in hi sdescription in that they are not defined by what he terms ""traditional""  means (his primary example being kinship bonds).  Firstly, he believes that they are defined instead by
a ""continual and subtle pressure to be rationally critical, particularly of ways and means."" (459)   Secondly, he presents the nature of intellectual authority as he sees it among professionals.  That authority he says is limited by ""specificity of function"".  That is, one only exercises authority in a 
specific ""'filed' of knowledge and skill."" (460) So this menas that also ""[c]ommerical relations in our  society are predominantly functionally specific, kinship relations, functionally diffuse."" (461) Another example, is
the ability of a certain professional to gain access to a private realm when 
functioning in a bureaucractic ""office"" but  not in his ""private"" capacity. (461).
Thirdly, professionals deal with people in abstract terms.  To the professional people are ""cases"" or ""clients"" or ""customers"" not ""total personalities."" (462)  [Simmel makes a similar point aobut modern society.]
Lastly, Parsons argues that professionalism emphasizes ""universalism"" and judges merit on these terms. (462-3)  Thus it is independent of status as it functions in kinship groups or what he refers to as ""primary group relationships."" (463)  Thus professional instituions seek independence from ""social structures where particularism is dominat..."" (463)  (462-3) 

Based on this analysis then he begins to blur the lines between acquisitiveness and altrusim in the professions first (463-465) and then
trying to suggest that thi smodel actually helps to characterize the whole
of modern society better than an acquisitive model of ""capitalism"" (466-7)."
Ruth Benedict and the Modernist Sensibility,"p.138 Contradiction of Modern Social Science

Handler on Modern Social Theory

Handler thinks that modern social theory ""(dating at least from the 18th century) swings between reified conceptions of the individual (as in utilitarianism) and reified conceptions of society and culture (as in most twentieth-century sociology and anthropology)."" (138)

Like Terry Eagleton in ""Capitalism, Modernism and Postmodernism,"" Handler also critiques modernist social theory for avoiding the political and structural realities that generated the problems they sought to escape by chasing after either a reified view of culture and society or (more typical of the 19th century) of reified individual.  He writes: ""The modernist's quest for what Sapir called genuine culture was motivated in part by their perception that an atomistic, rationalistic science had destroyed tradition.  But the modernists' genuine culture cannot, in the final analysis, be discovered by a social science that constructs cultural wholes on individualistic principles.  Indeed, embodied in governmental policies, modernist social science paradoxically leads away from holism to the routinization of all aspects of social life, bureaucratically fragmented and administered."" ( 138)On this he also cites his 1988 book.

Like Sapir, who Handler woudl probably say just pursued the individual, Benedict also didn't get these underlying political realities according to him.  She tried to avoid them by pursuing an ""individualizing vision"" of cultures that saw cultures, famously, as if they were personalities.  This worked against, however, the hermeneutic and comparative tendency that he mentioned on p.135.   

Essentially, then, he's accusing her of seeking a view in which the individual could find pleasure in giving in to the corporate hierarchy.  You can see this clealry in these lines: ""In <i>Patterns of Culture</i>, Benedict discovered the authentic, holistic cultures she sought and from which the modern world excluded her as a participant.  She describes the Apollonian, anti-individualistic Pueblos with an almost utopian longing, for in them, apparently, the surrender of individuality to society is not even problematic."" (138-139)  

Handler thinks Benedict's notion of detachment is wrapped up in this position she charts out.  Look carefully at this paragraph on 138-9.  If Benedict sought society's in which giving in to the whole was not a problem, then Handler says she was willing to admit that  individuals in such societies were ""unself-conscious in their individualism."" (139)  That unself-consciousness he think would not have been consistent with Sapir's emphasis on sincerity, which he thinks implies, self-consciousenss [Except that Sapir was saying that the culture, not the individual, was sincere; the indiviudal self was just active on the social forms].  In any case, regarding Benedict he writes: ""Sincerity imples self-consciousness, and Benedict sought worlds in which meaningfulness and participation could exist without such awareness.  The Northwest Coast potlatcher could pursue megalomaniacal successes unhindered by modernist self-doubt."" (139)"
"Sociology and Scientism: The American Quest for Objectivity, 1880-1940","<p>Dissertation Revision note upon reading Bannister<br /><br />Could add a historiographical point probably to chapter 1 that would position the Boasian anthropologists in relation to the sociologists. The point would be something like this: ""While the 1920s sociologists turned to extreme forms of objectivism in an attempt to totally exclude the subjectivity of the scientists, the anthropologists embraced a radical form of self-reflexive subjectivity."".<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">&nbsp;</span><br /><br />That statement could come after a paragraph in which I really stress hard the way sociology had turned to social control.

She says that feminists have shown that ""some contexts are better than others at providing women with geunine alternatives from which they can choose."" 

So says she will use these ""lived experiences of women to demosntrate how existing freeom theories fail to challenge the duality of internal and external dimensions of freedom; and I argue that attending to women's experiences requires political theorists to rethink the relationship between these two dimensions.""

History: Professional Scholarship in America,"p.073 New Audience after WWI

Higham describes a new audience after WWI.  Interesting description.  Noteable is that it is a fragmented audinece of professionals with leisure time
seeking integrative undrstanding: 

""After World War I a new audience for the serious writer emerged in America, and it has been gaining maturity ever since.  It has neither the homogeneity nor the assurance of a position and tradition that belong to the aristocracy of culture.  That older audience was unified by its consiouscness of itself as a social class with certain well-defined responsibilities, and it also shared common intellectual interests shaped by the standard educational curriculum that prevailed through most of the nineteenth century.  The new audience, much more fluid and diversified, rests on a broader basis.  It has grown from the extraordinary expansion of higher education in recent decades, from the multiplication of specialized white-collar occupations, and from a concomitant increase in leisure time.  its intellectual interests reflected the multifarious content of modern higher education and the immense variety of opinion-making agencies.  It seeks knowledge nto out of a moral imperative but out of a need to integrate and understand its discordant experience.  The current 'cultural explosion' is only the most recent manifestation of the rising level of taste and activity on the part of this hungry and restless audience."" (73)"

I felt that Shavit lost his balance a bit. Lydda is a city in the middle of Israel, near Tel Aviv, near an airport. It was a heavily Arab city, and because of its location it was a place where there really could be no Arabs. In 1948, the early form of the IDF drove out the Palestinians there, sending them in a column toward Jordan. It was the result of no expulsion order, because that was something that the Israeli leaders were aware they could not do, but there was a brutal massacre of Palestianians in a Mosque, and then a suggestion that they leave, or else... </span></p>

Then the state of Israel takes action, starting in 1952, such that things do get much better. Isarel becomes a social democracy. And Shavit describes taht this way: ""The newborn state was one of the most egalitarian democracies in the world. The Israel of the 1950s was a just social democracy. But it was also a nation of practicality that combined modernity, nationalism, and development in an aggressive manner. There was no time, and there was no peace of mind, and therefore there was no human sensitivity. As the state became everything, the individual was marginalized. As it marched towards the future, Israel erased the past. There was no place for the previous landscape, no place for previous identities. Everything was done en masse. Everything was imposed from above. There was an artificial quality to everything. Zionism was not an organic proccess anyore but a futuristic coup. For its outstanding economic, social and engineering achievements, the new Israel paid a dear moral price. There was no notion of human rights, civil rights, due proccess or laissez-faire. Therew as no equality for the Palestinian minority and no compassion for the Palestinian refugees. there was little respect for the Jewish Diaspora and little empathy for the survivors of the Holocaust. Ben Gurion's statism and monolithic rule compelled the nation forward."" (151) </span></p>

Panopticism and Publicity: Bentham's Quest for Transparency,"<p>Random Note 1: Romanticism as basis for critique of equal distribution of resources</p>
<p>Part of Rosenblum's argument about the usefulness of the romantic challenge to liberalism is that romanticism cannot be dismissed as ""unrealistic."" She writes:</p>
<p><em>""'Another liberalism' is not romantic in the dismissive colloquial sense of being unrealistic.  Romantic recastings of liberalism may not address immediate political issues or prescribe political action, but they do offer a perspective from which to cosider quesitons such as material distribution.  Evaluating the material conditions for free self-expression, for example, is a legitimate project for political theory--and no mor eor less difficult than evaluating the material bases for democratic equality or mutual respect."" </em></p>
<p>This argument I think is very strong.  One, it seems to echo Walter Benjamin's qualification about historical materialism's concern with the material things: namely, that it does not eschew the significance of spiritual problems.  In Section IV he first quotes Hegel and then makes is point:</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 13px;"">

She notes thatthey also needed to rely still on male support but that ""[o]n issues regarding children, powerful men listened towomen and were willing to act on female advice."" (41)  When the issue became the subject of a special conference as a result of Roosevelts attempts to push the bill...the 
Conference on the care of Dependent Children"" (42) , female reformers were there in great numbers 30 out of 215.  Addams and Wald delivered two key addresses.  Key pages here and very interesting are 44-45 where she discusses the disagreements between the feamle reformers and the male majority at the conference over the 1) the role of the government (top of 44) and 2) the proper role of science (bottom 44).  Men believed such an organization overstepped constiuttional limits on a governmental agencies and that social sciences should not be explickitly political (she cites Furner here).  

Muncy explains the women's refusal to ""divorce social investigation from political engagement."" (45) She argues as she did earlier that women had a ""gender-specific need to reconcile their professional goals with Victorian ideals of womanhood, and htis need produced a version of professionalism and a justification for public participation peculiar to women [profssionals]."" (45) She speaks then of an insistence especiallyin Wald about the ""bureaucratic union of research and advocacy..."" (45)   Further, Muncy connects the efforts of female reformers to Kloppenberg's description of the search for a via media between 19th century socialism and liberalism.  (45)  Within this search though Muncy thinks that gender may have played a part in causing a tendency to imagine the stronger role of the govenrment.  (45-46)"
Women in Early American Anthropology,"p. 033-34 She claims that the men in anthropology recognized Women's role

She cites the fact that it is ""generally known that Franz Boas recognized the particular contributions women could make to anthropology and welcomed women students who were willing to prove themselves capable of the standards of scholarship he exacted."" (33)

More interesting she notes that E.B. Tylor also indicated a role for women in a lecture to the Anthropology Society of Washington in 1884 after he had toured the west where he had visited James and Matilda Stevenson.    What is fascinating here is that Tylor projected the Victorian role of man as head of house and wife into the field as useful.  (33-34, quote on 34).  The speech is E.B. Tylor, ""How the Problems of American Anthropology Present Themselves to the English Mind,"" The Anthropological Society of Washington, Transactions, v. III, 1885, 81-95 quotation on 93; and it was first printed in Science, IV (1884): 545-51."

"Reading Obama: Dreams, Hope, and the American Political Tradition","<p>1. Introduction</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Kloppenberg talks about watching the 2008 election while teaching about the American political tradition at Cambridge, UK and while having ""anxieties about the American future..."" (x)&nbsp; And then reading Obama's books <em>Dreams of My Father</em> and <em>The Audacity of Hope</em> and becoming ""convinced that these books illuminate certain neglected aspects of the present than I had seen in any of the commentaries on the election."" (x)</p>
<p>* K says that Obama is the product of three ""distinct developments.""</p>
<p>1) He thinks that it was the ""history of American democracy""--meaning the REvolution all the way to the Civil Rights and Women's Movmeents--that ""produced the institutions and the cultural characteristics that made possible Obama' rise.""&nbsp; (x) At the same time, K thinks that the ""immediate circumstances""&nbsp; of the ecnoomic recession that helped get Obama elected ""have now becomethe single greatest obstacle impeding the realization of his most ambitious plans."" (x)&nbsp; His analysis of the situtation is that the economic crisis ""resulted directly from the policies of deregulation put in place during the preceeding two decades y his predecessors Bill Clinton and George W. Bush."" (x)&nbsp; And yet many Americans blame Obama for failing to ""restore prosperity"" while they also criticize him for ""the steps he took, the stimulus package and bank bailout, which most observers agree helped prevent an even deeper crisis.""&nbsp; And here is the real lament: ""So incoherent is American public ebate that Obama's critics simultaneously blem hime for an economic situation he did nothing to cause and oppose larger infusions of money into the economy through much greater government spending, the only option that might directly address the problem.""&nbsp; (xi)&nbsp; Kloppenberg thinks--is this a Deweyian and Progressive position?--that the ""impasse"" that the nation is in ""stems directly fromthe American people's limited access to power--and their equally limited access to responsible sources of information about how the economy works."" (xi)&nbsp; K thinks that only because ""shrill, partisan simplifications domiante public debate"" Obama's cautious approach has made the right angry and the left dissatisfied.&nbsp; He thinks taht Obama's book <em>The Audacity</em> ""explains the short-circuiting of American democracy in the tweneith century and illuminates the reasons why he faces such ntractable political as well as economic problems as president.&nbsp; His conundrum, as he understands, is the product of long-term, unresolved problems in American history."" (xi)</p>
<p>2) He thinks that ""philosophical pragmatism"" has ""provided a sturdy base for Obama's sensibility."" (xi)&nbsp; He defines philosophical pragmatism (as against vulgar pragmatisim meaning simply ""an instinctive hankering for what is possible in the short term"" (xii)) as a tradition taht ""embraces uncertainty, provisionality, and the continuous testing of hypothees through experimentation."" (xii)&nbsp; This is the philsoophy rooted in James and Dewey and he says that ""[t]he close connection between the philosopy of pragmatism and the culture of democratic decision making illuminates crucial dimensions of Obam's thinking..."" (xii)&nbsp; He notes the idea that philosophical pragmatism is not necessarily useful in times such as these when so many people are reaching back towards absolutism in moments of uncertainty... (xii-xiii)</p>
<p>3) He thinks taht Obama's thinking ""reflects the intellectual upheavals that occured on American campuses during the two decades he spent studying at Occidental College, Columbia University, and the Harvard Law School...""&nbsp; I think K is referrign here to the postmodern critiques of absolutism among other things?&nbsp; He referes to Obama encoutnering a tension between ""universality and particualrity...""

There had often been an implicit invocatoin of the ""norm"" in understandings of pathologies, but ""rigorous inquiry for its own sake into the typicality of everyday practices and opinion was a twentieth-century enterprise.

<p>p. 164.&nbsp; K really seems to come clean on his sense that philosophical pragmatism is good for representative democracy here.&nbsp; He dislikes invocations of tradition or timeless truths because sometimes our old ""understandings no longer conform the facts of our lived experience...""</p>

<p>p.183.&nbsp; K gives a bit too simple interpretation of the ideological shifts before and after the 1970s and the links to economic inequality.&nbsp; I.e. NOw there is a ""bipartisan consensus...about the desirability of lowering taxes and aroudn the theory--disproved by the catastrophic recession that began in 2008--that state regulation of the economy is less efficient than reliance on free markets."" (183)&nbsp; That shift he thinks as increased the gap between rich and poor.&nbsp; That same gap sharnk he notes between the New Deal and the oil crisis of 1974.&nbsp; ""It shrank not by accident or through siple economic growth but because of four deliberate strategies: (1) progressive taxation, (2) economic regulation, (3) support for unionization, and (4) massive investment in higher education."" (183) In the aftermath of the Reagan revolution, K says, all these strategies have ""been deemed inconsistent with American principles."" (183) And ""at least partly as a consequences, inequality has soared to level unseen at least since the late nineteenth century and perhaps unprecedented in American history."" (183)</p>

(194)</p>
<p>p.197-198.&nbsp; K asserts that the critique of inequality--that Obama participates in--is an essentially American value rooted in the Revolution.</p>
